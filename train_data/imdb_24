0 ... but a lousy film . As Maltin says this was Christopher Lee 's attempt to make a serious horror film . Well , it is serious ... TOO serious ! The plot is silly and slow ( something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again . I actually dozed off a few times ! The film is sooooo dull ! The cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a labor of love for both ( they often complained about horror movies being too violent ... well , this has NO violence ! ) . Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will put you to sleep !
0 The film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims . On the surface , it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface , what lies is a not - so - positive message about rape . Aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who can not cope all because she is a WOMAN . She needs a MAN to help her . When the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her , she does not stand up for herself . It is all left to Anil Kapoor to do all the talking while Aishwarya does all the crying.<br /><br />The director ( Satish Kaushik ) went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive . What would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way . The director is famous for being chauvinistic . His films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles . He needs to learn that just because the role is controversial , it does not mean that the character herself is strong.<br /><br />The most degrading scene in the film is when Aishwarya ' cleans ' herself after just being raped . She does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty . Though it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light , what he does not show us is whether Ash 's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing . Thus we are left with a confusing message about rape.<br /><br />The comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this . Even more so , the comedy is simply not funny . Ash is wooden in her role while Anil Kapoor does nothing but shout . The music is mediocre except for the title track , which is beautifully picturised ( the only bright point of this film ) . Sonali Bendre 's role is disappointing and pointless . Overall , what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish - mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion .
0 Probably encouraged by admirers of her much - better " Orlando " , Potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way : she writes , directs , stars , and actually co - writes the music , including a mawkish love song . The film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her . But Potter 's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable , and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango . Perhaps if she had n't cast herself it might have worked . She just ca n't act , whether playing herself or not . Pretentious , over - ambitious , dull , and silly .
0 Dire . Just dire . The script is contrived , the acting painful , and the story just drags along . It is , without a doubt , a celebration of Sally Potter and little else . This would n't be so bad , but she 's the director , writer and star of the film , and so is just self - glorification . I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters , and the ending came not a moment too soon . It has two redeeming features . First is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely , particularly in Paris , and look rather good in black and white . Secondly , whether you 're a fan of tango or not , the music is by and large , excellent ( except where Sally starts singing ) . Watch this film at your own risk , or if you need an unintentional laugh . I am sure it appeals to someone . Statistically , it has to .
0 Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat , uninspiring drivel . If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter , would n't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance ? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes , which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance , were instead awkward and painful to watch . Obviously , revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting , and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness .
0 This is the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen quite a few movies . It is passed off as an art film , but it is really a piece of trash . It 's one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing , but that can not make up for Sally Potter 's disgustingly obvious tribute to herself . The plot of this movie is nonexistent , and I guarantee you will start laughing by the end . Especially where she starts singing . It 's absolutely unreal .
0 The dancing was probably the ONLY watchable thing about this film -- and even that was disappointing compared to some other films . My gawd!<br /><br />To me , this is the worst kind of film -- one that assumes it 's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film - as - art . Yes , it 's beautifully photographed , but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself . Tango is a tease , it 's hot , it has drama , it 's audacious -- precisely what this film is not .
0 Wow what a great premise for a film : Set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons . Hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango . Gosh I wish I had that knack for genius . Yes I`m being sarcastic.<br /><br />It amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . Come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan ( I do concede they do exist judging by the comments ) or a die hard member of the Sally Potter fan club ( ? ) there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . Even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road < br /><br />Coming soon THE REVIEW LESSON where a failed screenwriter from Scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen . Gasp in shock as Theo Robertson puts the boot into the latest Hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . THE REVIEW LESSON coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie < br /><br />PS Sally Potter is unrelated to Harry Potter
0 Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever . And as for the feminist polemic , it 's laughable . I saw this garbage when it was first released and though I found it tedious beyond belief I 'm glad I did go to see it . That 's because I now have an immediate answer to the question ' what 's the worst film you 've ever seen ? ' Plus , I have the comfort of knowing that every film I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson . But I have to admit I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world ( as is revealed in the closing credits).<br /><br />I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film . All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes , a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady , and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public . So why should n't she think she could get away with the self - indulgent nothingness that is The Tango Lesson ?
0 The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel . Since the real star , Dolph Lundgren , would not be able to reprise his role from the original , there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write - off . Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White . To their credit , they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement . Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film , and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role . For once , his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times , and it does not get irritating . The problem from the audience 's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films . And therein lies the problem . You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action . You go because you want comedy , however unintentional.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to many people , Universal Soldier was followed by two direct - to - video sequels . I have only seen the first , which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke . Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career , the sight of Jean - Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief . The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct - to - video sequels , and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original . After years of investigation and explanation , the Unisol project is still going ahead , with some minor modifications . For one , the new Unisols are stronger and more damage - resistant than their earlier cousins . For another , all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH . In the early parts of the film , SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.<br /><br />Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes , we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut . The Unisol project is on the chopping block , which essentially means that SETH will be turned off . SETH , somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained , decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down . His only problem is that every so often , a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown . Two individuals possess the code in question . SETH kills the first in short order , and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme 's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be . The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols ' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly . A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film , but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.<br /><br />The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés . When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White , we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over . He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity 's weakness(es ) . Gee , SETH , you mean they will not be our strong points ? All kidding aside , the short length of the film is both the film 's weakness and its strength . It leaves the action without adequate setup . In the original , we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols , how they work , and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film . Here , the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate . At least in the original , a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice . Here , one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform ( and presumably his body ) , getting up every time without stopping for breath.<br /><br />I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner . If you can see it on the cheap , knock yourself out . This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre .
0 OK I saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it 's Unisol 's best movie now plot Luc Devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner Maggie , who 's been through countless hours of training and combat with him , to refine and perfect the UniSol program in an effort to make a new , stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated , intelligent , and agile . All of the new Unisols , which are faster and stronger than their predecessors , are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called SETH , a Self - Evolving Thought Helix . When SETH discovers that the Universal Soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts , he takes matters into his own " hands " to protect himself . Killing those who try to shut off his power , and unleashing his platoon of super - soldiers , led by the musclebound Romeo , SETH spares Deveraux , only because Deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built - in program that will shut SETH down in a matter of hours . With the help of a hacker named Squid , SETH takes human form . Not only must Luc contend with ambitious reporter Erin , who wo n't leave his side , but Luc also must contend with General Radford , who wants to take extreme measures to stop SETH . SETH has also kidnapped Luc 's injured 13-year - old daughter Hillary , and is now holding her hostage . Luc is the only person who can rescue Hillary , because Luc knows firsthand how a UniSol thinks , feels , and fights . now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just - so - happened to be there and The soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when Vanne Damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when Luc is now human and Seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other Unisol and Luc can take a hit from him . with the final fight when Luc smashes him to pieces I was really surprised that the pieces did n't melt and reform him ( Terminator 2 ) . another thing that bugs me is how the hell does Vanne Damme get good actors to play relatives I mean in the case of Vanne Damme it 's completely off the grid of how Science Fiction this movie is . The Music Score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you 'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well Universal Soldier 2 is like that . The good points are there 's no Dolph ( HOORAY ) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many ( I 'm still haunted by the scenes in # 1 ) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists ( if you do n't believe me look it up )
0 I do n't think any movie of Van Damme 's will ever beat Universal Soldier but u never know . This movie was good but not as good as 1st . VD returns a Luc & must do battle again . He tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle . VD has a kid this time from Ally W. , good it showed a pic of them 2 . Goldberg was cool , he does his famous move - forgot what its called cause i do n't watch wrestling - sucks . VD & Goldberg had some good fights . It was the ending like the 1st but just not that good . VD does his best move in his career , like always - the HELICOPTER KICK . Even though , the final ending should 've been longer . Anyway , it is worth seeing but it will never top the original .
0 Jean Claude Van Damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of Universal Soldier . But , did that movie saved him ? I think he goes to hell , after he dies . < br /><br />In the first minute , we see the inside of a facility , where you can see the bad guy of the film . Scary , huh ? But not as scary as the acting ( details are following ) . < br /><br />Then , we see Van Damme with a black girl ( do not remember the name .... well it does n't matter anyway ) , trying to escape from some muscle - men . Of course they are the new Universal - Soldiers . More muscels , less brain ( just like the movie ) . After a while , Van Damme fights Goldberg but then the " mission " gets aborted . It was just a test ( Is this movie a test for our nerves ? ) . It turns out that Van Damme works for the government on the new Universal Soldier project ( Who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing , that yould Van Dammes character could do ) . But it is a sequel . And a " story " has to come up . Ah , I forgot . He has a daughter . Very important for the " story".<br /><br />Well , after about 20 minutes , a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project . Of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone . Van Damme escapes from the facility BUT the computer sends some soldiers hunting him ( It wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best ( really ? ) ) . And guess what , Goldberg is one of the hunters , who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked . Funny ? Yes , just like the rest of the film . < br /><br />After some " story " , Van Damme tries to rescue his daughter ( of his wife - the reporter in the first movie ) . It comes to a final show down where Van Damme fights the Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie ( please see for yourself . It is just too funny to tell).<br /><br />You'll see that this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />So do not watch it . But if you do , keep a sixpack with you !
0 After seeing the low - budget shittier versions of the " Universal Soldier " franchise , I hoped and prayed that Van Damme reprised his role as Luc Devoreaux in a second Unisol movie . Well , it seemed this prayer was answered , but not the way I hoped . Universial Soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library . No , even that would be more intriguing . The fight sequences are top - notch , Bruce Lee quality , which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture . That and having former WCW tough - guy legend " Goldberg " playing the villain . However , placing Goldberg as Seth 's sidekick lieutenant would 've been better.<br /><br />We offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself . It 's like some film school students slapped it together . The plot holes are that bigger than Kanye West 's ego is what really did this movie in . For example : Luc 's daughter , Hillary looks like she 's at least 11 - 13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago . How is that possible ? Tell me that ! The part in which Luc 's partner was killed off and turned into a Unisol is just re - goddamn diculous ! You mean to tell me that there was an experimental Unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie . C'mon . The director could 've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut . But oooh nooo ! < br /><br />Speaking of the plot , IT SUCKS ! Compared to the first movie , Universal Soldier 2 's plot watered down and worthless . Where 's the gritty thrills in which a Unisol goes berserk an re - enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its Desert Storm or something ? This was the dawn of the Millennium , you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia / Orwellian type of future cesspit . Corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad , sad , sad sequel . < br /><br />From what I seen : Double Impact , Under Siege 2 , Robocop 3 , and hell , even the cheap - ass / no class Terminator knock - off " Class of 1999 " is more entertaining than this !
0 This was an atrocious waste of my time . No plot . The acting was so far below par , it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what NOT to do . It is merely a commercial rip - off of the earlier Universal Soldier , which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel . Its sad that VD needs to assert his ego every few years , and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it . This kind of schlock gives Martial Arts movies a bad name . By comparison , it makes Segall , Norris , and Arnold look almost talented.<br /><br />Perhaps VD should take the Leslie Nielson track and do send - ups of his genre . At least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him .
0 This time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world . I 'm pretty sure it was Double Team , which convinced everyone that Jean - Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks . However it was this that tarnished his credibility forever . While Universal Soldier : The Return is n't as dull as Double Team or The Quest , it 's still pretty awful indeed , with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing . This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling . As I look back , not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud . In other words another clunker in Van Damme 's assembly line.<br /><br / > * out of 4(Bad )
0 I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I still could n't make it to the end credits . First time I managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest . Second time I managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting , lame SFX and extremely poor direction . Pales in comparison to the original.<br /><br />Anyone ever hear about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco ? For those who have n't let me fill you in . It 's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time ... Atari decides to release a movie tie - in game on their 2600 home console system . To cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be dumped in landfills because they could n't even give them away let alone sell them.<br /><br />What does Universal Soldier : The Return have to do with this story ? Look at the 3.2 rating and figure it out for yourself.<br /><br />Awful film ... IMDb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems does n't go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives .
0 This movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean - Claud Vam Damme stars in this movie . There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White Can not act at ALL.And this movie by far has to be one of Jean - Claud Vam Dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch Blood sport , KickBoxer or Sudden Death.<br /><br />Over all this movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10 .
0 This is the official sequel to the ' 92 sci - fi action thriller . In the original , Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers ( Unisols ) . In this one , it 's , I guess , about a dozen years later , since Van Damme has a daughter about that age . Now he 's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500 , for some reason . As usual , something goes wrong : the on - site super - computer ( named Seth - like the snake in " King Cobra " the same year ) goes power - crazy , takes command of the Unisols , and even downloads its computer brain into a new super - Unisol body ( Jai White ) . We 're lookin ' at the next step in evolution , folks ! Most of Van Damme 's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol ( pro wrestler Goldberg ) who just keeps on comin ' : drop him off a building - no good ; run him down with a truck - no go ! Shoot him , burn him - forgetaboutit ! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out - classed(he 's even going grey around the edges ) . But , though he takes a lickin ' , he keeps on kickin ' ! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals , and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius , it manages to be consistently entertaining , especially if you 're a pro - wrestling fan .
0 I 'll be honest . The only reason I watched this one on TV is that it 's in the IMDb bottom 100 . And right now , I 'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another ' check ' on that same list.<br /><br />Van Damme is Luc Deveraux , who finds himself on a huge fight with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer pulled a ' HAL ' to defend itself . And yes , after all the obligate explosions , shoot - outs and chases he is the last one standing . Combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set - up it makes sure it 's place in the infamous list is just.<br /><br />Only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list . 2/10 .
0 * * HERE BE SPOILERS * * < br /><br />The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program , now called UniSol . The soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before . However the government is downsizing , the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened , so he takes steps to ensure his own safety . He activates and controls the UniSols and start to run mayhem . The only one who can stop them is Deveraux ( Van Damme ) . < br /><br />This movie is about one thing . Choreographed fighting . The story is bad , and is soon drowned in all fights . Whatever happens , and wherever they go , they fight . Unfortunately for this movie , it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible . Normally you 're pretty sure the hero will win , but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants . Not where one is indestructible and ca n't lose . Then the fights just become a tool to stretch time . You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes . To further lower my opinion , a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are . Well , there are n't really that lot of them , because the characters are most men ( there are at least one woman UniSol though ) , but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once . The female leads get by with this , but we also pass through a strip - club ( to use a computer no less ) with much more undressed women . These moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent - minded male audience.<br /><br />So , in conclusion , boring fights . No more , no less . Well , maybe less ... <br /><br />2/10
0 this is a piece of s -- t ! ! this looks worse than a made for t.v . movie . and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results ... war is prettier than this . jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now . no script , no story and no time should be wasted on this . i mean that . 1 out of 10 is too high , way too high . goldberg should be jackhammered for this . van shame is no actor .
0 This movie was absolutly awful . I ca n't think of one thing good about it . The plot holes were so huge you could drive a Hummer through them . The acting was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed , and that is saying alot ! ! ! And dialogue , What dialogue???To think that I was a fan of the first one ( I use that comment loosely , its more like a guilty pleasure , than anything else ) . This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud ! ! ! ! Nothing good can come of this movie . What makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you ca n't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of ! ! ! This has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time . 2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1 .
0 Van Damme . What else can I say ? Bill Goldberg . THERE WE GO . NOW we know this movie is going to be really horrible.<br /><br />I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS , knowing it would be bad . But not even I thought it would be THIS bad . The plot is awful , Van Damme is getting old ( finally ) , but unlike Arnold , his movies are as well.<br /><br />Forget this movie . Do n't see it . Ever . I would n't even be paid to see this film.<br /><br />1/5 stars - at its heart lies a wonderful , action - packed thrill ride.<br /><br / > Well , maybe not , but the marketers would sure like us to think so , would n't they?<br /><br />John Ulmer
0 I 'm sorry for Jean , after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career . This movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by Goldbeg(Romeo ) and whatever that computers name was . Also , some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary . Truly , bad movie .
0 I was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film . I did n't enjoy the first one at all , and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film I liked was Blood Sports ! After managing to sit through it all ? Avoid , avoid , avoid ! !
0 The infamous Ed Wood " classic " Plan 9 From Outer Space features an indignant alien calling the human race , " ... stupid ! Stupid , stupid stupid ! " I 'd have to say exhibit A in that trial would probably this movie , a ridiculously silly sci - fi film.<br /><br />Falling action star Jean Claude Van Damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie , Luke , a former Universal Soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers . While Van Damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels , he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the Universal Soldier series came around . So , probably cursing under his breath the whole way , he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks . You 'll find plenty of mindless violence , but I 'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing . Otherwise , you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it 's over.<br /><br />Luke is called into action against more Universal Soldiers after a really really REALLY evil computer named Seth ( makes HAL look like Ghandi ) turns all the other universal soldiers into evil , remorseless killers . Of course this is what these things are programmed to do , but in this case they are killing their creators , not " the enemy " so that 's a problem.<br /><br />I love the dumb logic of this movie . Logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as Michael Jai White does to be in this movie . Logic that dictates that the creator of Seth be a blue - haired cyber - stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than Old Faithful does steam . Logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time.<br /><br />The film also features a daughter in peril character , wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a Universal Soldier , and a romance so tacked on , I have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a GOOD thing . And when this movie ends , it ends . Not a minute after a gigantic towering finale - style explosion are the credits running . No epilogue , no where are they now , no final kiss , just explosion , hug , over . Even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible.<br /><br />While it 's no Plan 9 , US : TR is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy Van Damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths . Not to be seen on a serious stomach .
0 I first heard of Unisol 2 when I drove past a cinema when I was on holiday in America . I really did not take much notice of it until I bought the original on DVD which led me to find out about its three sequels . I subsequently started to read about The Return on the IMDB and asked friends what they thought of it . Despite their horrific criticisms of it , I still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until I saw it for hire on DVD . I was n't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the US , after all , how often is it that you see Van Damme on the big screen ? Well , nothing could have prepared me for this . It is so bad I almost cried . What a total waste of 80 minutes and £ 2.50 . It is hard to explain how bad this move is . Honestly . This is idiotic film making . No , it 's more than idiotic . I just can not believe how this got made . I can not believe that someone out there has not murdered Mic Rogers . How stupid can people possibly be - firstly , Van Damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good . Secondly , the fact that Xander Berkley , of Terminator 2 and Air Force One status , commited himself to this film . I simply can not believe the stupidity of this movie . It takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof . Here is an example : JCVD 's daughter ( yes , Luc is now a human again)- " I want my Daddy " , SETH- " So do I " . Oh yeah , and some guy tries to shut down SETH by pulling three huge levers with - wait for it - ON and OFF written on them . The acting all round is like playschool acting . I 'm sure Mr Director modelled Luc 's reporter girlfriend on April O'Neil from the cartoon Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - she refuses to go because she ' ... needs her story ' . I mean come on - how many cliches can a film possibly use ? Please listen to me fellow IMDB users - do n't touch this with a barge pole . To conclude , Universal Soldier : The Return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie . In fact , if they were n't called UniSols then you would never know it was a sequel . Luc is now a human again - what the hell ! ? ! The only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub . All the new Uni Sols look like they were dragged off the street , they are that unconvincing . This is pure torture to watch , so do yourself a favour - do n't torture yourself . P.S - Best part of the movie : Romeo jumps off a building and shouts ' Oh sh*t ' .
0 We open with Colonel Luc Deveraux ( Van Damme ) , the original Universal Soldier and his buxom Asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be Universal Soldiers . They almost kill the two , then oh wait , it was just a field test . Deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of Universal Soldiers . Why he would want to be involved in this ( if you know anything about the original ) is never explained and well beyond me.<br /><br />It 's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going . The United States government has cut the Universal Soldier 's project budget and in the process angered SETH ( the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the Universal Soldiers ) . Naturally he wo n't be shut down without a fight . So that means Van Damme has to go around and take all the new breed of Universal Soldiers out . Which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel , but that does n't stop it from becoming stupid as hell . < br /><br />For instance , one of the new Universal Soldiers is played by Bill Goldberg . Seems you ca n't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie . He 's big , he 's tough , right ? Wrong . Van Damme does n't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him ... once ... twice ... three times . The point here lost on me . Then there 's the breaking of glass . A rudimentary part of any action movie , but someone involved must have a glass fetish . You have to see the fight scenes in particular . Let 's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips . Then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck , they have SETH ( the computer ) secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black ( Michael Jai White ) . Nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem . Potentially offensive and just downright lame . He 's no replacement for Dolph , either.<br /><br />Universal Soldier 2 is a lousy sequel . It 's loud , it 's dumb and it does n't care . The original was n't anything poetic , but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level . The sequel does n't . They do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence . So give credit where credit is due .
0 This is a worthless sequel to a great action movie . Cheap looking , and worst of all , BORING ACTION SCENES ! The only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence . Only 82 minutes , but it feels like it goes on forever ! Even die - hard Van Damme fans(like myself ) should avoid this one !
0 Universal Soldier : The Return is not the worst movie ever made . No , that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner . However , perhaps no movie I have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did Universal Soldier : The Return . < br /><br />This film is a sci - fi / action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it . The acting is as bad as any movie I 've ever seen . The plot is terrible and predictable . The special effects are pathetic . In short , anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves . US : The Return makes previous Van Damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces . Some movies are so bad , they 're good . Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them . I 'm really not sure what else to say here . I doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they had n't already , but just in case : do n't .
0 This movie was so bad that my i.q . went down about 40 points after seeing it . It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it . It must of been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme .
0 There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology , which is extremely flawed . It simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis , which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe.<br /><br />Journalism 101 : tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable . for instance , the idea of civil war , chaos , looting , etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following Hussein 's demise : were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture ? doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself , rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure ? would they rather the US have declared marshall law ? i 'm sure the papers here would 've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force.<br /><br />aside from the analytical idiocy of the film , it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming " so - and - so refused to be interviewed ... " yet the questions they would 've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received . would you , as vice president , deign to be interviewed by a first time writer / producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words . they could n't roll tape of Condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions , perhaps they never watched her hearing.<br /><br />this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there . this is another biased , asinine approach by journalists - which are , by and large , unthinking herds.<br /><br />anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary . these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think .
0 This is a well made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline . The problem is , Frontline already did this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story . More troubling is the fact that the director of the film , Charles Ferguson -- a former think tank wonk , was a war supporter until the occupation went south . What did he think would happen ? < br /><br />The invasion of Poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky Nazis . And that is what this film feels like -- an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself . < br /><br />Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better -- as if any war can be better .
0 Early , heavy , war - time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices , in effort to prevent any runaway inflation.<br /><br />Using scare , guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric , which was normal for the time , the government was concern that the sudden war - time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war.<br /><br />It truly is a window into the past , historically and culturally .
0 The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic . Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out . I have actually seen better acting in low budget porn . I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene : Jim : Watch your ass Nick : You watch yours ( together ) : I wo nt leave you behind!<br /><br />The first action sequence shows how awful the production is , but its really kind of funny : Good guys have transformer weapons ! In one scene , they all have fake HK MP5 sub - machine guns . Next scene , AK-47 replicas ! And then , to top it all off , they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M-16s ! ! I think they had a budget shortage for guns , not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys . Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell . You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own . You ca n't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter . Weapons that you throw away do n't suddenly re - appear . When a gun is out of bullets , throwing it away is still pretty stupid . Unless you have no idea how to reload them .. Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes . I really ca nt believe movies like this are actually produced . This movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk .
0 I 'm sorry to say this , but the acting in this film is horrible . The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . Perhaps I got the " dress rehearsal " version by mistake . The director over - uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . The story is pretty well written , and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films . The fights seem pretty real . But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point - blank automatic weapon fire , grenades , morter rounds , and bazookas . The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen , especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards , and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet . Those bazookas need serious site calibration .
0 At first I was convinced that this was a made - for - TV movie that was n't worthy of primetime . But after a few minutes of dumb - struck awe , I realized that there was at least comic value in the over - the - top stunts and c - movie acting . This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I had n't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face . It was like a less - funny spy version of The Big Hit ( I laughed so much I actually bought the Big Hit DVD ) with even - worse acting . We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena , and not Jim , after all of the hugging and high - fives . A few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier .
0 There was not one original idea in this story . Themes were pulled from various sources ; a few being The Ninth Gate , In the Mouth of Madness ( another Carpenter film ) , and The Ring . It even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and using it as the film 's namesake . The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria . Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE around . Yes , I saw that the theater was playing Argento 's Deep Red . Claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop - out . This was bottom - of - the - barrel . Throwing gore and " disturbing " imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film . Carpenter used to know that . He should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine .
0 I saw this last week after picking up the DVD cheap . I had wanted to see it for ages , finding the plot outline very intriguing . So my disappointment was great , to say the least . I thought the lead actor was very flat . This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp 's in The Ninth Gate ( of which this is almost a complete rip - off ) , but I guess TV budgets do n't always stretch to this kind of acting ability.<br /><br />I also the thought the direction was confused and dull , serving only to remind me that Carpenter has n't done a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness . As for the story - well , I was disappointed there as well ! There was no way it could meet my expectation I guess , but I thought the payoff and explanation was poor , and the way he finally got the film anti - climactic to say the least.<br /><br />This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN , and you can tell he does love his cinema , but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise.<br /><br />I took the DVD back to the store the same day !
0 According to IMDb Takashi Miike 's Master of Horror - segment , Imprint , was banned in the US . So I figured I 'd translate the Swedish review I just wrote for it ... <br /><br />It was hard to NOT have any sort of expectations from Ichi The Killer - director Takashi Miike 's episode in the Masters of Horror series . And the DVD - cover of Imprint did in deed look very promising.<br /><br />The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese bordello , some time during the 19th century , and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for Komomo , the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for . Tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello , hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey . It turns out that one of the prostitutes , a deformed and quiet girl , know about Komomo , and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left . The story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow ... <br /><br />The first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent American - English . But I will leave it at that , it 's not that big a deal . What IS a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was . Miike 's tale moves at such a slow pace that I could n't help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes . The extended torure - scene , that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie , felt so unmotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that not even THAT scene became interesting . I felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself - with no sense of style or purpose . The only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water ... and , in all honesty , the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust.<br /><br />The journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago , for me most memorable as Frank Nitti - Al Capones whiteclad assassin in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables ( 1987 ) . I 've always found Dragos portrayal of Nitti to be very icy ( and I mean that in a good way ) , and that is probably why I was almost annoyed when I found him to be so terrible ( NOT in a good way ) in this one . His acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting . When his character is supposed to react to the awful things Komomo has been subjected to I was sitting in the sofa , twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by Drago . I 'm grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh ( Memoirs of a geisha , 2005 ) , who plays the deformed prostitute.<br /><br />The finale is probably supposed to be chocking , maybe even revolting and horrid , but I just found it to be kind of ... you know ... " blah " ( and I looked at my watch again , for the umptieth time , just wishing the crappy episode would end ) . Maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit , but that 's only because I could n't help thinking of an episode of Red Dwarf , and the upside - down chins of Craig Charles and Danny John - Jules , with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens ... Lucky you , if you 've seen that episode and now decide to see Imprint , I will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you.<br /><br />My first thought , when Imprint finally ended , was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it , was hearing the main title theme by Edward Shearmur ( the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series ) , and that - if anything - is a big friggin warning , do n't you think?<br /><br />One might point to the costume design , by Michiko Kitamura , and say that there , at least , is something NOT lacking in style and refinement ... but there are so many other films and TV - shows that is so much better at showing off the Japanese " geisha - fashion " . This is nothing but inferior and I am disappointed . Takashi Miike 's Masters of Horror - episode is boring , uninspiring and pointless . In other words ; It 's really , really BAD !
0 Horror fans ( I 'm speaking to the over 12 's , although if you 're under 12 I apologise for what you might deem an insult ) : In short , if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written , original storytelling , punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares , and delivered via convincing performances , then I can heartily recommend - AVOIDING THESE STEAMERS - made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date . It 's no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980 's . Not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys ( or indeed the 80 's ) because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of Argento , Carpenter , Landis , Dante and Barker ( Actually Clive , WTF are you doing in there ? ! Glad to see Romero had the good sense to give it a miss as I 'm sure he was asked to partake ... ) . More perhaps we should point the finger at creator Mick Garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill - advised TV remake of Stanley Kubrick 's masterpiece ' The Shining'.<br /><br />Perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today . Are we so starved of good TV horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets ? Sadly , maybe so.<br /><br />Normally I would n't see the point of adding a comment that does n't argue the faults and merits of a production , I 'd just rate it accordingly . However , as this series is woefully lacking in any merit ( with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune ) I write this as more of a warning than a review : DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY . If you disagree with me then it 's more than likely that you have n't seen enough decent horror . Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start , but if these ' Masters ' of Horror were being assessed on these works alone , they 'd never have been allowed to graduate with even their Bachelor 's degree . Unless of course they were studying for a degree from the University Of S**t .
0 Some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series . Particularly the writing . OK , the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink . I 'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage . Nothing new or genuinely interesting . Few of them are visually creative . It 's just typical fabricated Hollywood crap , uninteresting , childish , poorly conceived and in some cases , flat out laughable . Much like Tales from the Crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity ! Other then that this series blows hard . I get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth - graders to write the episodes . Maybe they did .
0 I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 . The premise was very simple and appealing : each episode would be a one - hour mini movie directed by a famous , noteworthy horror director . Then , when I finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown . Some good episodes emerged from that first season , but all in all it was a mixed bag . I attributed it to the learning curve , and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better.<br /><br />Boy , was I in for a shock . At least season one had a few good stories here and there . Season 2 ( with the exception of " The Black Cat " starring the excellent Jeffrey Combs ) was a complete and total loss to me . The episode " Sounds Like " may very well be the worst thing I have watched on TV in the last 10 years , and most of the other episodes are n't much better . I really hope that season 3 turns this around next year , but I 'm not holding my breath .
0 Honestly , the concept behind " Masters of Horror " had something going for it . Big - time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again , I was all for it from the start . That is , until I watched some episodes ... Oh boy , it 's really bad TV . Not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits , but there seems to be guidelines as well , like shooting in HD for example . To make a long story short , it 's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons . I can not help but compare to the " Tales From The Crypt " , and the M.o . H. episodes really do n't stand the comparison . TFTC was good , MOH is bad ; according to me here are a few keys to explain it : TFTC was shorter ( around 25 minutes for each episode ) than MOH ( 50 minutes per episode ) , I believe it allowed denser screenplays , with good ideas reoccurring more often , better overview of an episode , less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring . Duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on TFTC : directors got to have REAL film music composers ( composers on MOH are if inexistent , very bad ) , REAL actors ( whereas on MOH it 's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor ! ) , REAL directors of photography and , it can help sometimes , REAL film cameras ( while MOH is shot on HD cameras with very wrongly chosen lens - pieces ) , the result of which being that the episodes of TFTC looked and felt " cinematographic " in the sense that there was real actors being casted , ranging from Michael J. Fox to Tim Roth to Kyle McLachlan to Kirk Douglas , but there were also film composers behind it , of the range of Alan Silvestri , great directors of photography like Dean Cundey , high - end screenplay writers , and in that sense each " Tale " was a little movie of its own true kind . Compared to TFTC , the " Masters of Horrors " is quite a lame approach to TV horror . It 's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average , because it looks the same as any ugly TV serial , if not worse . It gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast , within the first 10 minutes usually . The actors are never - heard before wannabes ( except for Fairuza Balk , Robert Englund , Angela Bettis and a few , but even there , they are the only famous actors of their episodes ) . The director base for MoH was good in the beginning , but it 's getting worst and worst with every episode : now if even the directors are unknown to the world , what remains ? Nothing ! And it 's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they have n't even had , say , Stan Winston , Dick Maas , William Lustig , Sam Raimi , Eric Red , Robert Harmon , William Friedkin , Jim Muro , Stuart Gordon , Russell Mulcahy ... If even " Masters of Horror " can not bring dead directors back to life , who will ? Maybe a rerun of Tales from the Crypt will .
0 With the exception of FAMILY , this new season is worse than Season One . I ca n't imagine what they are thinking . As a fan of horror , can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem , but this series gets worse with each outing . I ca n't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day , toiling to churn out such crap . STORY ! Is that too much to ask for ? CHARACTER ! How can we give damn about the fate of ANYONE in these stories ? If we are not engaged , who cares if they get carved up or whatever ? Almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting , going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting . Even Dante 's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion . Ironically , the production values and performances tend to be up to speed , while the content is utter crap . I have great hopes for Exec Producer 's Garris 's VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS , but we shall see .
0 I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school . As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new . Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through . It had an interesting side to it but it just does n't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original . We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him , we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust , then we have the father who is always gone . Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does . On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling . Everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl , they get together , have sex and then boom we have a little kid . Perhaps it could 've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved I 've seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and that 's pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted . So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I 've seen was Juno . So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message . Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity . I really hope someone decides to either re - make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential .
0 * * * SLIGHT SPOILERS***<br /><br />A hunchback 15-year - old boy kisses a very cute 15-year - old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time . After the act , he lays in the bed with her not touching her . The next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years.<br /><br />This is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality , or perhaps a medical drama about a post - pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency.<br /><br />However , as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year - old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother.<br /><br />At one point , his mother preaches to her co - workers who are not as understanding as they might be , " Every step of the way in this , my son has been amazing ... I have never been more proud of him ... " < br /><br />The young father 's older sister , who otherwise is cold towards her brother , begins to show pride in her sibling , " You have been cool about this , " as she gives him an encouraging warm hug.<br /><br />The 15-year - old father wants to be a father . He wants to be a parent.<br /><br />Why not ? We see the " new " baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy , happy 4-month - old infant . Just as babies were born on TV in the 1960 's and 1970's.<br /><br />Once the young father is a parent , he has found happiness . He insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper . We see the 15-year - old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen 's busy = body mother is peaking over his shoulder . Fade to black .
0 my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . That being the case I bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . I personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . Alyssa Milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as Poison Ivy , Embrace of the Vampire to name a few , the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . I 've seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures serials I saw as a child . I can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though I do n't know if it was their own choosing or not . Please . please do n't renew for another season as enough is enough , Bob
0 Do nt let the MPAA fool you with their " Rated R for extreme violence " there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t . I expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised , however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense . AVOID !
0 I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission , and let me tell you , you 'll watch anything under those circumstances . Not this piece of sh*t though.<br /><br />The first five minutes set the tone by weak porn - movie quality acting , weird out - of - the - blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior . It gets worse after that . This movie does not have one single saving grace , and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch . It 's just horrible . I 've seen quite many movies in my life and I 'm not one of those snobby know - all critics , I mean I 'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they 're bad . This one ... man.<br /><br />Steer _ well _ clear of this one , my friend .
0 Wow . I have seen some really bad movies in my time , but this one truly takes the cake . It 's the worst movie I 've seen in the past decade - no exaggeration.<br /><br />As a US Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan , I found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film , not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at " authenticity " to be found anywhere in the film . Not so much as the tiniest little shred . It seemed like it had been written by an 8 year - old child who got all his notions of war ( and soldierly behavior ) straight out of comic books . The film was made in Honduras , which should have been a clue , but even that ca n't fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché - ridden piece of trash.<br /><br />I could try to list all the endless technical flaws , but it would take virtually forever . From the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since WWII , and the character 's name tags , like " ColCollins " ( worn by the character " Colonel Collins " ) , which was actually spelled using the reversed , mirror - image " N " of the Russian alphabet ( not the US alphabet ) the list just goes on and on . The uniforms , the equipment , the plot , and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves -- every single scene was just chock - full of ridiculous flaws , inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichés.<br /><br />Neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable . It was all laughably childish , in the extreme . This was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre - pubescent boys , and I have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd.<br /><br />In short , this film has absolutely NO redeeming qualities at all . It 's a total waste of time . I 'd strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by ; it 's truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for .
0 I thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part . Since I am a filmmaker , I give it a 2 for consistency.<br /><br />The problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most , if not all , previous successful war stories . The computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story . I was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with , but did not find that information.<br /><br />It seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged . The actors were n't bad , but the plot needs more innovation .
0 While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series , the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start . Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there , the pace of The Gathering is slow , the makeup somewhat inadequate , and the plot confusing . Worse , the characterization in the premiere episode is poor . Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems , I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .
0 You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget , but the movie is still sub - par . Do nt get me wrong , B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever , but if i was an exec seeing this movie , i would nt have ordered the series . I do nt like O'Hare as an actor , the costumes are silly , and there are tons of cliches . The same can be said for most of the first season ( with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors ) ; Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle . If you are a B5 fan and have nt seen this movie , see it . If you are nt a B5 fan , dont ... you wo nt want to watch the series .
0 The real shame of " The Gathering " is not in the bad acting , nor is it in the despicably shallow plot . The real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun , even though it did have one main attraction : Takashima . I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova , even for just five minutes . She has that sarcasm , that wit , that double - edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable . Sadly , though , the " Babylon 5 " pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination . Patricia Tallman-- who never seriously returned to the series until much later-- fortunately got much better with age as Lyta Alexander , who here is little more than a whiny , tiresome telepath . I shall leave you with one final thought-- why is it that Delenn looks like some sort of outer - space frog man ( even though she is a woman ) ? Thank heavens for the way the Minbari looked later in the show .
0 Time spent watching this film was time wasted . I do not dislike science fiction . I do not reject any genre per se , since good work can be done in any genre . This film , however is not good work . I can not fault the visuals ( when not involving alien makeups ) , and the special effects are impressive . The story was not out - and - out BAD , for a trekkish comic book . But the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers ' interest / attention / money went . The direction alternated between sluggish and confusing ( one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture ) . The " acting " was mostly very bad indeed . There was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of " It was that way on the page and the director told me I was supposed to be mad / sad / scared / whatever . Okay , so it was a SF series pilot . Since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium . I 'm astonished the pilot sold the series . Or is the money also in the hands of technerds ?
0 This very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget . Dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid , chase scenes are uniformly boring , and most of the on - screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film 's last five minutes ( a briefly glimpsed port - a - potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film 's chief villain -- no prop is here without a purpose ) . The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of Rodger Corman 's studio when he 'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera -- but without the discipline Corman would impose .
0 I saw this movie in its own time period , when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life , but stamped your child as a bastard . In these days of ' single mothers ' that may seem very far - fetched , but it was very true . And I 'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering , either . Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie funny . At that time I did n't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had . I did know who Betty Hutton was , and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic . I loved " Bringing Up Baby " , but I find this movie just embarrassing . I 'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked , but I was the one needing a drink after watching this again . The idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to ' get married ' and get pregnant just added to the misery . An entire town could turn on you under these circumstances , so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part . Of course , shoot me , I do n't like " It 's a Wonderful Life " either .
0 A lot of other reviewers here , including many whose opinions I respect , hold this slice of European sleaze horror in high regard . Personally , I did n't like it at all . Its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence . Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well . Unfortunately , the infamous exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not . D'Amato 's most well known films are infamous for their high gross - out quotient . This , an early film by him , does n't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious " Anthropophagous " and " Beyond the Darkness " did . Ultimately , its an incoherent film that does n't manage to involve the viewer in any way . Without the sleaze factor either , it becomes very boring . As I said , others have enjoyed this film , but I just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing.<br /><br />There are a few pluses for the film . Ewa Aulin ( from " Candy " ) is in it , and she looks pretty hot and is often naked . However , cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film . He seems bored with the role and does n't have the manic intensity he does at his finest . The music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore . Still , this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring . ( 3/10 )
0 ' I do n't understand . None of this makes any sense ! ' , exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder . Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie , I know exactly how he feels . The story , by the film 's director Aristide Massacessi ( good old Joe D'amato using his real name for a change ) , is a clumsy mix of the supernatural , murder / mystery , and pretentious arty rubbish , the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Franco 's more bizarre efforts , but which had me struggling to remain conscious.<br /><br />Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister ( with whom he had been having an incestuous affair , before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor ) , Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman ( played by Ewa Aulin , who stars in the equally strange ' Death Laid an Egg ' ) is seen alive and kicking , the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück . After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home , where she is tended to by creepy Dr. Sturges ( Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role ) , the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück ( meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin').<br /><br />'So far , so good ' , I thought to myself at this point , ' we 've had hunchbacks , incest , some blood and guts , and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy Euro - horror ; what follows , however , is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings , ghostly goings on , and even elements from Edgar Allan Poe 's ' The Black Cat ' , to tell a very silly , utterly bewildering , and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave.<br /><br />This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb , but given the choice , I would much rather watch one of the director 's sleazier movies from later in his career ; I guess incomprehensible , meandering , surreal 70s Gothic horror just ai n't my thing ! 2.5 out of 10 ( purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness ) , rounded up to 3 for IMDb .
0 I do n't know why this has the fans it does and I do n't know why I have even given it the score I have . This is preposterous . There are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief , let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen . But , this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack , even by Italian standards . Not a giallo , this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant ' phoned in ' performances . I reckon he turned up , did a day 's work and cleared off leaving Mr D'Amato to get others to fill in . Ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough , and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place , long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle . Maybe I just was n't in the right mood !
0 It 's a hideous little production , apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches . It 's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop - motion animation . It 's weird , but it 's not the kind of fun , weird trip anyone optimistic might expect . It 's the cold , inhuman , unfriendly , sickening , even creepy kind of weird . There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie . After all , Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material . And Cosgrove - Hall did far more attractive things with stop - motion.<br /><br />Interestingly , this is a French production . As such , it re - enforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary .
0 This is a good example of how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />There is very little meaningful dialog , no context for the events , and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes . The result is a confused , clueless viewer ; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director 's commentary.<br /><br />This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is , with an emphasis on child abuse . It includes some stock footage of real , horrible acts of violence , including war time executions . Although it works in the context of the movie , I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content . This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached or the easily offended , and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors.<br /><br />The climax is anti - climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie . If you 're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it.<br /><br />The director 's commentary was a one - shot , " sit the guy down and let him talk , no cuts " type of commentary . While this is n't necessarily bad , the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college , filming conditions , co producers , bad film , and a dozen other things . The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie.<br /><br />The movie was shot many years ago on 16 mm and Super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget . Because of this , the video and audio quality is poor . That alone does not make it a bad movie , but it does make a bad movie worse .
0 First of all : I love good Splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art , but this zero - budget - flick is none of it ! The picture - quality is so damned low , the soundtrack the most annoying one I ever ( ! ! ! ! ) heard , and as for the FX ... well the super - low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie ( what this junk here is n't ) . No concept , a wafer - thin storyline , primitive acting and rare dialog - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie , each one repeated about 20 times ... same for a lot of film - sequences ( may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made ! ! ! ) The story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother , got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring , performing a show of self - mutilation . So far , so good ... But for these pseudo - art - idiot - directors , this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense ( freshly taken - out bowels are thrown on a naked , bound woman in an earth - hole ... why ? ? and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody " movie " ) ? ? ? Disturbing ? Yes ! ! Sick ? Yes ! ! Necessary ? No ! Artistically ? NO ! ! ! ! ! Everyone mistaking this cheap gore - show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch Pink Floyd 's " The Wall " to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way ... I hope this was your first and last ( ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) movie , Andrew Cobb ... ! ! ! ! And all you gore - heads out there , remember : Not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically " Art " ...
0 An Avent - garde nightmarish , extremely low - budget " film " that has delusions of grandeur . Hard to sit through . I get the message that child abuse is wrong . Wow big revelation . I had no clue it was wrong before viewing this . Yes that 's sarcasm . DON'T watch this " film " if you 're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender . DON'T watch it if you 're the least bit squeamish . DON'T watch it if you care about acting . On second thought just DON'T watch it period.<br /><br />My grade : D-<br /><br />DVD Extras : making the movie , the premiere , interview with Kristie Bowersock , deleted scenes , movie stills , Director 's commentary , 2 versions of the teaser trailer , music video by The Azoic , & a classroom video experiment
0 I bought this movie for 1 euro , not knowing what it was all about . I thought " hmmm , a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore " . It was n't funny alright . It was disturbing . Very disturbing . And I do n't mind disturbing movies but this one just did n't mean anything , except that child abuse is not a good thing to do . hmmm ... The quality of the images were terrible . The acting ... there was no acting . Just some fcked - up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes . This is probably material for sicko 's jurking off on extreme gore.<br /><br />Don't watch this . It 's not worth your time . Its just awful . I wish i never bought this.<br /><br />They should mutilate the guy who made this
0 This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow . The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again ! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear . Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />Poor film making aside , the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape , murder and self harm this is right up your alley . And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed . I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out . Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty .
0 Apparently , The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self - mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood . I use the word ' apparently ' because without listening to a director Andy Copp 's commentary ( which I did n't have available to me ) or reading up on the film prior to watching , viewers wo n't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real - life footage , but unless they 're also fond of pretentious , headache - inducing , experimental art - house cinema , they 'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis - chordant sound , terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue , this mind - numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one 's sanity : if you 've still got all your marbles , you 'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead ( I watched the whole thing , but am well aware that I 'm completely barking ! ) .
0 After being a big fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of ' Stella Street ' , I awaited this film with excitement and anticipation . Unfortunately I was left feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />I was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the T.V Episodes , and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing , as if the actors had said them once , and could n't be bothered to say them again . I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again.<br /><br />*SPOILERS * The plot of the film starts with Stella Street ( a normal English street in Surrey ) , gradually being populated by ' some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years ' , including Michael Caine , Al Pacino , Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones . All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . There are some nice moments , but on the whole , the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring . * END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />In the T.V Episodes , all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell ( including females ) , but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast . I think this was a mistake . Her impersonations were n't funny , and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do.<br /><br />If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street , you may find this film entertaining . But if you were a fan , I think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated . 4/10
0 Movie industry is tricky business - because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life , too . That 's the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an ' insightful ' film about film . And indeed , no better proof of the industry 's trickiness than seeing Anouk Aimée and Maximilian Schell trapped in this inanity . The insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like " should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self ? " " Do the latter , please . " Or : " our relationship is not only professional , it 's private as well . It 's a rather complex situation to handle , is n't it ? " " Yes , it is , my dear . " Between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees , hotel lobbies and American movie posters ( no sign of non - American film presence on the Croisette ) . Recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable , making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages . Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame .
0 Awful ! Awful ! Awful ! No , I did n't like it . It was obvious what the intent of the film was : to track the wheeling and dealing of the " movers and shakers " who produce a film . In some cases , these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are . I did n't need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are . I suppose I 'm at fault really because I expected something like " Roman Holiday".<br /><br />I'm not a movie - maker nor do I take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of ' two - shots ' ( in the main ) where the actors ( ! ) had been supplied with a loose plot - line and they were to improvise the dialogue . Henry Jaglon makes the claim that he along with Victoria Foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors , cognisant of the general direction of the film , extemporised the dialogue - and it was not always successful . Such a case in point was when Ron Silver made some remark which really did n't flow along the line of the conversation ( and I 'm not going back to look for it ! ) and Greta Scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation , because Silver 's remark was such a non sequitur . You get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to ' wrong foot ' the other actor and break his / her concentration . Another instance of this is when a producer tells Silver to " bring the & * % # @#^ documents " ( 3 times ) . Silver looked literally lost for words . I have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too!<br /><br />The fact that Jaglon was able to attract Greta Scacchi ( no stranger to Australia ) , Ron Silver , Anouk Ami , and Maximilian Schell suggests it was a ' slow news week ' for them . Peter Bogdanovich had a ' what - the - hell - am - I - doing - here ' look on his face at all times and I expected to hear him say : " Look , I 'm a director and screenwriter - not an actor " - which would have been unnecessary to state ! Faye Dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son , Liam . Apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue , the hand - held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude - as I suspect the " natural " dialogue was - and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot . That at least approached Cinema Verite . So that , along with the irritating French singing during which I used the mute button , made for a generally disappointing 90-odd minutes.<br /><br />I think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this . Trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided . There was really nothing avant - garde about it . It did n't come across as a work of art and yet it was n't a documentary either . I know , it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining . I was bored out of my skull ! It did have one redeeming feature : it pronounced ' Cannes ' correctly so I gave it 3/10 .
0 I do n't remember a movie where I have cared less about where the characters have come from , what happens to them or where they are going . I realize that Hollywood 's greatest pastime is navel - gazing , but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with . For what it 's worth , though , the discussion that followed the showing , under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series , did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics . I disagree .
0 < br /><br />I recently viewed this atrocity in my film program , and I thought it was awful , as I said in my tagline , it was pretentious , trite , petty and phenomenally self - important.<br /><br />I consider myself a fan of film , and all the things that film has to offer . If I want to watch a documentary on the Cannes Festival , I will watch A&E .... and they would probably be alot more objective about it.<br /><br />I do nt recommend it , period.<br /><br / >
0 An annoying experience . Improvised dialogue , handheld cameras for no effect , directionless plot , contrived romance , ick ! to the whole mess . Ron Silver was the only real actor . Gretta Sacchi was TERRIBLE ! Henry Jaglom did better with Eating which suited his style much more .
0 When childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie ; it 's touch and go whether you should revisit it . Anyway , I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by Jeff Kober.<br /><br />"The First Power " is not a very good movie , sad to say . It 's chock full of those cop clichés and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through ( along with countless convenient " twists " that help the story run along ) . Lou Diamond Phillips is the over - confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer Kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across . Through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case.<br /><br />Ahhh , this is trash . But enjoyable as such , especially if you have fond memories of it . It scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good . As for any kind of logic here ; forget it , just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a Steven Segal action flick and a 70 's demonic flick . And who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here ? Needless to say he 's not convincing at all but he tries his best and I 've never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have . As for Tracy Griffith as the psychic , the less said the better . But Kober is pretty good as the killer ; always liked that actor.<br /><br />"The First Power " may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day 's work and a " brain switch - off " is needed . Beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and I 'll definitely have loads of it the next time I give this movie a spin . All in all ; not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids . " See you around , buddy boy " !
0 The only thing that The First Power really has going for it is that it affords Jeff Kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he 's done so well in the last 25 years . Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger who specialized in those parts back in the Fifties.<br /><br />But it 's not enough , The First Power is a souped up slasher flick that has Lou Diamond Phillips wasted as an LAPD detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers . Kober is his latest catch , but Kober 's in league with a lower power and they 're going to team up and make Lou 's life miserable for him . Even after Kober is given the gas chamber , his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises.<br /><br />Mykelti Williamson is on hand as Lou 's partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights are around to help Lou . Will he succeed in battling forces from beyond?<br /><br />By the time the film ends , you no longer care . Lou really got trapped in a turkey . Maybe the devil made him do this film .
0 Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has a major problem on his hands . The serial killer , Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober ) , for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess(Tracy Griffith)helped him capture , has been resurrected with The First Power( .. given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak . Somehow , Russell , who joins forces with Tess( .. who has an understanding of what they are up against ) , will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands . They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen)who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power , but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing .. a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil . She 'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell , who 'll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual / ceremony.<br /><br />In the film , Mykelti Williamson , always a reliable welcome supporting actor , gets the partner of Russell role .. so you know what will happen to him . As in films of this type , everyone around Russell is dying , but when he attempts to kill Channing , he 's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses.<br /><br />Pure occult rubbish .. stupid from the gate to the finish line . Phillips and Griffith try , I 'll give them that , but in a flick like this they do n't stand a chance . Kober , who is normally often always effective as the heavy , is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips .
0 I jotted down a few notes here on THE FIRST POWER , Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips ' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell - fest ... < br /><br />1 ) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison . I only hope that he can find Armani prison wear to go off in style with : One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in $ 4500 designer overcoats , a $ 7300 designer silk suit , and seeing his $ 3500/month Los Angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh.<br /><br />2 ) Leading lady Tracey Phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin , flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed , and amazing breasts that are hi - lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to Satan . At least back in the 1970 's our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them , though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination . By the final 10 minutes of the movie all I could think about is what her breasts probably would look like.<br /><br />3 ) Professional Psychics living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million dollar condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide that he was roughing it . As a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in David Lynch 's MULLHOLLAND DR . , which at least had the good sense to make it 's condo resident a successful movie director . The only Professional Psychics I have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud.<br /><br />4 ) I forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful , and his " How 's it going ' , Buddy Boy ? " line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since " THANKS FOR THE RIDE , LADY ! ! " from CREEPSHOW 2.<br /><br />5 ) Underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit Zippo lighter into them , which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous . And since Zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing , the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous.<br /><br />6 ) The stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least , and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal BOMB ratings from critics when released.<br /><br />7 ) Movie satanists always amaze me : Here is a guy who has tapped into some Luciferian bid for power , and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him , he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people 's apartments . Speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible , can fly , and is able to put his being inside of other people 's bodies -- and yet he obliges star Lou Diamond Phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film 's conclusion , yet does not have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure that he wins.<br /><br />And on and on ... To be watched in the company of wise - cracking friends while consuming beer . You 'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously.<br /><br />4/10
0 Patrick Channing ( Jeff Kober ) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who possesses the " First Power " : even after being captured by detective Russell Logan ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) and executed in the gas chamber , he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will . With the help of attractive psychic Tess Seaton ( Tracy Griffith , Melanie G. 's half - sister ) he attempts to stop Channing.<br /><br />This concept probably had some possibilities , I think , but ultimately " The First Power " suffers from routine scripting and film - making . This is nothing we have n't seen before , sometimes done better . There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers . More to the point , it 's not very thrilling and it certainly is n't scary . Phillips is a hard sell as a tough - as - nails , cynical cop stereotype , and Griffith does n't seem to be trying very hard ; best cast member is probably the distinctively featured Kober , doing his best to be supremely creepy.<br /><br />The climax is rather silly and the ending very weak.<br /><br />Not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind , therefore:<br /><br />4/10
0 People tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror / thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer ( whose name escapes me at the moment ) . Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair , he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never - ending murder spree . It 's not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on , by the way . Other low - budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise , like " House 3 " , " Shocker " and " Ghost in the Machine " . Anyway , " The First Power " ( a.k.a " Pentagram " ) is n't a completely terrible effort , but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills . The film starts off as an okay , albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop - hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims . He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium , played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith . She leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him , as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe ! Thanks to Tess ' helpful hints , Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty , but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing . " The First Power " gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit . Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world ( that 's what I would do in his position ) , Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper . He annoyingly calls him " Buddy - Boy " all the time and possesses the bodies of Logan 's friends and colleagues in order to trick him . Even though never really boring or poorly realized , it 's a very weak film to endure , mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjà - vu . Writer / director Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché ( the killer got sexually abused as a child ) and even the players ' lines can easily be predicted . As soon as Griffith explains she 's able to predict the future , you just know that , somewhere at some point in the film , she 's going to say the ridiculously overused line " I tell people who to live their lives , but my own life is a mess " . Yawn . Lou Diamond Philips ' performance is adequate enough , but it 's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of " La Bamba " and " Stand And Deliver " serious as a tough copper . There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson ( " Forrest Gump " ) , Carmen Argenziano ( " When a Stranger Calls " ) and B - movie horror legend David Gale ( " Re - Animator " ) appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film .
0 The First Power ( 1990 ) was a terrible film that came out during the late 80's/ early 90 's era of cheaply made horror films . I found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts . This movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ai n't even funny . The swift justice system in this film makes Texas look weak by comparison . Lou Diamond Phillips is in way over his head with this role ( he plays a hard - boiled cop ) and Tracey Griffith ( Melanie 's more attractive sister ) plays a psychic . Do n't waste your time with this one because it 's bad . What a minute , I take it back . This movie makes a great party film . Check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun , she has the nicest legs I 've ever seen on a Nun that was n't in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation flick . Yeow!<br /><br />This marked an end of an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished and he could n't draw flies to a dung heap . It was D.T.V. for him until his " ressurection " a few years later.<br /><br />Not recommended unless you 're desperate .
0 Well , what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some amazing actors in this ( Oliver Reed , Sarah Miles , Christopher Plummer ) but they clearly are clocking up the money.<br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant ( who looks suitably embarrassed ) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a " watchable " adaptation of Cartland , the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for ( " A Hazard of Hearts " - what a title ! ! ) . Gilbert is the weak link in that , but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act , and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek ( Edward Fox & Diana Rigg )
0 William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director / writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines . Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth ... and a scroungy town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />One tale is the old retread of " The Hook " , two teens on lover 's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand . Another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed . They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t . As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off . One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas , who ca n't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus . The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies.<br /><br />Without a big budget for special effects , CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse . A bit corny , but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale . The acting is understandably not award worthy . Cast members include : Tres Holton , Courtney Ballard , H. Ray York , Johnny Tamblyn , Walter Kaufmann , Kevin Draine , David Avin and Paul Kaufmann .
0 < br /><br />According to reviewers , the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year - old college kids about to enter grad school . Jolly joke!<br /><br />1955 ? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet , but there it is on the bandstand . The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet , but there it is playing oldies music . The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970 's . The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960's.<br /><br />20 year - old college kids ? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made - for - TV movie was produced.<br /><br />The plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their TV 's .
0 Perhaps it 's because I am so in love with the William Holden - Kim Novak version , or because I 'm not a Gen - X'er , but this was absolutely the worst remake I have ever seen . Without the original 's soundtrack , it just seemed like another typical TV movie ... yes , about as bland as Kraft cheese .
0 This version moved a little slow for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this play to begin with . But first the movie , it 's a typical TV movie version of a play which means it does n't have the flair of the original film version with William Holden . What they could n't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras ? Why move the movie up to 1966 ? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests ? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement?<br /><br />As for the casting , some hits some misses . Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin . Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes . He 's believable as an ex - BMOC jock but he does n't have the raw sensuality of William Holden . I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him ( pardon the pun ) . Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played . She did n't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required . Maybe it 's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be . But then again Holden was ten years too old . Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen ca n't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from " The Taming of The Shrew".<br /><br />As for Mr. Inge 's play , I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue . " The Twilight Zone " I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode , " Spur of the Moment " where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland , because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter .
0 Madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic , non - offensive , " family - friendly " fare and , more importantly , if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing . If , like me , you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson , Muncey , Cantrell , Slovak , etc . , prepare to be disappointed.<br /><br />Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book . I need n't repeat what they 've said . What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the " glory years " ( which many would argue were already past in 1971).<br /><br />Yes , it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast , though it was clear that the restored versions ( hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum ) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed . But where was the sound ? Much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind - numbing roar of six Allison or Rolls - Merlin aircraft engines , wound up to RPM 's never imagined by their designers , hitting the starting line right in front of you . You did n't hear it , you FELT it . Real hydro buffs know exactly what I 'm talking about . There 's none of that in Madison . Instead , every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a " heroic " musical score.<br /><br />And then there are the close - up shots of the drivers , riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines , in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home - town hero . Or , in one particularly ridiculous shot , taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a " Rocky " salute from a bridge pier . In reality , some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock - hard water at speeds above 150 mph.<br /><br />As one reviewer so aptly put it , " The sport deserves better than this." < br /><br />Finally , since another user brought up anachronisms , I 'll add one : the establishing shot of Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco Field . Neither existed in 1971
0 This is a kind of genre thing , meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you do n't . If you do , you 'll love this . Personally , I prefer the 1930s and most of the ' 40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers , and Eleanor Powell , Bill Robinson , Ruby Keeler , James Cagney , Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the ' 50s , the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off.<br /><br />This film is a case - in - point . The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me . By then , the story did n't have much appeal , either . The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus . I do n't think I 've seen a movie she starred in that I liked , including this one , where the goody two - shoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam . ( I which she had ! ) . < br /><br />However , divorcing myself from likes - and - dislikes , there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks , particularly those who liked " The Sound Of Music " a decade later . There are similarities in the R&H musicals . Thus , if you liked the Julie Andrews flick , you should like this , too . < br /><br />This is a Lavish production with , yes , a capital " L. " This is the kind of big - production musicals you rarely saw after that generation . You also get the dubbed singers , unlike today , where the actress is n't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr , as she did with Natalie Wood in " West Side Story " and Audrey Hepburn in " My Fair Lady . " < br /><br />Yul Brynner is " King Mongkut " and is the stereotypical traditionalist , the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way . He is n't " progressive , " as the left wingers like the say , but the education teacher ( Kerr , as " Anna Leonowens " ) will set him straight . Secular - progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer ! However , Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more - bark - than - bite character . Justifiably , he is the big star of this film . Brynner had magnetism . Even in " The Magnificent Seven , " Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience.<br /><br />In summary , it 's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it . I 'll leave it at that .
0 Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon 's " Anna and the King of Siam " , itself filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison , has Deborah Kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the King 's many children -- and perhaps teach the Royal One a thing or two in the process ! Stagy picture begins well , but quickly loses energy and focus . Yul Brynner , reprising his stage triumph as the King , is a commanding presence , but is used -- per the concocted story -- as a buffoon . Kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better , despite having to lip - synch to Marni Nixon 's vocals . Perhaps having already played this part to death , Brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast . Second - half , with Anna and the moppets staging a musical version of " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " is quite ridiculous , and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering . Brynner won a Best Actor Oscar , but it is feisty Kerr who keeps this bauble above water . Overlong , heavy , and ' old - fashioned ' in the worst sense of the term . * * from * * * *
0 1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir - Walter Lang ) : Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint , in my opinion , from this much - heralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece . There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal , at times , of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner -- but the movie does n't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings . I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we do n't fully understand the character 's and their situations . I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing , but even this part did n't stand out a lot for me . The basic storyline is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things . We find out later that the King is actually the biggest pupil . There is a side forbidden romance between the King 's newest wife , played by Rita Moreno(a latino as an Arab -- come on ! ! ) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though . Deborah Kerr , as the main female character Annie -- is OK but not that convincing either . The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does . This is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really .
0 I picked this one up because the music was done by Hans Zimmer , a customer of Metasonix modular synths ( made by someone dear to me ) . The jacket art says " the 2003 version".<br /><br />I give it one point for a strong female , one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster 's light blue eyes , of which there are plenty of shots of.<br /><br />It was fun seeing David MacCullum casually swimming ( the pool has a plexiglass viewing window ! ) , while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in Greece . < br /><br />The sets were marginally impressive - that is , rich people 's houses in L.A. and Mendanassos ( sp ? ) , where the castle was . I found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around . The wind was n't fierce enough to be believable to me . I kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty ... etc . and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding . I stumbled over things like why did she light a fire , blow out the match , then throw the match into the fire ? ! Dumb stuff like that . It was clunky at best . Oh well . Robert Morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it .
0 I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP 's . And this one surely is an OOP . One year after The Exorcist she 's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out , she never became a mega star . That 's one of the reason 's many of her films are OOP . She gives a good performance in this movie . It 's about a reject not recognized by her parents and does n't have any friends . Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 , that 's funny . The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity . In most editions it 's cut out , why , I do n't know , no blood is involved , okay , Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown , no T&A so nothing to offend people . But the movie is slow , extremely slow . It does n't happy normally to me but I almost felt asleep . It 's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows , no gore no nothing . Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me . If you 're a fan of Blair , buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is .
0 Tedious girls - at - reform - school flick , which plays somewhat like a prison movie . Chris ( Linda Blair ) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father . Once in the de facto jail , she is gang raped by her fellow female " inmates".<br /><br />Overlong ( even at 98 minutes ) , with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless.<br /><br />15 year old Linda Blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed , but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene.<br /><br />*1/2 out of * * * *
0 The plot was predictable , and fighting with guns gets old , but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low IQ and do n't really care about real movies . I would endulge in true art movies , like ' Clerks ' , ' Something about Mary ' , ' El Mariachi ' , or ' La Taqueria ' .
0 I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre . It was actually sold out . I actually went to see Solaris instead , which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa ( John Leguizamo ) , a tough , streetwise ' street pharmacist ' , freaks out when he sees a kid get shot , so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack ( Peter Sarsgaard ) . Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish ( Denise Richards ) . This happened very late in the movie , so had they not revealed this in the preview , it might have been an interesting twist . But they did , so it 's not.<br /><br />In fact , there 's not a single interesting thing about this movie ; everything is given away in the preview . If you saw even one preview , you saw the whole movie , so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . Go to the website , download the preview , save yourself $ 3.99 . There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film , other than how terrible the soundtrack is.<br /><br />I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired . Twice . Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets , and ( I may shatter the fabric of the space - time continuum with a concept as mind - numbing as this ) they both had less talent and musical ability.<br /><br />The acting is at best poor , the script is at best a crime against humanity , and Denise Richards is at best 67 % styrofoam and 33 % ziploc bag . You know things are bad when John Leguizamo ( he was in The Pest ! ) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities .
0 For the first forty minutes , Empire really shapes itself up : it appears to be a strong , confident , and relatively unknown gangster flick . At the time I did n't know why , I thought it was good- but now I do . < br /><br />One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful . I do n't mind films with psychos and things , to prove a point- take Jackie Brown , for example- but they 're all so terribly shallow in this , but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment . You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach . Another major problem is the protagonist . He is smug , arrogant , yet- ironically enough- not that bad . He does n't seem tight enough to be a drug - dealing woman killer . The fact is , at the end of the day , this film is completely pretentious . Not slick , not clever , just dull , and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs . < br /><br / > * out of * * * * * ( 1 out of 5 )
0 This film actually works from a fairly original idea - I 've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway . However , the way that it executes this idea is n't original in the slightest ; we follow a bunch of kids that , for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest . The fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks / nutcases / zombies etc ; but really , the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme . Many films of this ilk do n't have a single good idea - and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one . The only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they 're beautiful women that the characters lust for , rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from . This is good up until a point ; but it soon gets boring , and the almost complete lack of any back - story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the ' horror trash ' category.<br /><br />It 's been years since The Evil Dead made the woodlands a prime horror location , and in spite of films like The Blair Witch Project ; it still makes for an excellent horror setting . This is one of the film 's major assets , as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown - the only problem is that Forest of the Damned does n't ever seem to have much up its sleeve . The death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination , and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme does n't help , as you 're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away . The cast is made up of kids mainly , but there is a role here for Tom Savini ; who unfortunately does n't get to have fun in the special effects department . The only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves . The naked ladies tend to look great , and if it was n't for them , this film would get very boring very quickly . There 's nothing to recommend this film for really ; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks , you might find some enjoyment here .
0 This movie is a terrible waste of time . Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4 . I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose . This is also a " horror " film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight . My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared.<br /><br />The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries . It can not be that high in demand . < br /><br />The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie , half of the time she is British and half the time she is American .
0 Angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a British forest where they seduce and chop up teens . Talk about high concept . On the plus side this little mother gives us Tom Savini , but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen - time , his five minute presence seems a tad long . The angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie , but though they might have the body of an angel , their faces sure look like Joan Rivers on a bad day . Mediocre acting and amateurish gore - effects do n't help and the night scenes fatally recall Paris Hilton 's most famous movie . So bad that it is REALLY bad .
0 I 've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie " 1 " but this movie was beyond terrible.<br /><br />The acting was terrible , the plot was ridiculous , the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying . Usually when I watch scary movies I think it 's DUMB when the characters hears a noise in house / forest / school / etc and then yells out " hello is anyone there ? " - but at least they 're believable when they do it .. This movie could n't even get that right.<br /><br />This is a movie that 'll make other B - horror movies like Venom and The Fog look like academy award winning masterpieces.<br /><br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else who 's thinking of watching this movie will think again . IT 'S AWFUL !
0 Oh boy , where do I go with this one ? Herendous acting , weak plot , stupid deaths , pointless nudity ... <br /><br />This is n't entertainment ... this is hell.<br /><br />Hell.<br /><br />Don't waste your money , time , or life on this pit of evil.<br /><br />It 's just ... god damn is this movie awful ! Tom Savini , WHY ? ! Why would you waste your life on this crap ? This movie not worth it . I 'd rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch THIS ... this sinful act again!<br /><br />Please take my advice and stay the f#@k away from this elephant turd of a film . No , you know what ? I should n't even have to call this thing a film ! Just stay AWAY !
0 From the start this film was awful ! Why was it that bad ? ? If it is n't the naked women , not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of Colgate whitening ! ! Then it 's the ' crazy ' old guy at the gas station , who is n't so much crazy , but more " I 'm not sure how to act a great deal so I will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as I can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods " ! ! Then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis .... apparently , without touching you ... and this is according to the opening scene .... they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck , which I assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some TCP to clear it right up . Then you have Sophie Holland who plays Ally , I have never seen such baaaaaad acting , she is more of a " me me me , if I 'm not having fun no - one else is , and I do n't wanna do this so I wo n't , and I 'm the meanest cow on the planet , I 'm sarcastic , petty and if I do n't get things my way I will sulk ! " , kind of person .... reminds me more of a 6 yr old girl 's attitude . I do n't think it 's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of Blair Witch , or how low - budget the film actually was that when Judd was hacking at the ' locked ' door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side ! ! This film is completely laughable ! If it were a spoof then it would have been successful ... only just though , but , as a horror film is was just plain wrong ! ! ! I ca n't even being to describe everything that went t!ts up in this movie I would run out of room ! Although it was funny to watch Andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while Tom Savini 's character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision ! ! It was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor , which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow ! So is it any wonder they do n't get away with it ? ? And how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened ! No pain , no weakening from blood loss , nothing ! ? But the silliest part is when all of a sudden ( and i mean that literally ) it 's one YEAR later and Molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs , and then lo and behold , Shaun Hutson picks her up ... of course not without a line to promote his books ! ! ( altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors ) but suddenly , and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why ... she 's evil herself and lures Hutson to his death , then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can , even after his ' dazzling ' performance on why no - one should ever venture there for whatever reason ... cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while Crazy pours petrol everywhere .... and here endeth the film .... finally ! My conclusion .... if you had n't already guessed by now .... absolute rubbish ! There was no proper thought went into it at all , whoever was aiming the camera needed firing ... and come to think of it so did 99 % of the cast ! If the right director , actors , and budget got behind this it could have been decent . But , once again , low - budget English horror films but the rest of the genre , the country , and the English film - making industry to shame ! ! ( And I 'm English so I 'm allowed to say that ) ! In fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15 - 20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . All I kept thinking throughout this was " Jesus Christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this , its absolute cow 's testicles ! ! " But I ca n't turn a film off after I 've started watching it unfortunately . I had to watch From Dusk Til Dawn afterwards just to remind myself that Tom Savini does have it in him to act well ! If there was an option for 0/10 then believe me I woulda chose that , cuz this film is n't even worth the one point I did give it ! < br /><br />But this is just my opinion , watch it and decide for yourself .
0 Forest of the Damned starts out as five young friends , brother & sister Emilio ( Richard Cambridge ) & Ally ( Sophie Holland ) along with Judd ( Daniel Maclagan ) , Molly ( Nicole Petty ) & Andrew ( David Hood ) , set off on a week long holiday ' in the middle of nowhere ' , their words not mine . Anyway , before they know it they 're deep in a forest & Emilio clumsily runs over a woman ( Frances Da Costa ) , along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they 're travelling in wo n't start & they ca n't get any signals on their mobile phones . They need to find help quickly so Molly & Judd wander off in the hope of finding a house , as time goes by & darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone & that there is something nasty lurking in the woods ... <br /><br />This English production was written & directed by Johannes Roberts & having looked over several other comments & reviews both here on the IMDb & across the internet Forest of the Damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it & other 's not , personally it did n't do much for at all . The script is credited on screen to Roberts but here on the IMDb it lists Joseph London with ' additional screenplay material ' whatever that means , the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest & kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction . Then there 's Stephen , played by the ever fantastic Tom Savini , who is never given any sort of justification for what he does . Is he there to get victims for the angels ? If so why did he kill Andrew by bashing his head in ? The story is very loose , it never felt like a proper film . The character 's are poor , the dialogue not much better & the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that 's going on . Having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace & there are a couple of decent scenes here.<br /><br />Director Johannes does n't do anything special , it 's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at . There 's a few decent horror scenes & the Tom Savini character is great whenever he 's on screen ( although why did n't he hear Judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with Molly ? ) & it 's a shame when he gets killed off . There are a couple of decent gore scenes here , someone has their head bashed in , there 's a decapitation , someone gets shotgun blasted , someone throat is bitten out , someones lips are bitten off & someone is ripped in half . There is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity , not that it helps much.<br /><br />Technically Forest of the Damned is OK , it 's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye - catching . This was shot in England & Wales & it 's quite odd to see an English setting for a very American themed backwards horror . The acting is generally pretty poor save for Savini who deserves to be in better than this . Horror author Shaun Hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end & proves he should stick to writing rather than acting.<br /><br />Forest of the Damned was a pretty poor horror film , it seems to have fans out there so maybe I 'm missing something but it 's not a film I have much fondness for . Apart from one or two decent moments there 's not much here to recommend .
0 Well this is a typical " straight to the toilet " slasher film.<br /><br />Long story short , a bunch of teenagers / young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons.<br /><br />This movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage:<br /><br />-Naked women , -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky , -gory death scenes , -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff , but never bra less , -a creepy , crazy man who knows about the evil , -lesbian kiss scene , -sex being a killer , -no plot < br /><br />Even then for a cheesy slasher film , it was really terrible . The atmosphere is totally dead . Nothing , not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity , was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested . Watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold.<br /><br />Give the demonic ..... 0/10 .
0 The plot was very thin , although the idea of naked , sexy , man eating sirens is a good one.<br /><br />The film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie / splatter / lesbian mouth licking shots in between.<br /><br />The characters were wooden and one dimensional.<br /><br />The ending made no sense.<br /><br />Considering it had Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson in it , you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects . Some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them.<br /><br />Brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush , naturally , and of course the lesbian moments . I also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the ' shower scene'<br /><br />The film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely.<br /><br />If I had been watching this alone and aged 15 , i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes ( with 1 hand of the remote control ) , then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza ...
0 This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time . I generally like the cheap horror monster type movies , but this movie was a disappointment . The main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures . When they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them . He does n't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents , and unless i missed something the did n't say how he managed to escape either ... Not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience . It would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the " cross incident " .
0 I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini , I respect his work but this was a real let down , I had horrible clichés , half of the film was naked women so called " fallen angels " running around trying to act scary , oh and then there was the occasional " Blair Witch " black and white motion sicken camera scenes . Tom 's character was really awful , Horrible script . And you got to love these lines they use . " Is anyone there , who is out there , this is n't funny " No but your acting was . I wish I could give this flick a 0 ! Oh the names of the characters . Judd , Molly , Ally , Emilio , but they did leave out Anthony , The Breakfast Club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting .
0 Note to Horror fans : The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that 's so worthless it 's insulting.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising : It 's not . It 's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low - budget slasher films that were n't good either . < br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful : It 's not . It 's SO not . The amateur cinematography makes sure the " fallen angels " are about as sexy as the average homeless person.<br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre : He 's the king of low - budget special effects and lower - budget acting . Come to think of it , Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie . It 's not that he 's bad , but he 's almost always in bad movies . His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn , and he 's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />But let 's focus on the positive : Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie . < br /><br />Everything else is a negative . Obviously the writer is allergic to originality . The script is terrible . That 's all a given after the first 10 minutes . But the clueless pacing ; the way the director treats " plot " and " characterization " as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway ; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving , walking , and nature sequences ( no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution ) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />This is another good example of the number - one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad : If it 's written and directed by the same person , expect garbage .
0 oh god where to begin ...... bad acting .... characters you just do n't care about ... are they American or British ... they seem to think they are in America , because where else is this enormous forest in the midlands ... <br /><br />one big fault ... they are driving all night through these woods ... unless they are going around and around they 'd have been in Scotland come the morning .. when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over .... <br /><br />and they 're mobiles do n't work .. so what do they do ... split up of course , make it easier to be picked off ... so three go looking for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to ' care ' for the unconscious woman ... so what do they do , rather than make her comfortable , cushion her head , cover her up or even move her off the blooming road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 yrds away .... and all the time they have a camper van they could put her in ... <br /><br />and onto the horny angels that are supposed to have desired human kind so much that they were ejected from heaven to live amongst us ... so what do they do ? embark on sexual relations with any men they encounter? ......... no they bite huge chunks out of them and rip their heads off ... i think they are missing the point ... <br /><br />these are not gorgeous sexually deprived former angels they are cannabalistic vampires ... and as for tom savini saying how breath takingly beautiful they are .... well those gals have good bodies but nothing special in the face dept . the lead role was far more pretty than these so called irresistible sirens ... <br /><br />rubbish film waste of £ 2.30 from my local library ...
0 Booted out of heaven , a gang of horny naked female angels ( with big plastic fangs ) have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by . It 's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes   An independent low budget horror made in the UK , Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting , effects and direction I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled ' shock ' moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateurish . Throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson , and you have one real bad movie on your hands.<br /><br />Some fun may be derived from the film 's sheer shoddiness , and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour , but most will find this a chore to sit through .
0 I thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with " Book of Shadows " , I was wrong . This film makes that look like " The Magnficiant Ambersons " compared to this piece of shameless , unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie . I 'd write more but I 'm still to angry that I was idiot enough to spend £ 3 renting it , bobbins.<br /><br />And were these people English ? and where is the forest > I have lived in the UK two thirds of my life and as far as I know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands . The whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation . Those angels looked like anorexic pornstars ( turned most of them were , did my research ) . I did however like the bit when Judd got ripped in pieces.<br /><br />P.S I love and admire Tom Savini but HE CANNOT ACT
0 OK me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b - movies since we do them ourselves . Anyway , the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini ! There is just no way this movie can fail ! Right ? wrong ! ! It just seems like such a waste ! There was really no story , the dialog was terrible ( is anyone there ? x 1000 ! ! ! ) , the characters were .. well , they really lacked any kind of personality ... The effects were terrible .. and what s up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing .. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff ? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something ... anything to happen ... but no ... " oh , here comes the nymphs ! great ! oh .. they 're kissing ... again ... and now for the violence ! OK ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh , now they run around ... and the closeups of eyes ... again ... oh , heres Tom Savini ! Oh ... he died ... right ... OK , maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen .. no .. oh ! Cool ! a severed head ! the end ... oh crap .. " And finally , since i 'm so full of myself .. i 'll tell you this ! Give me a van , six actors , a weird looking house , Tom Savini , a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you 've ever seen ... I 've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects , better acting and a better script than this ... what is this Johannes guy doing ? ? Making cool movies is easy!It could have been so great ... I 'm really upset ! !
0 When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow.<br /><br />1)The teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local . Dan Van Husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly Sirens . What , who , how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst . 2)The van will break down . 3)Whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)They will find a house inhabited by a madman , he will capture them . 5 ) The house will have a phone but it will not work , it will be disturbingly decorated , there will be flickering neon light , spiders and maggots . 6)The madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that wo n't start ( here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor ) . 7)The madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap , weak scare and will then be killed properly . 8)Only a girl will be left alive from the group . 9)There will be an unnecessary twist at the end . < br /><br />Add to these elements naked Sirens ( who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately ) that seduce and kill the teens , throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie.<br /><br />I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but I am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film , Darkhunters , which is one of the worst films I have ever seen . At times the cinematography is very good , the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies . I was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity . However , the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film , it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again , but amongst the DVD extras.<br /><br />If you do rent this film I implore you to listen to the director 's commentary it is beyond belief . There is more to say about this than the film itself . One staggering part of the commentary is the director 's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea . He says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if " people will get it " . < br /><br />I'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough , acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work . If this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question ; " What was the point ? " This is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies , any attempt to do something clever or different have n't worked.<br /><br />The next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats . They rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use . However , the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when Michael Mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary . There is a simple distinction to be made here ; Mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style , Roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . I think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant.<br /><br />The best moment is reserved for Robert 's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film . Those who did n't like it are generalised as ' geeks ' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that . I must admit I was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film was n't singled out for ridicule . The tirade goes further as the group joke about Norwegian reviewers , complete with ' hilarious ' accents to imply that people from Norway would n't know a good film simply because of where they are born . As always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting , they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant.<br /><br />The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast . Robert 's swears blind in voice over , ' I did n't want to make a film that was like Baywatch ' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground . There is also a simpering , self - indulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Robert 's says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is " The best British film in years " . I do n't know who he is trying to convince . At one point in the commentary track Robert 's says jokingly " I can see people sitting at home saying " this is n't amazing , its sh$t " he is n't wrong .
0 If you liked " Blair with " you 'll like this one . It has the same lousy camera - work and soundtrack , and it has the same non - existent plot and suspenseful moments.<br /><br />It also has Tom Savini , so if you like Romero 's " Dawn of the dead " or Tarantino and Rodriguez ' " From Dusk Till Dawn " you 're in for a treat . He is an icon and a very good actor as well.<br /><br />No , seriously . This movie is definitely the lousiest movie I 've seen in a long time , and I 've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well . I can tell you that I find most horror movies entertaining in some respect , but this was just a pure waste of time.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 , was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp - looking plastic teeth ... No , I 'm just kidding . I must have missed before I hit " submit " on the vote form.<br /><br />Stay away , even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover !
0 I could n't watch more than 14 minutes of it . It 's a GREAT combination of really bad acting and really bad directing . The shots used are disgusting , they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time . My head hurts try to watch that load of " you know what " . Dirt on the " mystery machine " window make you see light from the lighting on the windows ... annoying . What else ... it 's so badly framed all the time it 's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there . I only directed short films , but I 'm pretty sure I 'd be way better than that directing a feature film .... the story is unbelievable , just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it 's gon na be pretty awful . So pretty much , try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost , it 'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental , and that 1h30 hour of your life you 'll never get back ...
0 I saw this film yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact , I know one of the actresses from the film .. I wo n't say who .. ! ( That 's kept under wraps .. ) But I must admit , it was n't as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini ? Hats down to this guy .. But it 's a shame he was n't in the film for long .. What lacks the film is the idea , the script , sound , etc .. It may look like a good movie .. but it was n't that entertaining .. <br /><br />Well , I 'm glad my Sister paid £ 10 for renting 3 DVD 's from Blockbuster .. I chose this one .. and I was disappointed . Anyway , thumbs down for me .. ! Not my cup of tea ! 0 out of 10 !
0 The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters . The different story lines do n't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times.<br /><br />It may sound weak and cliché but it 's true ; You 're way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin . It 's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is . I 'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie does n't give us the viewers much pleasure . For a comedy it simply is n't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just are n't good actors , not even when they play themselves ! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene 's feel long , distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.<br /><br />The movie had quite some potential , I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch , so when I first heard that they were making a movie about ' the crocodile hunter ' my first reaction was ; brilliant ! The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters . The movie does has a certain entertainment value , at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still , I must certainly would n't recommend this movie.<br /><br />Watching this movie felt like a waste of time . Still this movie might be watchable just once , when it gets on TV , on a rainy afternoon . It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.<br /><br />4/10
0 Some people say Steve Irwin 's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act . Watch this film : it 's obvious he ca n't act.<br /><br />Steve Irwin , dangerman star of the small screen in his * Crocodile Hunter Diaries * , * Croc Files * and eponymous * Crocodile Hunter * series ( you see a naming trend here , or is it just me ? ) , rockets his larger - than - strife persona to the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter : Collision Course * ( yup  there 's a definite trend of words beginning with ' C ' ) - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * mashed together with a B - Movie.<br /><br />On a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer ( Magda Szubanski ) , Steve and wife Terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by American spies ( Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom ) , out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed . Will it hurt my credibility to say " They 're on a Collision Course with Wackiness " ? ( what credibility ? - Ed note.)<br /><br />The plot is irrelevant , as it is Steve 's animal magnetism that propels the film . If you find his persona trying , the film is a failure , but if you 're a fan of either him ( as a businessman , conservationist or just plain ass - klown ) or his television shows , expect more of the same on a wide - screen budget.<br /><br />John Stainton , faithful liege , best mate and helmer of the Crocodile Hunter * oeuvre * ( can it be called that with a straight face ? ) , writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made Steve a household wildlife jester.<br /><br />The most jarring aspect of this movie is that Steve ( one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks ) and Terri ( Steve 's spouse of 10 years , fiercest ally and closest friend ) treat it like it IS one of their documentaries , breaking the " fourth wall " and speaking directly to the camera , whilst all the other characters behave as if they 're in a bad movie ( well  ) . It would n't be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steve 's life , we Confused Viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew does n't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics , or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting , crisp audio and seven action angles . < br /><br />While Terri is unfairly painted as Steve 's mildly incompetent sidekick ( her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear - shaped - buttock - hugging jeans - for the last , I 'm not complaining ) , Steve goes about his business - as - usual of show - and - tell with creatures intent on killing him , doing all his stunts himself because , well , to him they 're not really stunts , just a Day At The Office . < br /><br />Of course , watching this madman 's koo - koo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings . But to those of us who never met him , this kind of malarkey ( as well as various incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter * series in constant re - runs ) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows . The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him . And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints   < br /><br />So enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half - baked movie featuring a full - on legend . He died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that.<br /><br />(Movie Maniacs , visit : poffysmoviemania.com )
0 I never was an avid viewer of " Crocodile Hunter " , but did occasionally see an episode , or a bit of an episode , and when the news spread about Steve Irwin 's death from a stingray attack in 2006 , it certainly caught my attention . This movie , with Steve and his wife , Terri , playing themselves , but in a fictional story , was released in 2002 , but I did n't hear of it until several years later , and even after that , it took me a while to get around to seeing it . Well , now I have seen it , and after looking here first ( more than once ) , and seeing its rating , I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be , though it could have been a BIT better . Apparently , it 's supposed to be a comedy , so a major problem with it is that it is n't very funny at all.<br /><br />A U.S. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia , where it is swallowed by a crocodile ! While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt , and are unaware of what 's inside it , two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon ! The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley , and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them ! On Steve and Terri 's mission , they face other types of dangerous wildlife , not just the crocodile , and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it , when Steve sees the CIA agents after them , he mistakes them for poachers ! < br /><br />Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film , the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents . Apart from that , I do n't think I found anything even mildly amusing . It 's also a bit of an incoherent mess , switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters , and it seems like clips from " Crocodile Hunter " and clips from an action thriller ( or something like that ) put together for some reason . Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes , which also seem to be from somewhere else , and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt , played by Magda Szubanski , is supposed to be , she 's not . At one point , we see her farting , so we have a fart joke , a MAJOR cliché in modern comedy ! Are they SO hard to resist ? ! I also found the typical " Crocodile Hunter " scenes , with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers , to be tedious , but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show did n't help.<br /><br />Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist , and is sadly missed by them , while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him . No matter which side you 're on , " The Crocodile Hunter : Collision Course " is not a well crafted movie . I 'm sure it does help if you 're a big Steve Irwin fan , but even if you are , there 's no guarantee that you would like this movie , as some fans clearly have n't been impressed . In fact , it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have , so maybe it WON'T help . Like I said , there 's no guarantee . I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show , this movie was unnecessary . The attempt to combine what is usually seen in " Crocodile Hunter " with a fictional story unfortunately failed , and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes !
0 OK , first of all , Steve Irwin , rest in peace . You were loved by many fans . Now ... this movie was n't a movie at all . It was " The Crocodile Hunter " TV program with bad acting , bad scripts , and bad directing in between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals . He was entertaining as an animal seeker / specialist . Millions will miss him . But the whole movie idea was a big mistake . The plot was so broken , it was almost non - existent . Casting was horrible . The acting was n't even worth elementary school - level actors . The direction must be faulted as well . If you ca n't get a half - way decent performance out of your actors , no matter how bad the script is , you must not be that good in the first place . I could have written a better script . I wish I had never been to see this movie . Of course , I watched it for $ 3 ( $ 1.50 for me , $ 1.50 for my son . ) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action . My son , who is not so discriminating , liked the movie alright , but he still has never asked to see it again . If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin , buy his series on DVD . Avoid this movie like the plague . If I were Steve , I know I would n't want to be remembered for this movie . Respect him : avoid this movie !
0 I caught this at a test screening . All I can say is : What ... the ... hell ? This movie plays out about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reading the script for " Scarface . " It 's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense ; and even if you do leave your brain in the car , the film is still so bizarre that it is n't even funny.<br /><br />The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to " save " a crocodile which contains a CIA probe . The CIA comes after Irwin to get their probe back , Irwin mistakes them for poachers , and sets out to " stop " them.<br /><br />That 's about all the story there is ; the rest is over - the - top lampooning of Australian culture ( " Didja see dat ? " and " Crikey ! " ) and strangely choreographed action sequences . At one point , Irwin mounts a speeding RV and knife fights with a CIA agent on top of it . Yes , that 's right : Steve Irwin knife fights a guy on top of an RV . Let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film .
0 So , Steve Irwin . You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs , snakes , lizards , tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles , and mud , not only daily , but with enthusiasm . He was never able to make ME want to do it , but he managed to make his wife come close.<br /><br />This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled , have a migraine , or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity ( currently well populated by Disney films ) . It 's too noisy . Well , Steve is too noisy . He 's just so happy all the time , and would cut right through the blasé ' teenager ( I can hear it now : " that movie was so STUPID " ) or the Tylenol with codeine . I 'd say his enthusiasm is catching , but if it was , I would own a room full of snakes , and that has n't happened yet . I agreed they 're beauties , but I 'm still not going to pet them.<br /><br />Plot was indeed predictable . Bad guys were so bad , for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore . But the movie was filled with animals , and Steve and Terri , which is why I watched it . That plot ( if you could call it that ) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck . My expectations were low and stayed that way.<br /><br />I was hoping , though , that there would be a bit of a sequel , where Steve and Terri ( having worked on their acting skills ) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur . I still ca n't believe we wo n't see Steve anymore . I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel , at least . I ca n't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is . Crikey !
0 Gday Mates ! just watched Croc Hunter the movie . it was alright but the show seems more real . this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters . A few things : Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles . yeeeowch ! for reals you know that hurts . and ca nt they jump up high ? he s all grabbin them by the tail and stuff . There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie . when Terry find that baby joey she goes like " We have to nurture them , just like a baby " . Woah ! i thought she was gon na up & breast feed that kid . that woulda made it PG-13 though . While on Terry , did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry 's knowledge on ritual mating . she knows her sex stuffs . movie takes place in Queensland , Austrailia . I want a koala , dingo , and joey!<br /><br />Steve 's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie . albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite - wielding hottie.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone else watches this , try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc . he was eating her sheep ! ! i would be mad too !
0 Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance ? I want a refund ... Can I have my $ 16 back ? While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen , nothing did happen . The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot , which was not really like the film . why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out ? It was not very artistic . Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes ? Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading ? Or was that the point ? I felt like Phantom Love had no story at all , and to be honest I felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film .
0 After some internet surfing , I found the " Homefront " series on DVD at ioffer.com . Before anyone gets excited , the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago . The resolution and quality are poor . The images look like you would expect old re - recorded video to look . Although the commercials were edited out , the ending credits of each episode still have voice - over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program " Nightline " , complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 's . Even with the poor image quality , the shows were watch - able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />To this show 's credit , the casting was nearly perfect . Everyone was believable and really looked the part . Their acting was also above average . The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler ( most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong ) . The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets , especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor . The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time . For example , conversations between characters were sometimes inter - cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes . The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations . That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago . Despite all the ingredients for a fine show , the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start . For one thing , the name of the show itself is totally misleading . When WWII ended in 1945 , there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a " homefront " either . Curiously , the first episode of the show " Homefront " begins in 1945 after the war had ended . That 's like shooting the first episode of " Gilligan 's Island " showing the castaways being rescued . The whole premise of the show 's namesake is completely lost . I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no , the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 . Additionally , this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 's . By the third episode , it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left - wing political agenda . The show is set in River Run Ohio , near Toledo . However , the show 's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio . Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams , Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family . Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil " whites " to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable . The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years . We get it . We 're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis . The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show , as it was for " Homefront " . The acting talents of Williams , Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical " frightened / angry black family " . The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something . The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist - fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing , and leave it at that . Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />In yet another ridiculous plot line , the big boss of a local factory ( Ken Jenkins ) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees . The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro - communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />Personally , I think this series had great potential . The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories . Of course the loss of brothers , sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama . The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en - route to Europe or the Pacific . The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless . But no , the writers of Homefront ( David Assael and James Grissom ) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots . Instead , they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left - wing politics . It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage .
0 This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen . Here are the things that immediately jump out at me : 1 . The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush . Not scary whatsoever . News flash , if you are filming in the Southern California area , big bear is only an hour away . They actually have trees there.<br /><br />2 . The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced . Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal , cliché , or just plain stupid . For instance the name of the camp is " camp blood " ( lame ) , the name of the clown is " the killer clown " ( lame ) . What is a clown doing in a forest anyway ? Was that the only mask they could find ? 3 . The last but certainly the least was the acting . Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled . A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting . Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph . It 's a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy , but she was NOT . Also , and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me , was this tool who is supposed to be " athletic . " For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them . Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very " girl like " run , that he is quite far from athletic . Oh and to the girl who played Kat , good Lord stop singing . That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself.<br /><br />If for some reason you do see this movie , I would at least recommend watching the special features . The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story . In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending . Apparently she hangs out with special kids .
0 Nothing to say but Wow ! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field ? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors ' favorite scare tactic ) . In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking / hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film . Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and , although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute . After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown 's history in which we see some of his previous victims . If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest .. her ribs go all the way to her neck , it was flat out disgusting . Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day . The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard . The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically.<br /><br />Definitely RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN SNUCK UP ON IN AN OPEN FIELD.<br /><br />SIGNED , THE ANSWER
0 Camp Blood III is a vast improvement on Camp Blood II as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot . This time they 've ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness.<br /><br />This time around there 's a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants . This is hardly a new idea , I 've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife.<br /><br />Unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs . I liked how there 's a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom.<br /><br />I do n't know why anyone would want to make a third Camp Blood film , I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one . The half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me , it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for $ 5 just like they did in the second movie . They still have n't worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well , it 's a Camp Blood movie what do you expect ? If you like crap films you 'll get some fun out of this one .
0 Who could possibly have wished for a sequel to Bert I. Gordon 's legendary bad trash - film " Food of the Gods " ? Nobody , of course , but director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea , anyway , and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history . " Gnaw " is a sequel in name only , as the setting moved to a typical late 80 's location ( a university campus ) and also the cheap & cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80 's . This script hangs together by clichés , awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other ( and more successful ) horror classics . Neil Hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing - experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor . Due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists , the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus . Following the good old tradition that Spielberg 's " Jaws " started , there 's an obnoxious Dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere . During a hysterically grotesque climax , the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus ' new sport complex ! " Gnaw : Food of the Gods 2 " is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch ! The characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff ( like descending into the sewers unarmed while they KNOW it 's infested with rats ) , the acting is atrocious and there 's a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth - serum ! I wonder what Freud 's theory would be on that ! There 's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric . In case you just ca n't get enough of this junk , there are quite a lot of creature - features revolving on mutated rats , like the Italian schlock film " Rats : Night of Terror " , the modest 70 's cult film " Willard " and its lame sequel " Ben " , the 2003 " Willard " remake starring Crispin Glover and the surprisingly good recent rat - movies by once - famous directors Tibor Ticaks ( " Rats " ) and John Lafia ( " The Rats " ) . Go nuts !
0 Boring , predictable , by - the - numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of ( mindless ) mayhem and gore to satisfy ( mindless ) genre fans . Mostly it 's about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we do n't care an iota about - if that 's your thing , tune in . ( * 1/2 )
0 In the first one it was mainly giant rats , but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too . This one , however , is just giant rats period , well giant rats and one really growing little boy . This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats ... you know how it is . This movie has some kills and its moments , but I find it to be on par with the original , I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies . Well , that is not true ... I actually like " Empire of the Ants " , maybe I just do not care for giant rodents . All in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre . I just ca n't recommend this one .
0 This film is really bad , with a script full of ' memorable ' lines and incredibly bad performances . The special effects are also bad ( not the worst ones I have seen , either ) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it . Just two short themes ( 30 seconds long or so ) are repeated constantly throughout the whole film.<br /><br />All in all , one of the worst films I have ever seen .
0 i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago.what a disaster .the acting was atrocious.there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon.this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just did n't ring true.supposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original " Lifeboat".i think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it.from what i was able to suffer through , there is nothing compelling in this movie.it boasts a few semi big names , but they put no effort into their characters.but,you know , to be fair , it was nobody 's fault really.i mean , i'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion . LOL.it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along.but for me , i'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out.so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon , avoid this stinker/ 1/10
0 MABEL AT THE WHEEL is one of those movies with a behind - the - scenes story that 's more interesting than the movie itself . This was Chaplin 's tenth comedy for Keystone during his year of apprenticeship , and his first two - reeler . Here he played one of his last out - and - out villain roles ( although the feature - length TILLIE 'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE was yet to come ) , and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself . In fact , Chaplin 's conflicts with director and co - star Mabel Normand almost got him fired from the studio.<br /><br />Chaplin had n't gotten along with his earlier directors , Henry Lehrman and George Nichols , but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere " girl " was the last straw . Charlie and Mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film . Chaplin was still a newcomer at Keystone and his colleagues did n't know what to make of him , but everyone loved Mabel . Producer Mack Sennett was on the verge of firing Chaplin when he learned that the newcomer 's films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them A.S.A.P. , so Chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way Mabel wanted it.<br /><br />Unfortunately , none of that drama is visible on screen in MABEL AT THE WHEEL , which looks like typical Keystone chaos . The story concerns an auto race in which Mabel 's beau ( Harry McCoy ) is scheduled to compete , but wicked Charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad , and Mabel must take the wheel in his place . For all the racing around , brick hurling and finger - biting the film is frankly short on laughs , but there are a few points of interest . There 's some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence , though there are n't really any gags , just lots of frantic activity . Chaplin himself looks odd , sporting a goat - like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance , MAKING A LIVING , but the outfit suits the old - fashioned villainy he displays throughout . At least it 's novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role . Visible in the stands at the race track are such Keystone stalwarts as Chester Conklin , Edgar Kennedy in a strangely dandified get - up , and a more characteristic Mack Sennett , spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine . As a performer , Sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced , but you have to give the guy credit : he knew what people liked . These films were hugely popular in their day . Mack 's performance does n't add much to MABEL AT THE WHEEL , but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars did n't kill each other .
0 This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise ; but , in my view , begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down . That this well - meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough , but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family 's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories.<br /><br />I found this movie average at best . Art direction could have been much better , as could have been cinematography . The acting was good , and so was Eva van der Gucht 's singing .
0 ' Iedereen Beroemd ' has everything we can expect from a straight to video - movie . It 's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star . The only thing he needs is to get her on stage , surrounded by cameras and reporters . A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail . The problem with the movie is not the basic plot , but how it is made . Everything is supposed to be funny , but it is n't . It is trivial and clumsy , the characters are shallow , and the end - sequence is totally without climax or emotion . The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing , but only at how pathetic the whole set - up is .
0 This was a blind buy used DVD . It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit play.<br /><br />It 's bubble - headed comedy , but it 's um . squalid . The plot is ZANY ! , but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watch.<br /><br />Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven , goofy caper film . ( I know , I know , the quotes on the box & the Academy Award nomination mean nothing . )
0 I saw the film at the Belgrade Film Festival last week , and I 'm still working off the trauma . Essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh , sharp , deep , entertaining and promising . Well acted too . Natural . My problem , however , is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning , nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp , grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken , toothless , bread - chewing hags . It 's rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME ! ! ! The festival brochure synopsis described only the ( utterly intriguing - sounding ) first half hour - a whore , piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar , pretending to be an advertising agent , genetic engineer , and petty government administration official , respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never - ending gum - smacking to come . Serves me right for not reading the reviews , you might say - but to my defense , a number of reviews I looked at post - fact um did n't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film.<br /><br />The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director ( a bashful , tousle - haired Russian youth ) who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium ( the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically , and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening , though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come , judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour , and many exasperated comments on exit ) to say the following : ' Well , I ... um , thank you very much for coming to see this film , and I just wanted to say ... well , it 's a very long film ... it took me four years to make it , and ... it 's .. I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it . It is very long . Thank you for coming . ' This is what he said . Alarm bells should have been ringing . ' What 's he talking about ? ' I thought in happy confusion . ' This is gon na be fun ! ' Of course , by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me , it was far too late to get out . All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again . And in the end I ca n't say I feel in any way improved by the experience . Yes , I absolutely loved the first half hour . It was intelligent , new , and had a lot to say . And yes , Russia is probably in a bad state . Yes , every society has many hidden faces . Yes , toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard . Yes yes yes . I get all of this . Really I do . But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out , and so painful to bear . If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging , try the Korean - Chinese Bin Jip ( 3-Iron ) . It 's artsy and surprising , but also to - the - point and fun .
0 The movie starts quite with an intriguing scene , three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar . All of them are making up a bit outrageous stories . As the movie unfolds , it turns out that the most outrageous story is true . However , beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed . This revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly , not much is left to be seen . The rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies . Sure , these are fascinating and a bit shocking images , but admiring them goes on way too long , sacrificing any possible plot or character development . I found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie - making , where instead of trying to make an interesting story , movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories ( case in point - meat trader 's story ) to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends . On a surface it has artsy appearance , but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent .
0 Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the ' arthouse / festival crap ' trashcan . It 's not the greatest film of 2005 , nor is it complete garbage . It just has a lot of problems . I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ' ideological fears ' , or ' conservative taboos ' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called ' courageous ' and ' uncompromising ' abroad . It was banned because the censors knew 99 % of the Russian film - goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film.<br /><br />So we have a strong opening shot . Wonderful sound design , excellent premise - laden with meaning and symbolism . The usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film 's strongest aspects ( not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge ) . Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup . An amusing and well - written bar conversation among the 3 ( main ? ) characters , and we feel pathos for these people , the great country of Russia , the human condition and all that . Then the movie starts slowing down . We begin to wonder what -yawn- lies ahead.<br /><br />The rest is quite boring , simply put . Sure , the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings , and there are some slightly amusing moments . Nice sound , sure . But the enjoyment of this movie , not to mention the plot , are seriously compromised by the pacing problems . And this , this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the ( nicely - shot ) abject misery and bleakness , is what ultimately will make people angry at the ' offensive ' stuff ( personally , the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing , in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear).<br /><br />If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time ( the entire film ) , watch Particulars of the National Hunt . Much more rewarding post - Soviet stuff . So yeah , a 4 out of 10 for 4 , nice and symbolic of my post - mediocre - film condition .
0 I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie . I guess I must have missed something . The beginning is intriguing , the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories . That 's the best part . After the three go their separate ways , the film splits into three threads . That 's when boredom sets in . Certainly , the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity . Unfortunately , the director beat this one to death , even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular . Bottom line : a two - hour plot - thin listlessness . If you suffer from insomnia , view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep .
0 I 'm starting to think that there 's a conspiracy , all right : one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film , despite its obscurity , will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a " universal acclaim " or something within that range , thus ensuring unsuspecting folk ( like me ) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing , expecting a surprise , only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck.<br /><br />This movie is one of them . It has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article I come across because it 's rather clear that two things might have happened : either I did n't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film 's inner realms as to be impossible to access , or they and I watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name . 4 is a dirty trick on the audience . It 's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say " smorsgabord " and that despite the rating it got on Metacritic , no one had heard of it . It 's terrible with sugar on top.<br /><br />Firstly , there is the ever - present number four from start to finish . While having a little symbolism here and there is okay , and it 's been done with various degrees of success in many well - known movies , this movie is panting with it . Four dogs at the start of the movie , looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly , machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt . Four people in a bar , although one of them is a non - entity . Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless , not only to each other but to what their lives are not . While this concept may work , the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would - be model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre , and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation . Or maybe , like I said before , I just " did n't get it . " The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marina 's story ( which revolves on the death of her sister , from bread - chewing , no less , and the subsequent , shrill mourning which follows ) that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace . So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own ? The director does n't invest much time in truly tying them together , or weaving a tighter story that could , in a David Lynchian way , intersect either with the past - present , or within alternate dimensions , or even as a straightforward , mundane science - fiction story . This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint ( or someone into the weird for weird 's sake ) could endure .
0 The Russian movie , " 4 , " follows the lives of three ( not four ) strangers who meet one night in a local bar . One is a musician , one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl.<br /><br />"4 , " I gather , is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post - Soviet Russia ( the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are ) , but the movie is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it . There seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy Russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities , selling decades - old frozen meat etc . - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could figure out what anybody 's really up to here.<br /><br />Despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes , " 4 " is a two - hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .
0 The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute 's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister / friend . There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken , but they are not fully explored . The core of the movie is the funeral , wake , and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable . Apparently , the movie is unedited . The prostitute 's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud . Maybe that 's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape . The village itself , such as it is , is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male , the consort of the dead girl . Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible . Most of the film is shot with a hand - held camera that could induce nausea . Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do n't include the songs and laments of the crones . Do n't go to this movie unless you 're fluent in Russian .
0 Film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar . OK . They 're talking about their imaginary lives , lying all the time , with no reason . Still OK.From time to time , they even make you laugh . Interesting . First 30 minutes you actually enjoy it ! But then ... things become worse ... Nothing 's happening ... for a long time ... and then , when something happen , all you can see are naked old " ladies " touching each other ! Not OK . Disgusting ! By the way , this part should be the top of the movie , but it 's everything except that ! Movie has no point , it 's boring , and sick ! < br /><br />The strangest thing is that here(Belgrade , Serbia ) on FEST ( film festival ) , this movie was the most popular according to researches , of course , before people watched it ! I even thought(before watching ) : " Hay , this might be interesting , although it 's a Russian movie " ! But , God , No ! ! ! !
0 Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the more ( most!)open - minded movie - viewers ... Movies are my passion , and I am a big regular at my local cult - movie - rental - place ... I also feel the need to add that they often ask ME for advice about movies whenever I get there , and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult - movie - area ... I love to rent strange stuff , and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult - movie - video - place . He told me he thought I had to see this , and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a Jodorowsky(one of my favorites!)atmosphere , I rented it.<br /><br />The vote I gave here is not really fair , because I did not think it was awful , I just did not know how to rate it otherwise . A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /><br />This is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach : I actually felt physically ill ! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned ? Still I did not want to turn it off , or maybe I just could n't because I was fascinated in a nasty way ... <br /><br />I do not ever wanna see this movie again.<br /><br />Not awful , a 1 as I said . Just not my cup of tea(or wodka for that matter ) ...
0 The worst movie I have seen in quite a while . Interesting first half with some engaging , terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late - night bar . The movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock ( read disgust ) without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else.<br /><br />I wanted to walk out , but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect . Still , time is precious ( as the director himself observed in his intro ) and I really begrudge the time I wasted on the second half of this one.<br /><br />Saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie , especially the female lead .
0 The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour . It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good , funny story is to come . Well , I can tell you it will not come . It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness . < br /><br />In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that , according to him , the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience . I was amazed to hear that . Am I living in the same world he lives in ? OK a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all , but that does n't make me feel like I am losing my identity . What does Khrzhanosvky think , that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch ? Am I shortsighted or is he?<br /><br />Well my vote : the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 , a decent 4 is my conclusion .
0 I agree with the previous comment , the beginning of the movie is quite good , and get 's you wandering about what is to come ....... Which is nothing . All open story lines remain open ; two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture , save for 1 or 2 very short scenes . I wander if Ilya would n't have done better to just completely leave them out .... As for the one remaining character , nothing is done with her either . She just visits some god - awful place , and suddenly the movie is n't about her anymore , but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread , drinking homemade vodka , and apparently flashing each other . Some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling , like the judges of the IFFR , but for me it is just bad taste , bad camera - work , a lousy script and frightfully bad direction . Therefor I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading : 1 !
0 As much as I dislike saying ' me too ' in response to other comments - it 's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90.<br /><br />Having been banned somewhere does n't make a film watchable . Just because it does n't resemble a Hollywood product does not make it credible.<br /><br />Worse yet , in addition to no discernible plot ( other than there are lots of muddy places in Russia and many people , even very old women , drink lots of vodka ) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating I 'm in to my second package of Rolaids.<br /><br />As for spoilers - well , the film is so devoid of any narrative thread I could n't write one if I tried.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money , and do n't confuse this with good Russian cinema .
0 this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad ... hence , can i advice anyone to watch it ? well , i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition ( i still ca n't believe it won) .. and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q&a section .. but that was also anything but interesting .. what 's it about ? well the first half ( the worth watching one ) presents three characters : a hooker , a musician and some kind of official .. the first two lie about their professions .. but the third is the actual liar .. the second half ( do something else .. don't ruin a good evening ) includes some old breasts and heavy drinking .. but maybe you will see it completely different ... the tiff jury did ( were they drinking vodka ? )
0 The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb . The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy . One by one , the blood is drained from those involved in the dig.<br /><br />To be as brief as possible , Pharaoh 's Curse is quite the lackluster affair . While the movie does present a few good , original ideas ( blood sucking mummy 's , soul transference , interesting make - up effects , the arm ripping scene , etc . ) and a few atmospheric moments , the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding . To make matters even worse , the first 15 of the film 's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding . I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies , but Pharaoh 's Curse tests even my patients . The cast helps very little . With only one exception ( Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character ) , the cast is as dull as the screenplay . Finally , I do n't know whose idea it was to put the mummy - looking servant in what appears to be pajamas , but it 's a laughable , ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.<br /><br />Despite my mostly negative comments on the Pharaoh 's Curse , I 'm going to rate it a 4/10 . Not a good rating to be sure , but generous given all the problems I have with the movie .
0 * * SPOILERS * * * Slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population , who are at the time revolting against British rule , from finding out about it.<br /><br />Given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors British Capt . Storm , Mark Dana , together with a couple of British soldiers and Mrs. Sylvia Quentin , Diane Brewster , the wife of the head man at the dig Robert Quentin , George N. Neise , make their way to the unearthed mummy 's tomb . On the way there Capt . Storm Sylvia and his men run into this desert - like princess Simira , Ziva Rodann.<br /><br />Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life , she does n't drink water or get tired , but also knows just what Capt . Storm & Co. are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig , Pharaoh 's Ra Ha Tet tomb , as possible.<br /><br />At Ra Ha Tet 's burial chamber Robert Quentin and his crew of archeologist 's together with his Egyptin guide Simira 's brother Numar , Alvaro Guillot , already opened his tomb before Capt . Storm can get there to stop them . Quentin violated Ra Ha Tet 's body by having Dr. Farrady , Guy Prescott , cut his bandages . This action on Robert 's and Dr. Farrady 's part has Numar faint dead in his tracks . It later turns out that Numar somehow was possessed by Ra Ha Tet 's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age , at the rate of 500 years per hour , to become himself a 3,000 year - old mummy.<br /><br />The movie has Numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around Ra Ha Tet 's tomb and it 's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive , like a vampire , of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with . This blood - sucking adventure by Numar , with him later losing his right arm , goes on for some time until the by now crazed Quentin trying to find the entrance , you in fact thought that he already found it , to Ra Ha Tet 's tomb get 's himself killed is an indoor rock slide.<br /><br />We learn at the end of the movie that Numar , to absolutely no one 's surprise , is actually Ra Ha Tet reincarnated into another , some 3,000 years later , person or life . Numar 's sister the mysterious and sexy Simira is not only Ra Ha Tet 's sister , since him and Numar are really one and the same person , but also the Egyptian Cat Goddess Babesti ! Also not that hard to figure out.<br /><br />With Numar / Ra Ha Tet back in his tomb and all the deaths , due the the Pharaoh 's Curse , now at an end Capt . Storm Sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late Robert Quentin 's archaeological expedition trek their way back to Cairo and modern , this in 1902 , civilization . The survivors of Pharaoh Ra Ha Tet Curse keep what they found , and unearthed , only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway .
0 An expedition led by hunky Captain Storm ( Mark Dana ) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition . They meet beautiful mysterious Simira ( Ziva Rodann ) who joins them . They soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what 's going on.<br /><br />A real snoozer . I caught this on late night TV when I was about 10 . It put me to sleep ! Seeing it again all these years later I can see why . It 's slow - moving , the mummy does n't even show up until 40 minutes in ( and this is only 66 minutes long ! ) , the acting ranges from bad ( Dana ) to REAL bad ( George N. Neise ) and there 's no violence or blood to be found . This movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics ( involving a silly love triangle ) than horror.<br /><br />This rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good , everyone plays it straight , there 's some good acting from Diane Brewster , it 's short and the mummy attack scenes ( all three of them ) are n't bad . They 're not scary just mildly creepy . Still , this movie is pretty bad . A sure fire cure for insomnia .
0 I saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless . An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas ? The victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man . They drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or , duh , burn him . Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame , who is unhappy in marriage . Wow , love plot . The rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid . The Egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film . Where is the mummy ? Really just a curse unleashed . This does not hold a torch to Universal Mummy films in the least . Watch this movie if you need sleep , because you will dose off .
0 I would n't say this totally sucked , but if it was n't for Netflix I would n't even have this in my house . Steve Martin 's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat . He 's just not funny . He 's another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie . The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original . Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately . The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes . The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character could n't get pregnant . The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts , but it seems to simple simmer along , not really entertaining or creating laughs .
0 Come on Tina Fey you can do better then this . As soon as the movie started i knew how it would end . Sure it was funny at times . Even laugh out loud funny . But there is n't enough laughs to save this movie . I do n't recommend buying this . At the most i recommend renting it but that s all . Baby Mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for.<br /><br />Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team . Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies . Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did great in that and they do good in this . But this is n't there best . Baby Mama had a great supporting cast . Dane Cook , Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the casts greatness.<br /><br />Another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world . After the great Knocked Up and Juno , Baby Mama looks very average when compared . Knocked Up and Juno are Hilarious , Heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face . Baby Mama 's ending was unfunny and dull.<br /><br />Baby Mama was n't the best comedy of the year and it does n't try to be . I recommend it but do n't expect it to be totally hilarious . Expect a average comedy that does n't give the big emotional ending it tries to have . I give Baby Mama ..... <br /><br />4/10
0 I give this a generous four out of ten stars , or dots or markers , or something.<br /><br />There were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie . All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear ( Greg Kinnear ! ! ) moved along agreeably enough.<br /><br />Otherwise , the usual trafficking in stereotypes , blazing speed , rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack , and " soundtrack " is generous . < br /><br />Anyway , the two really really funny scenes involved Amy P. She 's just really hilarious in an animal kind of way . She 's a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on SNL and Lucille Ball.<br /><br />I hope they ( Amy P and Tina Fey ) just flat out admitted they did this for the money , because if by doing it , it gave birth to the Sarah Palin parodies , then I guess we can say , yeah , it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role , who 's really there to help you be more human.<br /><br />Blah . 4 outta 10 like I said is generous.<br /><br />But no more , girls , OK ? Oh , I almost forgot . The mom from " Two and a Half Men " is in this movie , and she 's had some kind of plastic surgery , so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old , so every scene she 's in , I 'm like trying to rearrange her face , or put it together in my mind , or just answer the question , " No . Wait . Wait . HAS she had plastic surgery ? " Because as a viewer , you really do n't want her to have had plastic surgery .
0 Near the closing stages of Baby Mama , one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it ' was all just a mess ' ; I really could n't say it any better than that . And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again , the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone 's time . A lacklustre cast , mundane script and vague , caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly is n't taxing on the ol' noggin , but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour . Consisting mainly of very routine , cliché jokes based around an odd couple ( rich and poor ) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world , the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic.<br /><br />As a story on finding love , it 's not that bad , but playing this plot line as a side - story of sorts to work alongside the comedy - orientated odd couple tangent , characterisation is notably weak , resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles . As characters themselves , both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces , but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness ; so while we may eventually come to find the character 's interactions with each other amusing at times , the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles ; we do n't feel for the characters and do n't find them inherently interesting , but rather their dynamic . Unfortunately however , although this dynamic works best , or at least better than the individual personas , as mentioned above , it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd - couple formula.<br /><br />Kate ( Tina Fey ) is a successful business woman who has hired working class , dumb - blonde Angie ( Amy Poehler ) to be her unlikely surrogate , and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl ( Dax Shepard ) , both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences . Yes , it 's the typical odd - couple premise , and one that we have already seen in this year 's What Happens in Vegas , yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi - layered characters . Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air . In fact , the movie 's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door - man . Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama , most of those moments were because of this man , and the remainder usually fell to Shepard.<br /><br />It 's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script 's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera , and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough . Yet , for a film about babies , multi - million dollar business and cultural stereotyping , this is n't necessarily a good thing . Baby Mama is grade - A , hammy , plastic tinsel - town with capital bore topped with sugar . So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two - dimensional nature , but I simply did n't care for the world they inhabited . The dialogue , along with sets , costumes , and the script 's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director 's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy ; these are n't characters and that is n't our world in any way   so why should I care ? At the end of the day however , a romantic comedy 's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests , and the frequency of its laughs ; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments . Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair . I 'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings , but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored . In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable , but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience ; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch , Baby Mama is too light - headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward ( http://www.invocus.net )
0 What happened ? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast , but somewhere the movie loses it . Actually , it never really got going . There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant , then find out that she is after all , but that was it . Steve Martin , who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie , was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie , other than to make it longer . I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters , Kate and Angie , and maybe try not for a pure comedy , which unfortunately it was not , but maybe a drama with comedic elements . I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot .
0 For two of the funniest comedians , the movie was awful . Fast forwarded it and never got any better ! Waste of time and waste of money ! Tina Fey is such a great writer , I thought that she would be so great in the comedy . The previews were so great , but they only showed the best parts of the movie . My husband even thought that for a chick flick , it sucked . What is up with that . Movie was very slow ans boring . I will not recommend it to anyone at this time . I would like my money back for this one ! BOO from us here in Arizona . Thanks but no thanks . Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant . I thought that it was going to be so funny , I have had my own children and I have helped others have children . It could have been more along the lines of reality .
0 Come on , let 's get real . The Knights of Christ , Ordo Templi , or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century . The story is so laughable that it 's pathetic . Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored . And besides , if you wanted to have a real - life Templar , why not just use the Knights of Christ , who are still in existence in Portugal . At least they should have taken history into account . The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or Gothic period pieces . The acting was bad , the storyline appalling , the action horrible , and the props were okay .
0 This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER , I emphasize , EVER made . What´s worse , my old hero Dolph is in it and he´s starring it . Jesus ... The story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt . The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter . The actors , except for Dolph who kinda sucks also , perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director , who by the way must have been absent most , if not all , of the time . This is § 12 million spent in an unimaginable way , because by the look of the effects and scenery , the cost can´t be a cent above § 1000 .
0 The Minion is about ... well , a minion . A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped . He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another . Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage . Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas , a member of a secret order of Templars , who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion . The movie begins a thousand years ago , in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion . Then flash forward to 1999 , where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York . An archeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found . Needless to say , the minion is after the key , and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologist.<br /><br />The movie , is just that , a low budget B - movie flick . The movie lacks energy , and just trods along . You 'll follow the chase but you wo n't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies ( especially The Terminator films ) . The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome , in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is . It " skillfully " becomes a one - man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one - on one . And it 's supposed to be around for a long time . All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience . The whole idea of a secret order of Templars , a door to hell , and the key is n't well explained . We are merely to accept that they just exist . The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there 's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks . Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else.<br /><br />The verdict : 2 of 5 stars .
0 Dolph Lundgren stars as a templar who comes to New York when a key that unlocks the anti - Christ is found by an archaeologist , of course the demon is only a couple miles behind Dolph and is n't killed so easily as he transfers from body to body . ( Like Fallen without the suspense ) Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable . I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren , like Steven Seagal and Jean - Claude Van Damme , I try to watch his movies whenever they 're on TV . I caught The Minion and boy was I ever disappointed . This movie is utterly terrible . With action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena . Worst of all is Lundgren 's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest ( ! ) all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of Fallen ( Which was good ) and End Of Days ( Which was bad but better than this ) overall this movie is the worst movie I 've seen from Dolph Lundgren . It literally has nothing to recommend it . It 's awful and it 's the lowest point in Lundgren 's career . And I saw Cover - Up , The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe.<br /><br />1/2 * Out Of 4-(Awful )
0 I ca n't think of much to say about this film . < br /><br />This was an awful movie ... I ca n't even tell you what made me decide to view it . It had SO few redeeming qualities that I do n't even know where to begin.<br /><br />The plot moved from implausible to downright absurd . My entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because I could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done . By the end of the movie , I found myself feeling beyond relieved . < br /><br />The editing was poor , the acting was sub - par , and the storyline was weak . Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American , even though she does not even closely resemble someone of Native American heritage . < br /><br />If a movie is going to be this idiotic , it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least . It was n't . It was just pathetic .
0 This movie had the potential to be really good , considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci - fi actioner THE HIDDEN . And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles . But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one.<br /><br />Dolph plays a butt - kicking monk ( ! ) who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years . He must battle the minion , who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL . The minion , naturally , wants the key so it can let the antichrist out . Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion - possessed bodies.<br /><br />If I 'm making this sound entertaining , forget it . The pacing is very awkward and sluggish , the acting subpar at best , and the fight scenes staged poorly . Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career.<br /><br />The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine - gun wielding monks at the monastery , but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest.<br /><br />Too bad , I really wanted to like this .
0 Where to start ? This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen . The editing is the worst ever , the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked . Most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects , with muddled talking in the background . I had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on .... and what was I supposed to hear exactly ? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made . I ca n't believe people actually put up some green for this film . It makes me think I could take a crap in a box , send it to producers , and then have them finance a movie for me.<br /><br />Dolph , was a usual , Dolph . Nothing else needs to be said . The villains were bad , the protagonists were bad , and the movie was a stinker . If you really want to know what NOT to do when either writing , directing or editing a movie , watch this !
0 Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad . Every time I thought that the movie could n't get worse it proved me wrong . The story was good but the actors could n't carry it off . Also , they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done . For instance you do n't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for . The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl . She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was . The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me . I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff , so that almost seemed depressing . I thought that the characters wern't explained well enough . You did n't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .
0 Maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  Check ! Isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen  Check ! Tasty looking love interest  Check ! Assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy European accents  Check ! German sounding bad guy played by an English actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  Check ! Corny one liners  Check!<br /><br />Deary me , does this film take the wee wee or what ? The clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is!<br /><br />In a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of Die Hard only set on a mountain ( complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid ) we have all the usual action move cliché 's ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off.<br /><br />Jack Wild is the cop in full on John McClane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point.<br /><br />In amidst this mess , there are a few well known recognisable faces who I can only assume needed the cash and/or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects.<br /><br />Looking up this three quid from the Supermarket bargain bin effort on IMDb I am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels , I have got to find these gems on DVD ! It looks like the first sequel is a rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel , well goodness knows ! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with each film and even the character 's name seems to change for the third instalment.<br /><br />Still , blind purchases of cheap DVD 's just would not be the same if studios did n't keep trotting out material of this awful quality ! !
0 It 's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it 's up to one cop , Jack ( Crackerjack ) to stop this.<br /><br />A B - action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action , a ridiculous plot ( as always in these movies ) and three fine stars . Thomas Ian Griffith as the cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists . If you do n't like stupid B - action movies this is not for you .
0 but Thomas Ian Griffith just does n't have the polish that a big bucks actor has , granted this was made 5 + years ago . Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action , but comedy . And how do you get KC out of Katia Koslovska anyhow ? Plummer 's character was so corny , he would have fit better in a Bullwinkle toon . Personally , if action flicks are going to show skin -- I 'd have liked to have seen equal time between female / male , otherwise do n't show any .
0 Dialogue : stilted , clichéd ; Acting : hammy , clichéd ; Plot : predictable , clichéd.<br /><br />Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this " B " rubbish ? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made , Kinski had masterpieces like " Tess " and " Cat People " behind her ... Must have been desperate.<br /><br />The bad guys all have bad - guy accents - * bad * bad - guy accents ! ( Plummer especially ! Where * did * he learn to do " German " ? ) and most of them have bad - guy sneers as well . The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh . The good guy survives , amongst other things : * a 5 " throwing knife buried hilt - deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all ; * marines ' machine - gun fire ( I think someone referred to a .50 ) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp ; * several fist - fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium - first into a door frame ; * a fall , backwards , from what looks like the third floor , onto paving , without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience . The script has exactly 3 clever lines , the rest of the time it 's all so dull and boring.<br /><br />OK it 's not all bad . Plummer does bring a certain class to his part , and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick . Of course that does n't say much , but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here . He delivers his " Ve haff vays and meance " type lines with some menace , but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain.<br /><br />This movie is truly an awful waste of time . The acting , such as it is , is sort of 70 's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee 's very obviously faked fight scenes , but it 's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film . Do n't bother .
0 Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt , with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong , independent lady - flier who 's never been in love . Intriguing early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn , playing an Amelia Earhart - like aviatrix who 's been too self - involved to give herself over to any man . The director ( Dorothy Arzner ) and the screenwriter ( Zoe Akins , who adapted Gilbert Frankau 's book ) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view , but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts ? Billie Burke plays the type of simpering , weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong , and Hepburn 's final scene is another bummer . A curious artifact , but not a classic for Kate - watchers . * * from * * * *
0 The film is about Sir Christopher Strong ( MP -- member of Parliament -- played by Colin Clive ) and his affair with the Amelia Earhart - like character played by Katherine Hepburn . Up until they met , he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating Hepburn , he " could n't help himself " and they fell in love . You can tell , because they stare off into space a lot and talk ENDLESSLY about how painful their unrequited love is . Frankly , this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch . Part of the problem is that in the Pre - Code days , films glamorizing adultery were very common . Plus , even if you accept this morally suspect subject , the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance novel ... and a really bad one at that . Sticky and with difficult to like characters ( after all , Clive 's wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm ) make this one a big waste of time . About the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume Hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume ! You 've got ta see it to believe it -- and she looks like one of the Bugaloos ( an obscure , but fitting reference ) .
0 Yes , I sat through the whole thing , God knows why.<br /><br />It was a long afternoon , I had nothing to do , it was bitterly cold outside , okay , those are all lame excuses but they 're the only ones I have.<br /><br />I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen worse films , but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom -- poor script , poor acting , bad lighting , and cheesy special effects.<br /><br />The storyline , which never completely makes sense , revolves around this simple little family , Daddy , Mommy , and little girl -- that I assume the viewer is supposed to be " identifying " with , all three of them were tedious and annoying . You just want the dark side to get every one of them.<br /><br />Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars . Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the " mysterious " Orient . Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as " The Darkling " . < br /><br />During the course of the film , the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things : a shadow without a person , the inner darkness that exists in all of us , and the Devil . So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy -- because trust me , it does n't really matter.<br /><br />The Darkling 's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion -- it gets a human companion -- and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being . This , of course , leads to immense wealth , followed by disaster , for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.<br /><br />And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long , tedious movie.<br /><br / >
0 The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was in it . Spoilers : About halfway through , F.Murray gets zapped , because The Darkling is some kind of demon - like creature who enjoys living vicariously . He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success . He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins . However , part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil . Otherwise he can not " pervert " their natural goodness . That 's what the little guy said in his Barry White voice , which I found both charming and amusing . Mostly amusing . Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen " Dee Plane , Dee Plane , Bos , Here eet come , Dee Plane ! " All through the movie , Dee Dwarf ( actually a robotronic cherub ) talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice , saying things like " It 's OK to be bad , you know you want it . " " Now you 've committed murder , you 're really moving up in the world " and other remarks that sound like commercials for " Being Evil " Stores or something . It really is hilarious in a sick way.<br /><br />Anyhow , Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham , and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe ( or knifed ? ) . F. Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film . He is a good actor . Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face , and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp . class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about . The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical . If this movie were a parody , the ending was perfect . If it was not a parody , then it was creepy ; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross - out that the movie itself could not deliver . The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending . It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending .
0 First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges . Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired . However , it was n't the Preston Sturges , it was Preston Sturges , Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson 's short story " The Bottle Imp " . A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell . That 's fine . Nobody said screenwriters had to be original . The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen . My biggest complaint comes with the ending . The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person . At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film , they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film . This is a stupid convention . The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end . There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think . You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end . In fact , I think it 's preferable .
0 On the surface , this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation , that is how to become a true self by embracing the so - called ' dark ' side of human nature . Thus , we have the Darkling , a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company ( that is , recognition ) of men , and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled , more or less successfully . < br /><br />However , if we dig a little deeper , we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person : - in the opening scene , the main character ( male car mechanic fallen from grace)is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter , when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl . Lesson # 1 : Cars are persons embodied with immortal souls , and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery . The wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished . - just after that , another character ( Rubin ) buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once - lost - now - found famous race - car and is warned by the salesman . Lesson # 2 : Just like any other person , a car has a unique identity that can not be altered nor replaced . In addition , there is the twist that Rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk , but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of Rubin 's own personal greed for more profit . Lesson # 3 : Thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only , but always as an end in itself . - then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to Rubin and , more importantly , Rubin 's car : The main character 's assessment of the car 's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance , but also by a thorough look inside the engine room . Lesson # 4 : A car is not just to be judged by its looks , it is what is inside that really counts . There is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind , as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell Rubin a fake collector 's car . This scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson # 3 . < br /><br />There are numerous other examples in the movie of the ' car = person'-theme , and I am too tired now to bother citing all of them , but the point remains ( and I guess this is what I 'm really trying to say ) that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do - or , if you 're a car devotee .
0 ... Ok I have read about this film somewhere in the internet , and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was . And I could n't have been more agree about it . Then after that I saw this film on DVD , I was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on TV . Luckily I spared my money for this pieces of crap . I was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film could n't make me satisfy . So I ca n't be judging on how the film was made , but anyway ... it still sucks . As for those who liked this film , I would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is . I do n't know what do YOU think about this film ?
0 I checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page . It is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud .. The only mystery here is how Oscar ® winner F. Murray Abraham got involved with such a lousy script !
0 Maybe it 's the dubbing , or maybe it 's the endless scenes of people crying , moaning or otherwise carrying on , but I found Europa ' 51 to be one of the most overwrought ( and therefore annoying ) films I 've ever seen . The film starts out promisingly if familiarly , as mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son ( Sandro Franchina ) . Whilst mummy and daddy ( bland Alexander Knox ) entertain their guests at a dinner party , the youngster tries to kill himself , setting in motion a life changing series of events that find Bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy . Spurred on by Communist newspaper editor Andrea ( Ettore Giannini ) , she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband , who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles . Bergman plays the saint role to the hilt , echoing her 1948 role as Joan of Arc , and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect . Unfortunately , the script pounds its point home with ham - fisted subtlety , as Andrea and Mom take turns declaiming Marxist and Christian platitudes . By the final tear soaked scene , I had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters . A real step down for Rossellini as he stepped away from neo - realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950 's Flowers of St. Francis .
0 Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to Italy , tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment . First it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI , an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress . And now it 's EUROPA 51 , another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment.<br /><br />Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX , in another thankless role as her long - suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son . At least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI.<br /><br />Bergman is still attractive here , but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman . She 's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son , despite attempts by a kindly male friend . " Sometimes I think I 'm going out of my mind , " she tells her husband . A portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace , but it does give us a sense of where the story is going.<br /><br />Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post - war Rome , but being a social worker with poor children does n't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse.<br /><br />The film 's overall effect is that it 's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like Bergman . The film loses pace midway through the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she 's two - timing him . The story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street - walker through her terminal illness . The final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum.<br /><br />Ingrid suffers nobly through it all ( over - compensating for the loss of her son ) but it 's no use . Not one of her best flicks , to put it mildly.<br /><br />Trivia note : If she wanted neo - realism with mental illness , she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak ! ! It would have done more for her career than EUROPA 51.<br /><br />Summing up : Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman .
0 I argued with myself whether to rent this or not . I 'm always afraid of renting something I 've never heard of ( do n't remember this being in theaters ) . Great cast ... that 's what tipped the scales . 30 minutes in , I almost stopped watching it . The first few minutes are fun to watch , but unbelievable . It only gets worse after that . The writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better . Or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable . I give it a 3 .... a 1 for the writing ( only because there are words)and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script . Oh my god this movie sucks .
0 i guess its possible that I 've seen worse movies , but this one is a real stinker ! the plot is unremarkable but that s not the worst of it . the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching . he 's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together.<br /><br />angie harmon , playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who 's behind the assassination of the president , truly butchered the role . there was no chemistry with gooding , her demeanor was flat and wooden , and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd . this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the " b " list.<br /><br />and what was cuba gooding thinking ? ? ? he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances , but this was far beneath what we 've come to expect from him.<br /><br />poor james woods and burt reynolds . poor poor poor poor poor .
0 Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the U.S. President , i 'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for , and this film shows us why . He teams up with a persistent news reporter ( Angie Harmon ) to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president 's death , and so on , blah , blah , blah.<br /><br />Even with a cast of James Woods , Cuba Gooding Jr , Anne Archer and Angie Harmon ' End Game ' fails to grab your attention , plain and simple ; some of the action is good , the acting is n't all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - WELL IT DOESN'T ! The writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that , at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters.<br /><br />4/10 It 's Boring , Predictable and Dull .
0 I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought , with all the good actors in it , would be worth watching . I could n't believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened ..... I was mad because I could have used that time doing something else .... I tried to figure it all out , but really had no clue . Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it .... right or wrong , it 's better than not knowing anything ! ! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away ? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her ? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth . Does this mean that we 're going to be subjected to End Game 2 ?
0 End Game started well , the least said about the end the better . it seemed like things we 're happening just to keep the plot going , for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive , intelligent person , half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character , we are given no reason for this apart from , the next scene would n't make sense without it . The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes , it would have made an average TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job considering.<br /><br />The end game was honestly one of the worst films I 've ever seen ...... and that 's saying something , I 've seen Gigli .
0 Please , help the economy - spend your money elsewhere ! The synopsis of the movie is : the First Lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her . That 's it . Undetected by anyone , except Cuba and Angie , she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about ... and gets away completely free.<br /><br />Some specific points are particularly hilarious : While standing in front of the president , Cuba a deflects the assassin 's bullet ... which then enters the back of the president 's head.<br /><br />Cuba and Angie watch film from a news camera , and they see ... a clue . They go to great lengths to protect the film , believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film.<br /><br />Cuba speaks with a presidential staff member . The PSM comments that there was no conspiracy . Cuba claims there was more than one person involved . The PSM then rants that the conspiracy includes the FBI , the CIA , and the NSA . Gosh , I wonder is the PSM is involved.<br /><br />Ms Archer , the First Lady , is a craptacular artist . Cuba ca n't make out a painting , and she says , " You 're too close ... stand back ... look from a different perspective , look from my perspective . " Can anyone miss THAT clue ?
0 Predictable , hackneyed & poorly written . Foolishly I reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit . I guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days ( and will only get worse ) that one can not pick and choose much any more . Early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since . The movie lacked intrigue , giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder . Some of the discourse was , frankly , embarrassing ! It 's hard to believe anyone would even consider , let alone commit to , the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe .
0 This movie was craptacular . I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies ' biggest antagonist was , in fact , myself . I played it beautifully throughout ; promising myself I would walk away , but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto - magically transform into something engrossing along the way . Even in this state , I could n't help but notice that Cuba 's acting was as flimsy as tracing paper . His obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards . Burt came on the screen as a General , that 's right , a General ( who wears too much makeup ) . I fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival Cuba 's , except mine was real and I stubbed my toe . Recompense ! Recompense my stubbed toe !
0 Some guy gets whacked . Right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him . He 's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer , but a reporter gets interested . She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked . She walks in , and corners one bodyguard , but he does n't feel like talking . I ca n't figure out why . It 's not like anyone else is interested . She 's the only reporter there . Anyway , her editor discourages her from working on this lame story . But hey , she does anyway . She goes to see the killer 's sister & mom . A few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire . Then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital . She finds him hungover on his boat , but a minute later they 're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them ( and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire ) . The reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them . < br /><br />In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street , there 's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse , some car chases with wreckage & death , a fake suicide , etc . etc . Lotsa stiffs , all kindsa carnage . < br /><br />Great stuff , but what the reporter and the bodyguard ca n't figure is : why in hell the original guy got whacked . What 's the motivation ? Of course , it might help us to figure out why the reporter 's even interested . Through almost all of this she 's the only reporter on the story . Nobody else in the media cares . Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies . True , the original guy who got whacked was n't exactly a celebrity . His job was a little bit dull . He was just the President . Yeah , the one who lives in the White House . Oh , and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent.<br /><br />Is that the spoiler?<br /><br />It should be . After all there are no TV cameras , no other print reporters , no bloggers ... just another one of those police blotter crimes ... <br /><br />So what 's the spoiler?<br /><br />Lemme think ... <br /><br />No ! Wait ! The spoiler is that his wife did it ! Yeah ... the First Lady . She was p --- ed because the President was fooling around . And she gets away with it . She 's really sharp , huh ? But how the hell could anybody ever figure that out ? Why would anyone bother ? After all , only one reporter is even interested . < br /><br />I give this move a " 1 " . It was so dumb I just had to keep watching . And it only got dumber ! That 's the real spoiler ! But even though I 've told you , you 've got to see it to believe it !
0 So I 'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called ' End Game ' . It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller . Well worth a look then . Or so I thought.<br /><br />Boy , was I wrong.<br /><br />End Game has just about the most ridiculous plot I have ever had the displeasure of enduring . Now being something of a whodunnit , I ca n't really tear into it as I would like without ' ruining ' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity . But questions such as ' Why has he / she / they done this ? ' , and ' Where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ? ' are all too abundant following the film 's unintentionally hilarious conclusion.<br /><br />As for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor 's realised that they 've made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie , and this then shows in their performance ? This is one of those . Accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed , irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison.<br /><br />Of course , this did n't make it to the cinema , and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room ; it is appalling .
0 How unfortunate , to have so many of my " a " list , and good " b " list actors agree to do this movie , but they did , and that is what sucked me into watching it . I had never heard of this movie , but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover , and James Woods in the background how bad can it be ? In a word Very ! This movie starts o.k . has some twists and turns , then just lays an egg . The ending was so weak , it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending . How ironic a for a movie titled " The end game " to have such a poor one . These are the types of movies that can move " a " list actors to the " b " list in hurry . I hope Cuba Gooding JR , and James Woods do n't make a habit of this .
0 SPOILERS AHEAD < br /><br />This is one of the worst movies ever made - it 's that simple . There is not one redeeming quality about this movie . The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat . Instead , you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization . The lake was ridiculous , looked like an aquarium , and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed . Characters show their advanced teleportation powers , for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake ( drunk ) , and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position . Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate , made worse by the space - time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader . An example of this would be when she said , " Flashlight ! " in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half . Finally , the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen . It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists . An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alex 's car . I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie . The ending was absolutely pathetic . The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say , " oh yeah ! " Instead , we 're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line . Unfortunately , there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap.<br /><br />I give this a .5 out of 10 , the .5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book .
0 I did n't expect a movie as good as " In The Line of Fire " or an episode of " 24 " , but it looked like this movie was made for TV and did a mediocre job at best . The ( good ) cast could n't disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle ( they really try their best I think ) through their lines of bad script , giving their rather flat characters any extras . When I watched the movie I got the feeling that I had seen most of this in other ( better ) movies . In it you had car chases , big shootouts , romance , plot twists etc . etc ; This movie has none.<br /><br / > * * Spoiler * * As soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to Cuba 's character , you know who 's behind all this and all the hints you 're being given ( " you stand too close to the president , see it from my perspective .. " ) sound silly . < br /><br />If it were up to me ( and maybe it 's a good thing that it is n't ) I would rewrite the plot like this:<br /><br />First lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time .
0 This movie looked good - good cast , evergreen topic and an explosive opening . It went downhill from there . Why was it filmed by hand held camera ? It shakes , judders , part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer . A poor choice indeed . As if this was not enough , the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all . And then it commits the worst sin of all . After leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion , they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive ? How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending ? Doh ! This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud . What a waste of effort . Poor effort by writer and director .
0 I rented End Game , having never heard of it , but I 'm fond of political thrillers so I thought I 'd give it a shot . After doing some research on the movie , I found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release , but instead had gone strait to DVD . After seeing it , I 'm thinking , " no wonder . " The movie is shocking in its unoriginality . The plot and the characters are perfunctory . I figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball . I have to say , I did n't expect it to end quite the way it did , but that 's not a point in its favor . The more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad . Perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist -- even one that made the movie even worse.<br /><br />Stay away . I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back .
0 Camera work - Why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy ? This is annoying and distracting . Editing - the Flashes of the still pictures were way too short . Many of the other scenes were too short also . Just flashes . Sound - the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices . One should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said . Does n't anybody check these things and make them do it over again . Please reduce the volume of the background music in future . Is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor , Julia Wong ? The plot had way too many loose ends . The basic story line had potential . I think the film needed more work . Was it rushed ? Perhaps they ran out of money . Like a lot of movies , it started out great but just petered out toward the end . I really do n't understand this , you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why does n't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard.<br /><br />Sorry to be so critical .
0 You have to figure that when the star 's name is listed wrong in the opening credits , you are not in for a good time ( the credit reads " Cuba Gooding , J.R. " ) . Some nice car chase , shoot 'em up , blow 'em up action if ALL you want is action , because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best , and completely unbelievable . The motivations of the characters , especially that of Gooding 's at the end , are worse then unbelievable , they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled . All I can think is that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project ( he ca n't have something on all of them , can he ? ) .
0 This ranks as one of the worst movies I 've seen in years . Besides Cuba and Angie , the acting is actually embarrassing . Was n't Archer once a decent actress ? What happened to her ? The action is decent but completely implausible . The make up is so bad it 's worth mentioning . I mean , who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film . Someone should tell the make up artist , and the DOP that you 're not supposed to actually see it . The ending is a massive disappointment - along the lines of " and then they realized it was all a dream" < br /><br />Don't waste your time or your money . You 're better off just staring into space for 2 hours .
0 This movie was like a bad indie with A - list talent . The plot was silly , all the way to the end . It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980 's . I would have given it a one , but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile . I think the worst thing was the underwater scene 's held off of the dock . The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were , and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air , this air tank would kind of appear . I would avoid this , unless there is nothing else on the shelf . Good Day .
0 It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance . The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it . The production was good ; however , the script and acting were B - movie quality . The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors . The good actors did n't hold their own nor did they lift up the others . < br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words , but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines . James Wood and Cuba Gooding , Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies . < br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment , I still would n't recommend this movie .
0 MST 3000 should do this movie . It is the worst acted movie I have ever seen . First of all , you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash . There is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job . Also , the head of security for the POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot . This movie sucked . I can not express the extremite that this movie was . Every single actor was terrible . Even the chick at the trailer park . I crap on this garbage . What a waste of time .
0 Flat characters that you do not and never will care about . Cringe - inducing dialogue at places . No twists ( they think they have one , but if you did n't figure it out after about 40mins you 're not too bright ) . Lots of well know actors in roles and performances that , fortunately for everyone involved , will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll.<br /><br />I do n't mind ' slow ' movies , but they 've got to be going _ somewhere_. This one doesn't.<br /><br />The plot was n't what made this a direct - to - DVD movie , that 's just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy.<br /><br />The as - of - writing 37 ( ! ) ten ( 10 ) ratings must be from people involved with the production .
0 An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting , if only you could bring yourself to care . This " twisting and turning " I speak of refers not to the story ( which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole ) but to the director 's inability to keep the characters ' faces even remotely centered in the frame . On the other hand , Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear.<br /><br />The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it . When you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all - star cast , you might be inclined to think something stinks.<br /><br />And indeed , it does .
0 This Movie had some great actors in it ! Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act . I was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start . It actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time . Maybe it was the Musical score or the Director himself , but one thing is for sure the Make - up artist needs to get another job ! The Facial Powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces ! Would not recommend this movie to anyone , no wonder it never hit the Theaters . Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all . The Plot was great just needed a whole lot more .
0 Do n't get fooled with all the big names like Burt Reynolds , James Woods and Anne Archer . They are just glorified extra 's . Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so . Whatever their motives for being in this movie , if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of him . To me this is a sign of bad direction through and through . The plot itself was n't that bad . And the acting from most of the actors was above average . Cuba Gooding Jr. however was terrible . He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes . And since this was meant as a serious movie that ca n't be a good thing . The action scenes were not bad , but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting . Again better direction was needed . Also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this . It took the main character almost half an hour to get in action . For an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow . The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon . She does her best to make it all work . Too bad the director left her hanging . Yes , this movie could have been much better with a great director . Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off . And for an action / stunt coordinator of his caliber you 'd expect at least more exciting action scenes . Do n't waste your time with this one . Avoid !
0 I am a big 1930 's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that s new for me . So I gave this a shot , after all it 's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian . I have watched much less of Lloyd 's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I 'm a much bigger Chaplin fan . Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I did n't finish it . I can understand why his sound career was so limited , he did n't get very good material to work with . After you 've seen Chaplin , Abbott and Costello , The Three Stooges , Martin and Lewis , The Marx Brothers , and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs ( or violence in general ) , this one is very forgettable . I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me . Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film ( at least it seemed that way ) is before he gets in a ring . I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wo nt be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time , 4 out of 10 . Do n't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again , very flat . For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend " Kelly The Second " made a few years earlier , another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase . These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel .
0 About three minutes into this thing I started fast - forwarding , pausing only during the nudity ( why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women ? ) . In ten minutes I was done , and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store . The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA . Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy 's remote control ! That 's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire ! Also , to add insult to injury , the " twist " at the end was so formulaic , that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years . Burt Reynolds was fine , but he should concentrate on real movies.<br /><br />This movie is just a waste of time - Run away ! Run away !
0 A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non - heroes plan to sell to " the Iranians . " Low - rent video nonsense by the producers of " Silk Stalkings " offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged " drama" ... a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects , although the final twists and allegiance shifts could 've been a nifty end to a better movie . Burt still has presence , although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half - baked " one - liners " .
0 The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between . But the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable . < br /><br />But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie .Her voice was so seducing and sexy . The scenes in the bed involving Krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do . Krista really is one of the best in such roles . She also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes , which is the interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star . He could have chosen a better script than this . Ireally think he did for money .
0 I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan , but sorry , this one really stinks . Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie . I ca n't believe he even made this one . Is he actually that hard up for money ?
0 It 's " The F.B.I. " starring Reed Hadley , with an all - star guest cast ! The film begins with an accidental ( convenient ? ) kidnapping , which leads to one thing , and another - which does n't really indicate the main story , which is a " Big House , U.S.A. " prison break story . The story is very improbable , to say the least . It 's like a TV show , only more " violent " ( for the times).<br /><br />BUT - the cast is a trip ! Picture this : Ralph Meeker is sent to prison ; his cell - mates are the following criminals : Broderick Crawford , Lon Chaney Jr. , Charles Bronson ( reading a " Muscle " magazine ! ) , and William Talman ( reading a " Detective " magazine ! ) . Honest ! You should know that , an early scene reveals what happens to the " missing " boy , answering the ending " voiceover . " If you do n't want to have that hanging , do n't miss the opening scenes between the " Iceman " and the boy ( Peter Votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic ) . < br /><br / > * * * Big House , U.S.A.

0 I pity people calling kamal hassan ' ulaganaayakan ' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood ! comeon guys .. this movie is a thriller without thrill .. <br /><br />come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />technically good but style over substance kamal does n't look like a police officer , there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie.<br /><br />kamal at his best is the best in tollywood
0 Filmatography : Excellent , nice camera angles ( I do n't remember seeing a movie of late , with good close - ups , until this one ) . Could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera . NY is pictured good . I liked the upside down angles , in particular ( a different touch).<br /><br />Music : Not impressive . Songs do n't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie . May be , I expected same quality like " Anniyan " . A disappointment . < br /><br />Actors : Kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard - core action sequences . His age and belly really show up . Also , he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward . It was a very awkward to see a mature / aged star still trying to play like a 20 + heroes scenes . Love can be expressed at any age ; as we get older , you still can express love nicely from a distance ( without touching a woman too much . For example , the love expressed by Rajinikanth in " chandrmukhi").<br /><br />Jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie . Not sure why she accepted this . Well , that is not my problem , I guess.<br /><br />Others just have a small presence.<br /><br />Direction : I expected Gautham to excel ( or measure - up ) to his other movie " Kakka Kakka " . He disappointmented me . It took a long time to release the movie due to various issues . He slips in few scenes . Even abvious things got slipped from a famous director.<br /><br />Overall : Just a okay movie . Too much graphics . DEFINITELY not for kids ( and adults who expect some kind of " Entertainment").<br /><br />Thx
0 On the way back from IMC6 ( San Jose , California ) , all five ( mind you , three of us hardcore Kamal fans ) of us had reached a unanimous verdict ; VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday . Not to mention , we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year.<br /><br />I wo n't blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan ( on Vijay TV ) . He said something like , " Tamizh Cinema'la Photography , Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay , Direction , Acting'la innum namba munnera'la " ( Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing , but we have hardly improved , when it comes to Screenplay , Direction and Acting " ) . While you 're watching VV , those words ring very true.<br /><br />Now , here are the 10 Reasons to hate this movie:<br /><br />1 . Harris Jeyaraj < br /><br />2 . Harris Jeyaraj < br /><br />3 . Harris Jeyaraj I 'm barely holding myself from using expletives here , but fact is HJ has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his ( remember ' Anniyan ' , ' Ghajini ' ) with the jarring cacophony , he bills as background music . The next time I have an eardrum transplant , he 's paying for it . < br /><br />4 . Songs Neither do the songs help move the movie 's narration spatially / temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice . The film feels like it 's made of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them.<br /><br />5 . A Short gone too far . VV at best is fit to be a short story , not a 2 hour plus " thriller " . To use a cliché here , like the Energizer bunny it goes on and on and on ; only in this case you do n't want it to . The later part of a movie feels like a big drag.<br /><br />6 . Kamal - Jothika pairing Two ice cubes rubbed together could 've produced more sparks than this lead pairing . There 's no reason you would root for them to make it together . In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie , they make a good irritant to the narration . Hate to say this , but Kamalini Mukerjhee 's 10 minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus ' Thenali'.<br /><br />7 . Kamal Haasan 's accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US ; and it is n't new either . He 's been doing it since ' Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae ' . It 's simply gets on the nerve . Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the US . He does n't leave it at the Immigration either , he offers doses of advice to his men ( bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor , Sathoor and beyond ) in chaste Kamanglish ( " Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok " ) , of course with nauseating effect.<br /><br />8 . Logic There are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale . Gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense . Which D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after ! The scene inside the theatre was so bad , towards the climax ; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the Hero 's IQ . " Is he stupid , ca n't he just use his Siren or Lights ? " ( On a busy Madras road , Kamal - the - cop - on - a - police - Jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude ! ) . " Ca n't he just use his gun ? " ( " The guy on a bike " starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time ) . I 'm not voting in favour of the later , but I 'm just trying to explain the mood inside.<br /><br />9 . Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped , their throats getting slashed , more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity , I would sit at home and rather watch a " Police Report " or " Kuttram " . The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story , not overwhelm it ! Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extensions ( rapes , murders ) are and what the mainstay ( story ) is!<br /><br />10 . Even a double shot Espresso could n't get the pain out of the head .
0 I had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations ; basically because of Kamal Hassan . He is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever . But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen . After watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better . < br /><br />The Protagonist , Raghavan , is a very daring police officer . Who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders . Raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers , two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students , behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree . Finally Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives.<br /><br />THese two psycho - killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters . The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly , which the movie could have survived without . < br /><br />To even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty . The director , Gautham , should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience . Certainly i am never going to the movies looking like Gautham 's name on the production list .
0 What can I say . A Kamal Hassan movie being horrible . He acts very well , but it is a horrible story , along with horrible direction . In my kind opinion , the director Gautham Menon must give up directing . There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie . Apart from that , one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes . There was no practicality in the movie . Gautham is just running out of stories . But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika act really well . The villains look too ugly , though their performance was not bad . I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa which you can see with the family . You will not get sleep seeing this movie ! ! However , Harris Jayaraj again did a great job , and that is why I have given this movie 4 out of 10 . His song ' Partha Modail Nallae ' is soulful and soothing . Apart from that , great cinematography . On the whole , this is just a bad , bad movie . Kamal Hassan , I think , should have rejected this movie .
0 This is quite possibly the most retarded 80 's slasher ever realized , but how can you be harsh on a film that features non - stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises , taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits ? Prior to being a horror film , " Aerobicide " is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids , silicons and other body - stimulating fitness products . If you 'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80 's tunes , there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left . Plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health - freaks with a big safety pin ( yeah  ) . The film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun - bathing device . Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa . You do n't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there 's a link between the murders and the burning incident , now do you ? Investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer ( and Charles Napier look - alike ! ) and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80 's beauty I 've ever seen ! Looking through the credits , her name 's Dianne Copeland apparently , and she did n't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile Troma - movie called " Surf Nazis Must Die " . What a wasted opportunity ! She may not have been a great actress , but she sure had two other BIG advantages that would help her move upwards in show business . The amount of gore and the quality of the make - up effects are nothing special , neither . We 're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh . The plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable , but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore , anyway . " Aerobicide " ( a.k.a . " Killer Workout " ) is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night , but nevertheless feel like watching a film ! It actually would make a terrific double - feature with " Death Spa " . Both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes   and both films are pretty dumb .
0 Big hair , big boobs , bad music and a giant safety pin ....... these are the words to best describe this terrible movie . I love cheesy horror movies and i 've seen hundreds .. but this had got to be on of the worst ever made . The plot is paper thin and ridiculous , the acting is an abomination , the script is completely laughable(the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is - it 's just so damn terribly written ) , the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures , the hair is big , lots of boobs bounce , men wear those cut tee - shirts that show off their stomachs(sickening that men actually wore them ! ! ) and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again ... in almost every scene there is trashy music , boobs and paramedics taking away bodies .... and the gym still does n't close for bereavement ! ! All joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80 's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then .
0 One two three four five six seven eight and back , haha . This is a must see , first of all to see the work out . There are a lot of work out shown , see those close ups , man you will enjoy it . A few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie . It 's a slasher but without suspense . The ending is funny too , and the clothes she 's wearing in the wood confronting the copper , Jesus , looks like a clown . The killings are mostly done off screen , the blood flows but never too gory . There are a lot of fight scene 's too , and hey , no one got hurt . And what about the weapon to kill , never seen a big one like that , wo n't spoil it , you must see it . And being a slasher there 's a lot of T&A too . To guess who 's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that 's the best part , but what about the story of the copper in the woods , huh ! But still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have . I 'm glad that I have my copy , one of those slasher failures . But man , those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles ! If you are in your 40 's then this is one is back to memory lane .
0 You know Jason , you know Freddy , and you know Leatherface . Now , get ready for : The Safety Pin Killer ! That 's right , in Killer Workout , a dumb slasher movie if I 've ever seen one , the unseen murderer dispatches his ( or her ? ) victims with an oversized , novelty safety pin . It is an odd choice to be sure , the kind of thing that deserves an explanation . Naturally , the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing.<br /><br />As the title suggests , an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect . In fact , the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer , just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed . And since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead , it 's really just process of elimination . < br /><br />Oddly , while the entire name cast is killed off , the aerobics classes continue in earnest . In fact , nothing is capable of stopping the dancing . While three men are murdered in the next room , the workout goes on . Death is n't even a factor ; one character dies , but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions . Director David Prior knew what he was doing when named the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout.<br /><br />Cop chases , explosive tanning beds , and hundreds of shots of women 's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure . Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed , I felt very uncomfortable by the end of Killer Workout . Finally , thankfully , THE END flashed on the screen . What happened next ? You got it , shots of the women working out . Not even the end of the movie can stop them!<br /><br / >
0 Want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work ? Just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman 's club . That 's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end . This is the worst slasher film I have ever seen , but every time I was ready to switch the channel , they 'd add another scene with the workout girls and I 'd stay put . As a slasher film , Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of . As a showcase for beautiful girls working out , it is a success . Strong recommendation to avoid , unless the thought of half the film being a big T&A show appeals to you .
0 This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I 've ever seen . And that 's saying a lot , considering I 've seen such stinkers like Demon of Paradise , Lovers ' Lane , and Bloody Murder ( which is a close second ) . However , I love bad horror movies , and as you can tell from my username , this one really sticks out . At times there 's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick . As for this film , the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever , especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film . The acting is nonexistent , and most of the camera shot are of women 's areas shrink wrapped in spandex . The policeman was the most stone - faced , monotone actor I 've ever seen . The best / worst part of this movie , however , has to be the murder weapon . A giant safety pin ? ! What were they thinking ? Who 's the killer ? A disgruntled " Huggies " employee ? I 'd have to give this movie an overall zero , but darned if I did n't have a blast watching it
0 Johnny Weissmuller 's final film as ' King of the Jungle ' , after 16 years in the role , TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS , is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans . At 44 , the ex - Olympian , one of Hollywood 's most active ' party animals ' , was long past the slim athleticism of his youth , and looked tired ( although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry , TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS).<br /><br />Not only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role ; Johnny Sheffield , the quintessential ' Boy ' , had grown to manhood ( he was a strapping 17-year old ) , so he was written out of the script , under the pretext of being ' away at school ' . Brenda Joyce , at 35 , was appearing in her fourth of five films as ' Jane ' ( she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan , in 1949 's TARZAN 'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN ) and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever.<br /><br />Produced by Sol Lesser , at RKO , on a minuscule budget , the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico . While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa , veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively , incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story.<br /><br />When a young island girl ( Tyrone Power 's future bride , Linda Christian ) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan , he learns that a local high priest ( George Zucco , one of filmdom 's most enduring villains ) had virtually enslaved the local population , threatening retribution from a living ' God ' if they do n't do his bidding . The girl had been chosen to become the ' God 's ' bride , so she fled . Faster than you can say ' Is this a dumb plot or WHAT ? ' , the girl is kidnapped by the priest 's henchmen and returned to the island , and Tarzan , followed by Jane , colorful Spanish character ' Benjy ' ( charmingly played by John Laurenz , who sings several tunes ) , and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest ( poor Cheeta is left behind ) . After a series of discoveries ( the ' God ' is simply a con man in an Aztec mask , working with the priest in milking the island 's rich pearl beds ) , a bit of brawling action , and comic relief and songs by Benjy , everything reaches the expected happy conclusion.<br /><br />Remarkably , TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer , Dimitri Tiomkin , and is far better than what you 'd expect from this ' B ' movie ! < br /><br />While the film would provide a less - than - auspicious end to Weissmuller 's time in Tarzan 's loincloth ( he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim , a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man , in khakis ) , the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been.<br /><br />Tarzan was about to get a make over , and become much sexier ...
0 The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one . There are a few things that derail this film.<br /><br />First , Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals . In my opinion , any footwear on Tarzan , whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed , takes away from the character , which is supposed to be anti - civilization and pro - jungle.<br /><br />Second , the character of Benji , as mentioned in a previous post , totally derails the movie as the comic foil . To me , his character is unnecessary to the film 's plot.<br /><br />Also , while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan , it 's apparent that he was not in his best shape . Although in his later Jungle Jim movies , his physique had improved somewhat from this film.<br /><br />The octopus battle is a terrific idea , but I think it should have been done in an earlier Weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak . Likewise , the battle , which takes only 30 seconds tops , would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate.<br /><br />And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye , it does n't manage to salvage this last Weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run .
0 The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller ( looking surprisingly aged a year after " Tarzan and the Huntress " ) is bad , in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better . It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller , shooting in beautiful scenery in México , with a top star of that country ( Andrea Palma ) and multiple award - winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa , and bringing in prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score . Although it may have cost less for filming abroad , it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series , taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania , and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu ( especially the exterior , built on steep rocks . ) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director , instead of Robert Florey , who gives it a very slow pace . Neumann had done a fine work with " Tarzan and the Amazons " , " Tarzan and the Leopard Woman " and " Tarzan and the Huntress " , and finished his career directing the classic " The Fly " the year before his death ; while Florey became a television director , after a career of few remarkable films . If Weissmuller looks tired , the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others , but the worst character is Benji , an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs ( that have a Caribbean air , in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in México ! ) Boring and decidedly of dubious taste , it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller 's Tarzan .
0 Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing too , as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years . No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people , who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride . She finds Tarzan and Jane , who try to protect her . George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but is n't used to his full advantage . Also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player / singer who goes into song every so often . Even the " great " Robert Florey ca n't aid this one.<br /><br />*1/2 ( of four )
0 I 'd never seen a Tarzan movie before so when I saw it on the tele I thought I 'd give it a shot . Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed . Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight . Not how I 'd imagined Tarzan would look . And , unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea , Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell . Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine.<br /><br />Oh well , so much for expectations . Anyway , Jane was there - The monkey Cheeta was there . There was some guy with a guitar there . There were villains and good guys and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable . Nothing bad , you understand , but equally nothing good.<br /><br />Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan : 4/10
0 Well , here we have yet another role reversal movie . There were many worth watching , despite the tired plot of gender reversal . However , this one is not . In previous reviews , I think I 've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for Haim movies that followed the late 80s . This is one of them.<br /><br />'Just One of the Girls ' is about a high school kid ( Corey Haim ) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school . He joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader , Marie ( Nicole Eggert ) . Obviously , he ca n't keep up the charade for too much longer.<br /><br />I thought this movie was utter crap , and it was n't even funny . But , judging by a majority of reviews , it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen , Nicole Eggert , are the only ones who 'd want to watch this . If you 're looking for a good Haim feature ( or role switching comedy ) , look no further than 1989 . This is about the point that Haim 's career tanked .
0 Usually I 'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens ... but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through . Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically . Corey Haim 's performance was abysmal as usual , Nicole Eggert was not much better . This has no redeeming qualities , even if you are a number # 1 fan of an actor / actress in this piece of trash - stay away !

They ca n't have paid you that much.<br /><br />As for Jimmy Nail . Well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an ' actor ' as he is a singer and writer . Come on Jimmy , the joke 's over . ' Crocodile Shoes ' and ' Spender ' were very funny , unfortunately I do n't think they were supposed to be . With ' Auf Wiedersehen Pet ' the opposite applies .
0 Excruciatingly slow - paced , over - scripted black comedy with a too - clever premise and bad acting.<br /><br />Maybe this would have worked as a Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt episode , but by the last half , you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already .
0 From it 's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances , Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout . The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantino 's name is attached to it , and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez / Tarantino flick ' From Dusk till Dawn ' . These things do not make a great movie , however , and this is more than evident all the way through ' Curdled ' . The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas , and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing . The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool , but it 's becomes annoying very quickly ; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican , it does n't fit with the tone of the movie . The film 's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who , because of her obsession with grisly murders , takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes . It sounds boring and it is.<br /><br />William Baldwin is the only ' name ' on the cast list , and even he does n't make an impression . He has n't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing , he 's pretty much wasted . Angela Jones , or rather ; the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction , takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman , and it is always clear that it 's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role , not her acting ability . She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino 's masterpiece , but she does n't have the talent to lead a film by herself . She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film , and if it were n't for her Latino accent ; she would n't convince the audience that she 's a weirdo on any level . Curdled is a one hundred percent - proof piece of forgettable trash . Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics ; but this one fails on all levels . Whether you 're a Tarantino fan , William Baldwin fan , horror fan or just a movie buff ; this is one to miss .
0 Thoughtless , ignorant , ill - conceived , career - killing ( where is the talented Angela Jones now ? ) , deeply unfunny garbage . It 's no wonder Reb Braddock has n't directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules , based on his own script , with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself , and creates something like THIS , anyone who feels that THIS was a story worth telling to the world , does n't deserve a second break . Under the circumstances , the performances are good - the actors do what they 're told to do , and they do it well . It 's just that they should n't have done it in the first place . < br /><br />0 out of 4 .
0 Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold . This is most definitely plastic , all the way . Its easy to see that without Quentin 's involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years , that 's assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place . It is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes , Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role , William Baldwin is better as the Serial Killer who keeps Jones in employment!. All in all pretty poor .
0 I do regret that I have bought this series . I expected more action , more objective picture and more consistency . This is just a pure propaganda series , very dark , without any charm , or romanticism , it is just boredom itself . I find the actors work quite weak as well . O'Donnell might seem charming as Robin ( with Batman ) , but in this picture he lacks any charm . Probably while he becomes older , he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up . It comes as no surprise , that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40 % of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands .
0 I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved . Unfortunately my hopes were dashed ! Yet again we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inept morons who do n't have a clue what they are doing . At one point there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB agents could n't handle one CIA agent . I grow weary of these biased , one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the Spy game that went on during the cold war . I find it laughable that the US is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond . Just like the pathetic U-571 , where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma machine , again , utterly false.<br /><br />To its credit , " The Company " is very well filmed and acted . The locales are also exceptionally well realised . Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as does Keaton ( The conflict between them is very well done ) . I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other 2 episodes but I really wish that US productions would stop trying to portray their Spies , servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet . It gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10/10.<br /><br />S
0 There is a remark that one of heroines was raped on " drunken rampage " by Russian soldiers , which is completely untrue . This movie should not be shown only because of this.<br /><br />Also there is a statement by someone , that KGB prosecuted " Jews , Gypsies etc " , which is " worse than Nazis " . KGB was looking for so called " zionist " agents , who were ( KGB believed ) imperialist agents . This is totally different from targeting Jewry as a whole nation , as Nazis did . Gypsies were never prosecuted . KGB was political tool and used politically , but from internationalist standpoint . Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities.<br /><br />Whole movie stinks like fake . Main hero does not speak Russian , signs in Berlin contains typographical errors , KGB general looks totally phony . Some so called " russian proverbs " are totally made up , and list goes on and on.<br /><br />Not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies , and phony stuff . Go to " Good shepherd " instead .
0 Writer / Director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA . He says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks . The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time , and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film.<br /><br />Unfortunately Sibrel 's research is so slipshod that he does n't realize his " backstage " footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast ( also on that reel ) that was seen by millions , not hidden away in NASA vaults as he implies . And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts ' audio in the footage , because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera , not faking footage.<br /><br />Finally , anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy Sibrel 's hacked - up version of it . ( He shows you more of the Zapruder film of JFK 's assassination than of his " smoking gun " . ) Sibrel thinks he 's the only one who 's seen it . What 's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use , such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth , destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway Earth.<br /><br />As with most films of this type , Sibrel relies on innuendo , inexpert assumption , misleading commentary , and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence .
0 I watched this video at a friend 's house . I 'm glad I did not waste money buying this one . The video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One . The movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow - ups , most not related to manned flight . Sibrel 's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast . He edits in his own voice - over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say . The video curiously ends with a showing of the Zapruder film . His claims about radiation , shielding , star photography , and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against NASA , the astronauts , or American in general . His science is bad , and so is this video .
0 There are so many incorrect statements in this so - called " documentary " that I found myself shouting at the television.<br /><br />Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD , but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims.<br /><br />He relies on either being inaccurate , not telling the full story , or the old favourite " government always lies to us " innuendos , and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims.<br /><br />What 's more , his " exclusive " or " unreleased " footage is freely available over the internet from various sites.<br /><br />Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews , and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions.<br /><br />All of the claims made by Mr Sibrel about " inaccuracies " , " mistakes " , or " whistleblowing " in the Apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven.<br /><br />How do I get that 40-odd minutes of my life back ?
0 The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11 , and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.<br /><br />This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the " whole Earth " picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.<br /><br />I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA , though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map , and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.<br /><br />Ah , a response : " Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I 'd say is a charming , but weak and gullible argument . What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie ? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels . Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here ? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U.S. government that the moon - missions were a success , and that man now are true masters of the universe . Things are nearly never quite what they seem .. Just watch the movie , and I dear say you 'll see things a bit different than before." < br /><br />First off , weather data does n't come from NASA , it comes for met agencies around the world . Second , the weather data undermines a major claim in the film . Third , far from being " packed with irrefutable evidence " , the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked . Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film , so he edited it and added his own interpretation . Unfortunately for him , his source film is public domain , and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims .
0 When I was 16 I saw the documentary : " A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon " . I actually liked , and believed in it for a couple of years . But then I grew up , and began to think , and when I had sought more information . This is : more info from reel sources , and non - biased sources . When I started at university , not so long ago , i asked an assistant - professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories . What he said shocked me : He said that all those theories where lies . That baffled me , I did not believe it first , but then he presented evidence for his claims . He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject : " humans did not go to the moon " . The most outrages claim was that the Apollo - craft could not travel through the Van - Allen - radiation - Belt , without the crew perishing from radiation . The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum - anti - radiation - alloy . It is not that well - known . And the exact specifications are a secret . And why is it a secret : Well , why should they reveal it back then ? ? If they where in a space race with the Russians , then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation.<br /><br />And then there is the biggest evidence of all : The Moon Stones . When the Apollo - missions DID go to the moon , they brought back many rocks from the moon , to give to geologists and similar scientists , who are documenting all things about the moon . These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON . Because : the internal basic elements , which all matter consist of , are also made of special isotopes , that are different from quarry to quarry , land to land , and especially planet from planet . The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved , that they do not come from earth . The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram 's of these rocks , all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth , and from the same planet . Ergo : The moon - landings where not fake . NASA did go to another planet : the moon , though it is not a planet , but a satellite to a planet , a moon ( duuh ) . These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world . It has been proved : Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact , pronto.<br /><br />But I do not worry : most conspiracy - theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated , that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts . The fact remains : Humans did walk on the moon .
0 The only reason I did n't score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film . It is a technically adept film.<br /><br />That having been said , this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven . Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program , rather than actual fact . And Sibrel 's " irrefutable proof " that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics.<br /><br />I do not recommend watching this , but if you do , see it at google video for free . Do n't let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity .
0 This so - called " documentary " tries to tell that USA faked the moon - landing . Year right.<br /><br />All those who have actually studied the case knows different.<br /><br />First of all : there is definitely proof . When the astronauts was on the moon , they brought back MANY pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies . These where spread around the world to hundreds of labs , who tested them . And they all concluded that they came from the same planet , not earth : because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth , but similar to those calculated to be on the moon . I.E. the conspiracy theorists never studies anything : they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest.<br /><br />Another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing , I.E. the flag moves . There is a logical explanation : the astronaut moved it with his hand , so it moved . And what proves this : well , if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage , they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut have let it be , I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad - scientists , they ca nt study a subject properly , or only studies it until they have what they came for , so that they can make a lie from that , and make a profit ( I.E. this so - called " documentary").<br /><br />A claim says that it ca nt possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places , because there are different light - sources , the artificial lighting from the studio . Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong ( as usual ) , the same would happen in an earth desert at night , with no light - sources . But i doubt that any Conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a Star Treck - convention is held over.<br /><br />The Conspiracy theorists are in denial , BIG TIME . They only see what they want to see . So they make up all these lies to seem important - that is a fact .
0 I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings ( 1969 - 1972 ) , or not old enough to appreciate them . I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.<br /><br />I was a youngster at the time of Apollo , but I was old enough to understand what was going on . The entire world followed the moon landings . Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch . Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings - on each day , from launch to landing , from moonwalks to moon liftoff , all the way to splashdown , in a multitude of languages . In school , some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV . During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate . You could n't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was . The world was truly one community . < br /><br />Now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact , it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down . We are left with our history books , and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to " prove " it with a bunch of lies and made - up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise -- not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days .
0 this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any REAL evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case would n't there be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts they spent 30 Min 's there not the 90 Min 's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray.<br /><br />seriously do some research learn what really happened do n't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
0 I am a 11th grader at my high school . In my Current World Affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch . So we did . I am firm believer that we went to the moon , being that my father works for NASA . Even though I think this movie is the biggest piece of crap I have ever watched , the guy who created it has some serious balls . First of all did he have to show JFK getting shot ? And how dare he use all those biblical quotes . The only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates , which is good b / c in my class we have weekly debates . This movie did nothing to change my mind . I think he and Michael Moore should be working together and make another movie . Michael Moore next movie could be called " A Funny Thing Happened on Spetember 11th " or " A Funny thing happened on the way to the white house " .
0 In an otherwise good review , loleralacartelort7890 says " The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum - anti - radiation - alloy . It is not that well - known . And the exact specifications are a secret . And why is it a secret : Well , why should they reveal it back then ? ? If they where in a space race with the Russians , then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation . " This is completely incorrect . There is ( and was ) no " secret " to radiation protection in Apollo . The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available . It uses a lightweight " honeycomb " of aluminum and stainless steel . The entire outer surface ( except the windows of course ) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin , thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re - entry . These materials are actually * better * at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space ( charged particles ) than lead , which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X - rays and gamma rays.<br /><br />Space radiation is a definite problem for * long term * space flight because of the risk of big solar flares . But it simply was n't a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts . The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief ( 1/2 hour or so ) passage through the Van Allen belts . They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received : no more than 1.5 rem , and usually much less . Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon ( 12 of whom landed ) , 18 are still alive . Only two have died from cancer : Alan Shepard ( leukemia ) and Jack Swigert ( bone cancer ) . The rest died from heart attacks , pancreatitis ( Roosa ) , and a motorcycle accident ( Conrad ) . These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s ( Shepard would be 86 ) .
0 Lame , lame , lame ! ! ! A 90-minute cringe - fest that 's 89 minutes too long . A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility ( an abandoned convent ) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky , witless dialogue that 's straining oh - so - hard to be hip . Mostly it 's just embarrassing , and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat ( a sample of this movie 's dialogue : after demonstrating her artillery , fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeau 's vigilante character  she : ` any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck ) . Bad acting , idiotic , homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects , it looks like the director 's watched ` The Evil Dead ' way too many times . < br /><br />I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they 'll never get back . What a turd .
0 This film is so much of a rip - off of the masterpeice " demons " and that s the only thing that makes the movie worth watching . The acting is terrible , the action scenes are speeded up , the script is almost painful and budget non existent.<br /><br />If you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film , skip this and get a copy of the movie demons .
0 This movie is BAD ! It 's basically an overdone copy of Michael Jackson 's Thriller video , only worse ! The special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint , freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling . I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie .
0 What the hell of a D - Movie was that ? Bad acting , bad special effects and the worst dialogues / storyline i ever came across . The only cool thing here was Coolio , who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop . However , the rest of the film is awful and boring . It 's not even so bad , you can laugh about it . Just plain crap . And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones ( well , ok , at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider ) ! 1 out of 10
0 Saw this ' film ' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making I have ever had the misfortune to see . What the Hell was going on with Coolio ? Totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress . Totally uninvolving , slow , tedious and detached . Worse than Spawn . long live " Evil dead II " .
0 I just finished a marathon of this series , and it became agonising to watch as it progressed . From the fictionalising of the historical elements , to O'Herlihy 's awful accent in later episodes , the show just slumps the further it goes . If you are looking for some low quality production generalised WW2 fluff , then I could recommend season 1 , but avoid anything after that , it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera , with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility.<br /><br />The old B&W film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it , and even that is not what one could hope for .
0 Many people thought that this is a good movie but I do n't agree with them . At the beginning of the movie , a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship , then hey killed some people on the earth , but for no reason . Also , it is in a dark forest , I ca n't see anything on the screen , I can only hardly hear the sound.<br /><br />After a few days , the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that , he should not know what happened on the earth , so there is a contradiction . Finally , the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason . He was not live on earth , t is none of his business about the things happened here . Lastly , the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long , the summary is too short and it ca n't tell the reviewers about the story clearly.<br /><br />In conclusion , I do n't think this is a good movie .
0 Here 's an indie film I really wanted to like , but ultimately could not . The lack of script ( boldly proclaimed in the main titles ) really shows through and kills the picture . The story is a nonsensical mess that is n't worth trying to figure out . I quickly became bored within 10 minutes , then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes -- hoping for the best -- before hitting the chapter stops to ( mercifully ) get to the end ... even that was n't worth the extra effort . OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever , lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX . As a result , there 's very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has n't been done before , and better . This film would have been much more fun as a 10 - 20 minute short , but as a feature , it just feels padded and forced . Of course , there 's no money in shorts , so I completely understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 + minutes . Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise , and I wish him luck .
0 I had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel ... so invariably my expectations were crushed . But they were crushed more than should be expected . The movie would have been a decent movie if I had not read the novel beforehand , which perhaps ruined it for me.<br /><br />In any event , for some reason they changed the labor camp at Toulon to a ship full of galley slaves . The scene at Bishop Myriel 's was fine . In fact , other than the galleys , things survived up until the dismissal of Fantine . Because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman , she does not cut her hair , sell her teeth , or become a prostitute . The worst she does is run into the mayor 's office and spit on his face . Bamatabois is entirely eliminated . Because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about , Tholomyes is Fantine 's dead husband , rather than an irresponsible dandy . Valjean is able to fetch Cosette for Fantine before the Champmathieu affair , so they reunite happily , yet another change . Then comes the convent , which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up . Thankfully , it was saved . After this three minutes of accuracy , however , the movie again begins to hurtle towards Classic Novel Butchering.<br /><br />As Cosette and Valjean are riding through the park , they come across Marius giving a speech at a meeting . About prison reform . When he comes to hand out fliers to Valjean and Cosette , he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the TV set . " We are n't revolutionaries . " I could hear Victor Hugo thrashing in his grave . OF COURSE THEY ARE REVOLUTIONARIES ! They want to revolt against the pseudo - monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic , you dumb screenwriters ! It 's a historical FACT that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 . < br /><br />At one point Cosette goes to give Marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets Eponine . Except ... not Eponine . Or at least not the Eponine of the book . This Eponine appears to be a well - to - do secretary girl working for the prison reformers ( who are working out of the Cafe Universal as opposed to the Cafe Musain ) . Not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not - period , low - cut , tight - fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms.<br /><br />The prison reformers ( Lead by the most poorly cast Enjolras that I have EVER seen ) decide that handing out pamphlets is n't good enough anymore . So they 're going to build barricades . I do n't know about you , but I have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops . About three hundred people ( it was not supposed to be so many ) start attacking the National Guard and building a bunch of barricades , etc . Eponine does die for Marius , thankfully . < br /><br />The rest of the movie is sort of accurate , except that Javert 's suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation . The movie ends with Valjean watching Javert jump into the river . This is again inaccurate because Valjean would never have let Javert drown . He saved the man 's life earlier , why let him die now ? Then there 's the whole skipping of Valjean 's confession to Marius , his deterioration , and his redemption on his deathbed with Marius and Cosette by his side.<br /><br />Overall , I can blame the script mostly for the problems . While I am glad Enjolras and Eponine were at least present in the film , they were terribly misinterpreted , as was the entire barricade scene . The elimination of Fantine 's suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her . That Cosette knows Valjean 's past from the start messes with the plot a good deal . I did not even see Thenardier , and Mme . Thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time . The same with Gavroche . I did like Frederich March 's interpretation of Valjean a lot , however , which was one of the redeeming features of the movie . On the other hand , Charles Laughton , for all his great acting in other movies , seems to have missed the mark with Javert . The lip tremble , the unnecessary shouting , and his acting in general all just felt very wrong . He also , like many Javerts I have seen , did not appear at all menacing , something required of the character.<br /><br />Again , this film would probably feel much better if I had not read the book . I would not recommend it to book purists , though . I would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate French version come out the year before .
0 Bill ( Buddy Rogers ) is sent to New York by his uncle ( Richard Tucker ) to experience life before he inherits $ 25million . His uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui ( Kathryn Crawford ) , Maxine ( Josephine Dunn ) and Pauline ( Carole Lombard ) to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold - diggers . One such lady Cleo ( Geneva Mitchell ) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women . We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York , while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman . At the end , love is in the air for Bill and one other ............. < br /><br />The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film . The story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice . Rogers is n't that good either . He 's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone . There is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver ( Roscoe Karns ) and the film is just dull .
0 A friend of mine lent this video to me and I was fairly excited to watch it , but after ten minutes of James Hetfield 's slow pitched vocals and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I began to think , ` Why am I watching this ? ' That question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit Play . I gave the tape back the same day , as you would suspect , not worth buying or watching!<br /><br />Just my opinion!<br /><br / >
0 With a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler , ' The Art of Seduction ' fails to deliver the romantic , sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as . The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead are " swinging singles ( or in the female lead 's case , engaged ) " , but ' The Art of Seduction ' does n't even try . Shirking from a frank examination of these two characters ' personalities , ' The Art of Seduction ' eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin , lean stereotype . < br /><br />'The Art of Seduction ' is insulting - insulting to its characters , insulting to men and women , and insulting to its audiences ' expectations . It takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them . Ji - wan is an immature , spoiled , manipulative bitch . The viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she 's pretty . Min - jun , well , he 's exactly the same . Neither are nice people . The " humour " in this film primarily revolve around Ji - wan and Min - jun 's outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation . No character development occurs , and we never learn why Ji - wan and Min - jun are like this . We are simply expected to take them as they are , and not ask questions - they 're cute ! , and that 's all that matters . The copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester 's reviews may tip you off to ' Art of Seduction 's shallowness . < br /><br />If you 're still in high school , you liked Grease , or you are a yellow fever victim , you may like this movie.<br /><br />Despite its " Romance " tag , this is not a very good date movie .
0 This is a film that makes you say 2 things ... 1 ) I can do much better than this ( acting , writing and directing ) 2 ) this is so bad I must leave a review and warn others ... <br /><br />Looks as if it was shot with my flip video . I have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me . I have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video ; Must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film . One of the worst 3 movies I have ever seen . hopefully the writers and director leave the business . not even talented enough to do commercials ! ! ! ! !
0 Let 's see where to begin ... bad acting ; I 'm not sure if I 'd even call it that , as it more along the lines of a no - effort script read . The actors did n't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless . Sure there was a scene or two with nudity , but that could n't save this movie from it 's lifeless characters.<br /><br />To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do . The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.<br /><br />Budget ? Did this movie even have a budget ? It seemed like they used less money than I 've seen in a home - shot YouTube video . Bad lighting , props , poor sound post production . Bad special effects , if you want to go so far as to call them that . Story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so , but there was no life to this flick ; I do n't care who directed it.<br /><br />I've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom . Do n't waste your time or you 'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review . Check the ratings , you 'll see the 1 's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10 's with hardly anything in between . Wish I would have looked a little closer before wasting my time . What a suck - fest !
0 I love the munna bhai MBBS but " Lagge raho ... " SUX really SUX . I have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life . And these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of Indian cinema viewers ? ? < br /><br />**MAY BE SPOILER * * < br /><br />An educated girl needs an advice from a Bhai , people discussing their personal prob . on phones come on man from which part of the world u r ? ? ? I agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible.<br /><br />2 out of 10 . ( 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting )
0 The reason I intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life ( actually it was only 35 minutes ) was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate Indian cinema . All I have ever seen were few older movies of S.Ray.<br /><br />Browsing through IMDb I came across this one and after seeing rating of 8.7 I concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment . Oh my how wrong I was ! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of 970 people who voted are Indian and their only venture outside Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler movies.<br /><br />With this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on IMDb List of 250 best movies above Citizen Cane , Goodfellas of Psycho ! I am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that I find worth remembering from this painful experience . My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindu who like me find this movie as is -- plain stupid , with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music .
0 LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie . I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u ....................................... <br /><br />This movie really waste yours time and money . I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema - hall ...................................................... <br /><br />Role of CIRCUIT was very small n useless n this movie . I think SANJAY - DUTT cut down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /><br />Character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one .this movie show u the result of OVER - CONFIDENCE ......... < br /><br />The ideas of MAHATMA is also not define and confusing .................. <br /><br />A REALLY VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
0 I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.<br /><br />I watched several documentaries about him . He is obviously an intelligent man , with great knowledge about films and passion for making them , but does this makes him a good director . Definitely NO ! A complete anti - talent . He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits , but a film with actors  never!<br /><br />He ca n't direct nor write . His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations , and many situations / dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they can not be hidden behind the word " art " in any sense . No way . Not to mention the unskillful direction , so amateurish - like . To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.<br /><br />Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store . WHO IS HE KIDDING?<br /><br />He is a cheater ; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want . He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising . Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.<br /><br />Just look at Julio Medem . If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can , then I might re - check his old movies and try to find talent in them .
0 Maybe I 'm missing something because I 've read more positive things about The Man Who Cheated Himself than I have read bad reviews - and I just do n't get it . I like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak , look , and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura . None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it . Take the lead actor , Lee J. Cobb . His rumpled , rolled - out - of - bed look is about as far from the dashing , smooth - talking noir archetype as you 'll find . Or , take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example . This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I 've seen in a while . She 's just not convincing in the role.<br /><br />As for the plot , it 's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre . I could have predicted the outcome of The Man Who Cheated Himself after about five minutes . And that final cat - and - mouse chase scene is plain old dull . Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it .
0 This was a disappointing film for me . It came to me via a boxed set entitled , " Classic Film Noir , " which was a gift from someone who knows I typically enjoy films done in that style ( I insist that noir is a style , not a genre ) . I do not think it is a noir film at all . There seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white B movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir , and the label does not always fit . There is a persecuted male protagonist , Ed Cullen ( Lee J. Cobb ) , and most of the film 's action takes place indoors . Those are just about the only noir elements that I could see . There is no pervasive paranoia , or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen . Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale . I do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers . However , I would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it .
0 This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it . All aspects of the film - script , acting , direction - are mediocre . The acting by the three leads is wooden . I guess John Dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work . Lee J Cobb who is usually terrific can not rise above the poor script and poor direction . Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers . The movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that I have ever seen , the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange . The DVD transfer is typical Alpha .
0 I did n't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this . Only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this . This is supposed to be a horror movie but there 's only filth in this . The most cool scene is the car accident , with real special effects from the best of hollywood . Avoid this movie at all costs . See this only for studies of how bad can be a movie ................
0 Check out the film 's website , more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie . It could n't be more off in it 's boasting . Original story ? Original ? They must have found the script tucked away between the old testament , or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn - tooting . High - end special effects ? Come on , I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax . Stylish cinematography ? Oh yes , the America 's funniest home video look is still a classic . I 'm sure they had little money available for this title , so of course the sf are n't really that good , or a bit bad now and then , or just plain hilarious , but it 's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money . 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen - befores and done - already 's .
0 Now look , I wo n't lie to you , but I only got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth , the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band " Cradle Of Filth " in it . I expected of course violence and gore at its finest , as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as , amongst a plot line.<br /><br />But dear god , I was oh so wrong . This movie seriously bites , big time . Being a low budget film ( haha , wait , make that ZERO BUDGET ) , this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects . Nope , it 's all one camera , bad angles , and bad blood scenes.<br /><br />Take for example when our star and violent fiend , Mr Filth , violently kills a mugger . A grab at the throat , and blood spits out , but oh my , it looks like there 's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man 's shirt.<br /><br />To you Cradle Of Filth fans : You 'll hear two songs throughout the movie , but with the camera angles and shoddy filming , they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN.<br /><br />My final comment : Steer well away from it . It 's blood , gore , breasts , and hey , even a shoddy story to go with it . So if you like appalling violence , near no voices ( yes , there 's hardly any words in this movie ) , then by all means , buy it . But if shoddy movies is n't your thing , then avoid it . Do n't waste your money .
0 This sure is one comedy I 'm not likely to forget for a while.<br /><br />Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie : it 's so minor that no one would watch it anyway , but as it happens , it 's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa , and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.<br /><br />So what is it then ? Well , of course it 's not really a comedy ; instead , it 's intended as a horror flick -- " intended " very much being the key word here . The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess , the special effects are only special in that they 're especially pathetic , and as for the acting , well , let 's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school , my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.<br /><br />Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one 's expectations , certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned . Also , even though I 'm a big fan of the horror genre , I 'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.<br /><br />But still.<br /><br />B - movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding , such as humour . The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances . If you can find the humour in that -- and I could for the first 20 minutes or so , gradually dozing off after that -- then that 's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer . Oh , that and two or three pairs of breasts.<br /><br />Woohoo , how exciting.<br /><br />As for the story , it 's not even that it does n't try to convey anything : the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime . The lesson : Watch out , naughty boys and girls , because one day you 'll be made to pay for what you 've done.<br /><br />I rest my case.<br /><br />So , all in all , a little bit of sex , a fair amount of drugs , but absolutely zero rock ' n roll.<br /><br />I rate this one 1 out of 10 , but would go to 0 if I could . Or perhaps I would n't : it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors ' names correctly in the titles . I mean , that 's something , innit ?
0 Cradle of Fear < br /><br />This is n't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention . This is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack - jacked uttering that sense of whoa . What it is though is a slice of lo - fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination , created in the eyes of the director , Alex Chandon , as " a throwback to sleazy ' 70s and ' 80s horror".<br /><br />This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours , where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood , reams of dismembered body parts and innards , tied by an intestinal thread of revenge . < br /><br />The purveyor of such horrific violence is Dani Filth , lead - singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth , executing a role he was destined to play . < br /><br />As other 's have said , there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge . In this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer , Kemper , the father of our devilish avenging - angel , compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum.<br /><br />What this provides for the Chandon , who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece , is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free . He seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen , and into every nook and cranny that can be reached . We are also treated to close - ups of skull 's being crushed , demonic rape , and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror . And for some of those who closely follow these type of films , there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking , " Did I just see what I thought I did " , because of course Pretty Woman this ' ai nt . It reminds me of some of the gore - fests created out of Italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago , and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed.<br /><br />Story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the " Sick Room " , where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out . Further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent , and an effective use of drum and bass , often overlooked in film - making as a viable form of supporting visuals . Using the city of London as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand - ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film . OK , classic it may not be , but blood , guts , intestines , occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is .
0 ... and you can look at that statement in different ways , by the way . First of all , it 's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes . Your wildest imagination does n't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here . Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick , disgusting , offensive , brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out . Now , I love horror movies and I am very ' pro - violence ' , but I do think that it has to lead somewhere ! ! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts . The " movie " contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story . This results in endless showing of torture , murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common . Not very informative , if you ask me . And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential . It 's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial . Personally , I think that is an interesting topic , so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.<br /><br />Secondly , the whole production of this movie was a mess . They did n't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts ... Tons of it ! ! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I 've ever seen . Any other special effects besides the make - up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash , for example ) . There 's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere ... not even an attempt to build up one.<br /><br />Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least . With the presence of death - metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth .. get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial . Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this . And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing ... Bah . I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you 're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind . For every self - respecting horror fan , this movie is an insult .
0 This film is a very funny film . The violence is bad , the acting is ... Well Dani , stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually - frustrated goth lads in . Personally , i think this movie really does suck . The story and characters COULD be very good , if say the directing , the actors and other little nibby things were made better . But the film is just bad , the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it . This film is possibly the worst B - rate film ever . And , believe me that 's hard to achieve , especially when you 're competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for " serious " horror movies . I 'm not a CoF fan , and so i just see this as another rubbish movie ... A really bad one . If Dani made this as a comedy then , good going him . Very well done . Over than that though , i rate it low , for it 's crappiness . Watch it when you 're in a happy , happy , joy , joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you 're high on multiple different types of drugs .
0 This movie was made for fans of Dani ( and Cradle of Filth ) . I am not one of them . I think he 's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon ( still , I 'm generally not a fan of black metal ) . But as I was carrying this DVD case to pay for it , I convinced myself , that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing . Thus I assumed I 'm in for a roller - coaster ride of rubber gore and do - it - yourself splatter with a sinister background . Now , that is what I do like.<br /><br />I got home and popped it in . My patience lasted 15 minutes . AWFUL camera work and DISGUSTING quality . And that was then ( 2002 ) , that it looked like it was shot using a Hi8 camcorder . I left it on the shelf . Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice setting for this ... picture . < br /><br />After a couple of months I got back to it ( in mentioned surroundings ) and saw half . Then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me . My disliking evolved . I noticed how funny Dani ( 1,65 m ; 5'5 " height ) looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart . ( Yes , ripping . His head apparently had no skull . ) I also found that this movie may have no sense . Still , I have n't finished it yet , so I was n't positive.<br /><br />After a couple more tries I finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back ... ( Yes , it took me 5,5 years . ) So - Dani in fact was funny as Satan / Manson / super - evil - man 's HELPER and the movie DID NOT make sense . See our bad person employs Dani to do bad things . He delivers . Why ? Well I guess he 's just very , very bad . As a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it.<br /><br />We have a couple of short stories joined by Dani 's character . My favourite was about a guy , who STEALS SOMEONE 'S LEG , because he wants to use it as his own . Yeah , exactly . < br /><br />The acting 's ROCK BOTTOM . The CGI is the worst ever . I mean Stinger beats it ( and , boy , is Stinger 's CGI baaaaad ) . The story has no sense . And the quality is ... Let 's just say it is not satisfying . The only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore . Blood and guts are made pretty well . Why , you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on . ( Example - Dani ' The Man ' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it ... and then eats what fell out . Why ? We never know . We do know , however , that this cat must have been on illegal substances , as his heart is almost half his size.)<br /><br />You might think , after my comment that this movie is so bad it 's good , but it 's just bad . Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points . I added one for gore .
0 This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat . Having Dani Filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie . Admittedly , I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it . Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead . The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor . There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie . For being low budget , the special effects were n't bad either . The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish.<br /><br />Now on to the cons . There is VERY little talking throughout this whole movie , thus making for very little as far as character development . It 's hard to fear for the lives of limp , static characters . When there was a little talking , the F bomb was abundant , popping up in random places . Yes , I understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language . The storyline , what I could make out of it , was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what 's happening.<br /><br />In the end , Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence , but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline , it just does n't work too well . Rent it though , if you 're a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite .
0 Normally when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head towards the B - Horror movies . To me the basic principals behind a B - Horror movie is it 's camp value , Heavy Gore , Lots of needless Nudity , and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex . I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I 've been a fan of the band since they released they 're first Demo in 1995 . The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED . When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER . I spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when I was n't laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how a multi - million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi - hundreds of dollars . The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the " Hardcore Goth kids who think death , destruction , sex , blood , and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps . That was really it . To me this movie seemed like 80.5 % of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being Satanic . This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this " Movie " really is just an extended Cradle of Filth Video .
0 By all accounts , this could have been an interesting film . Featuring a score by the mighty Cradle Of Filth , starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as " the future of British horror " , I expected Alex Chandon 's gore fest to live up to the hype.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Everything about this film is either cliche or inept . The short story anthology setup was done to death ( and much better ) in the seventies and eighties . Admittedly , the idea of ' the sick room ' did send a chill down my spine , but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting.<br /><br />Chandon can not write dialogue . Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence ( the typical ' cop on the edge ' formula . funny , i 'm sure i 've seen that somewhere else before ... ) No Chandon , you are not Tarantino . Or Scorsese . It sounds BAD . Add ludicrously OTT acting with very dodgy casting ( do n't get me wrong , Dani Filth is a great singer and musician , but actor he ai n't ) and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing . Give me Bruce Campbell any day.<br /><br />The visual effects are on the whole poor , with some atrocious CGI , awful gore effects ( for goodness sakes , Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget ) and editing filters that shriek OVER - USE ! As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filth 's score ... man , they should sue.<br /><br />The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously , trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience . too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects ( eg : maniac , zombie flesh eaters , the beyond , suspiria etc ) , rendering Cradle of Fear , in my mind , second - rate and obsolete.<br /><br />I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares.<br /><br />Better luck next time .
0 The directors cut version , which was the one I saw , was very long for this type of movie . Almost two hours is way too long . If you have the choice , definitely go for the non - directors cut.<br /><br />The main plot is almost not taken up at all , the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes , which are connected but the feeling is that they 're only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence . The connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before I was there.<br /><br />As a horror movie it does n't work . You never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition ( character is presented , 15 minutes later character is dead ) . This pictures strong side lies in the splatter part .
0 Not since Caligula have I considered turning off the movie half - way through .... but then with this one , I was only 15 minutes in when I considered . Unfortunately , I did make it all the way through . Make sure that you do not.<br /><br />It 's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual . It 's that it 's not any of those things , yet it so desperately wants to be all of them . Instead , it 's boring , trite , ordinary , predictable , and unexceptionally poorly executed ( shot on video , high school special effects , no sense of even basic visual storytelling , dialog barely audible ... not that it 's worth hearing , though).<br /><br />This movie is proof for the argument that even the straight - to - video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere .
0 It SURPRISINGLY had a plot ! ;) I 've seen movies with less plot ( I do n't wanna mention Asian movies but ... ) . I thought the camera was n't bad at all for a cheap movie like this , and also the atmosphere was n't too bad . There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens . Although I do think that about a lot of movies , in this case it was horrible , of course.<br /><br />It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes . The acting was bad but I 've seen worse . The movie was bad but I 've seen worse . Watching this film is an experience between boredom , laughing fits , death wish , sadism , horniness and entertainment on a low level.<br /><br />So if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you.<br /><br />I gave it 3/10 , because it CAN be entertaining if you do n't expect to see a good movie and you 're in the right mood .
0 Sadly , this is not ' the best British gore film since hellraiser ' , though the DVD cover claims this , which is what tricked me into buying it . It is , however , an homage to many of the great horrors of old , films from most notably the Amicus stable.<br /><br />Cradle ... is shot on mini dv , which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie , can be done so much better . Every scene , set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way ( standard key , fill , rear setup ) , which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece . The gore content is , quite frankly , laughable . From the opening shots where we see a man 's obviously foam rubber head torn apart , through to tacky cheap prop hammers , the creature effects and the terrible cg , there was nothing in there that impressed me at all.<br /><br />The acting is abominable , from the near - comatose detective to the brummie dwarf , via Dani Filth , the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have ever witnessed . Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last , and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs . Look out for the ' Mental Asylum ' - a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside , and the most bizarre ( and not in a good way ) padded cell I have seen.<br /><br />It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering ( nay , running ) away at any available opportunity . I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running.<br /><br />It does , however , mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth 's breasts , which I guess is one ( um , two ) things it has going for it . Once that 's out of the way though , it is all downhill.<br /><br />I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon , and I would love to believe them , but on this evidence I 'm not likely to . If you want a decent homage to Amicus , avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead.<br /><br />Currently battling it out with Blair Witch 2 : Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have ever seen .
0 This may have been made for the hell of it , but it was most probably the worst film i 've seen in years , The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case ! ! ! I 'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too , I 'm glad i only rented . I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter , I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future , that is , if he is still in work.<br /><br />Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing , DON'T BUY IT ! ! ! ! !
0 Noting the cast , I recently watched this movie on TCM , hoping for an under - appreciated gem , as I regard many films from the 30 's . This is no gem - not even semi - precious . The anachronistic clothing and 1930 's Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately . The casting is strange , also . But mostly , there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices . This film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise , but the components are n't mixed according to the right recipe . It simply does n't come together like it should . And that 's a shame . WIth a few rather obvious , but minor alterations , this might have been a very good movie.<br /><br />The film is about an American showgirl ( Jean Harlow ) seeking a rich British husband - preferably from the nobility . She meets Franchot Tone and his buddy , who are on a lark in a Rolls Royce owned by his buddy 's employer . Harlow mistakenly assumes Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls , and she sets her sights on him . This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction . < br /><br />However , Tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a German 5th columnist on the eve of WWI , and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart . Tone and Harlow are married , but just as the honeymoon begins , he is gunned down by a Mata Hari - type ( Benita Hume ) , and Harlow flees the scene , with a bystander accusing her of Tone 's murder . ( In fact , Tone recovers from the wounds.)<br /><br />Harlow flees to France , where she falls in love again - this time with a wealthy French cad ( Cary Grant ) . Tone , now in the army , and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in Grant 's hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash . In the following scene , Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold - digger . Harlow never explains about the witness ' accusing her of murder and her panic ! That is one of those unreal , movie - plot - device break - downs in the story.<br /><br />Then Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman ( Hume ) who shot him . She is on hand to watch her paramour , Grant , test the new plane that Tone has delivered to him from England . Incredibly , both Hume and Tone dimly recognize each other , but simply ca n't place where from ! Okay , so Tone was shot and almost died ; perhaps his memory is a little out of whack . But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks ? ( She does not seem to be faking the memory lapse.)<br /><br />This is inexplicable and unnecessary . Hume should have absolutely recognized him , but played it coy when she realized that Tone was n't able to place her . That would have been a much better treatment of that issue.<br /><br />The finale also is very unsatisfying . The movie , as made , has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad , Grant , leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero . Then Harlow and Tone just walk away . It is noble to preserve the French public 's perception of their national war hero , but very unsatisfying as a love story!<br /><br />What the film begs for is this : Harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder ; Tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her ; he then carries a torch for her , even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve Grant 's reputation . Meanwhile , Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad he is . Then having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is , Harlow rekindles feelings for him , too . At film 's end , the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of Grant 's death . After Grant 's hero 's burial , we see them embrace and kiss at the fade - out . That would have made a nice little movie . For Cary Grant fans , it would have been even better had Tone played the French cad who is killed and Grant the long - suffering first husband , reunited with Harlow.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as the Irishman living in England , while Cary Grant is cast as the Frenchman . This movie would have been much better had they reversed roles . That also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been ...
0 It was everything this is n't : it had pace , pop , and actors who were n't afraid to chew the scenery . It also had a decent script . This one had me scratching my head . If Farrah is n't really " serious " about a career , why does she have a manager ( and why is he wasting his time ) ? If Kate and Barney are " artists , " why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows ( like the " Brady Bunch " movie where Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare , only to find himself on BB ) ? They were n't industry names , but they were n't exactly starving , either . And while they got the history right ( the poster was released before Farrah got the show ) , Silverman rejecting pitches for " Funniest Home Videos " and " American Idol " and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday he 'll create a show for her obviously did not happen.<br /><br />What bothered me was how Spelling 's role is distorted . He 's shown as the show - runner and creator when he was neither . And how he " comes up " with the " idea " for CA was is laughable!<br /><br />How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah 's oral contract when the others were signed ? And why did n't Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva , but because Majors wanted her to ? This is why , when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the " bad girl " ( like Suzanne Somers ) , it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the " Three 's Company " pic delivered .
0 I happened to love the show growing up , along with millions of others . So I tuned in to this movie , thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun.<br /><br />WRONG ! I just have to wonder , at the end of this , was Charlie 's Angels really that boring ? I do n't seem to remember it as such . But this movie , as bad as movies of this type can be , bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show . I did see it all , in spite of the negatives , it was n't unwatchable . But it was very bland , which I do not fault the performers for at all , particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them . The movie just was n't that interesting . It tried to make each angel a " character " . ( One angel is to feisty , one is the " good girl " , one is to into her husband .... ),all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes . The excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was .... dialog . That 's pretty much it.<br /><br />Not awful . Not the worst of TV movies . But missable .
0 This was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children 's comic ! I gave it 2 out of 10 for it 's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make - up was good.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies . No interviews with surviving cast members , crew members , production team members etc . , or their friends , families , and any biographers of those people . In fact I know just as much now about the programme as I did before I watched this film that was based on the ( supposedly ) biographical book . As for actually learning something that no - one knew about the program and was n't common knowledge well that never happened .
0 The minute you give an ' art film ' 1/10 , you have people baying for your ignorant , half - ass - ed , artistically retarded blood . I wo n't try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the ' art house cinema ' I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown ' cult classic ' a 10/10 . All I ask is that someone explain to me the point , purpose and message of this film.<br /><br />Here is how I would summarize the film : Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co - incidence . This followed by ( in a nutshell , to save you 3 hours of pain ) the following - A children 's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke - addicted daughter , who he may or may not have raped when she was a child , and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues , while the game - show 's star contestant decides that he does n't want to be a failed child prodigy , a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s , who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for ' corrective oral surgery ' , while the game show 's producer , himself dying of lung cancer , asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago , and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru , even as Mr. Producer 's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man ; and oh , eventually , it rains frogs ( You read correctly ) . And I am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless , literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than , possibly , to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a ' modern epic ' . < br /><br />You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie ( and in turn of not confusing you ) if I had written the damn thing a little more coherently , maybe in a few sentences instead of just one ... Well , now you know how I feel .
0 I ca n't tell you how angry I was after seing this movie . The characters are not the slightest bit interesting , and the plot is non - existant . So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other , hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish , what do we get ? ? ? A storm of frogs . Now yes , I understand the references to the bible ( Exodus ) and the underlying theme , but first of all , it was presented with absolutely no resolution , and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible ( a significant portion of the population ) or Charles Fort ( a still larger portion ) . As a somewhat well read person , I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode.<br /><br />Don't waste your time . It would be better spent reading ... <br /><br /> ... well anything to be honest
0 " Magnolia " is a preposterous , bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little . Like " Eyes Wide Shut , " " Magnolia " is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence . The camera swoops through hallways and corridors , catching glimpses of sad characters . Where is the reason to care for these people ? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot , who ca n't care for others ( except for John C. Reilly 's and Philip Seymour Hoffman 's characters ) , and are self - destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying . I was reminded of how much I disliked " Shine " because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller - Stahl . There are so many unattractive , unappealing characters here , why would we want to spend time with them?<br /><br />Having said that , there is nothing held back about " Magnolia . " Paul Thomas Anderson 's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon . There are two ideas in particular that bomb . Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film . One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann 's coffeehouse folk songs . Sweet , but ineffectual since we ca n't see what strings them all together . The other idea I refer to can not be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.<br /><br />"Magnolia " has a lot of great acting . Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I did n't know he had in him . And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory . But it all adds up to nothing . When the secret unexpected event happened , a girl behind me in the theatre could n't hold it in any more and said , " This is stupid ! " My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree .
0 Great cast . Great acting . Unpredictable story line for the first half < br /><br />hour or so . I was really wanting to know what was going to < br /><br />happen to each of these unredeeming characters , and how their < br /><br />seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined . But when < br /><br />the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players , they < br /><br />mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill < br /><br />for the last two hours . I kept thinking it would get better , but it only < br /><br />got worse . Do n't believe the reviews . This is a waste of time . < br /><br />Think about it -- Tom Cruise made ugly -- why ? The gorgeous < br /><br />hunky bartender wearing braces -- why ? I know it had to do with < br /><br />the plot , but without them , at least there would have been one < br /><br />attractive cast member to remember .
0 Sorry did i miss something ? did i walk out early ? The first ten minutes of unusual ( and untrue ! ) stories had me thinking " This is going to be a classic " But it was all down hill from there ! The acting was brilliant , for what it 's worth William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in . But it never seemed to connect . I was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly .. it rains frog ? ? it was if the writer said " i 've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely .... Oh sod it i 'll just have it raining frogs " . I like clever movies , i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring . 4/10
0 I wanted to like Magnolia . The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon ( which I liked ) . 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost . I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end , little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours . Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre . I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours . The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene . My DVD player still has n't forgiven me and I do n't blame it one bit . It was a unique movie , but a bad , boring , and pointless movie .
0 Normally I do nt have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films , but this one really annoyed me . All they did was swear . For the whole film . ( And , as someone else noted , get cancer ) It was boring , rambling and pretentious . I would nt If I were you . < br /><br />Its also not that I do nt like films which , as most people who like it will claim ' observe life ' . I love Eat Drink Man Woman , and all that happens in that is that a load of Taiwanese people lead their lives . But I could relate to them . I have never met anyone who swore as much as the ' actors ' in this film , and I used to work on a construction site . So go figure . Having said that William H. Macy made me grin . Once . < br /><br />2/10 . Avoid , unless you enjoy tedium .
0 My guess is that this director / writer had something to say . Let 's see , what it could have been ... a. Frog storms would be creepy ? b. can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the " C " word many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter ? c. Cast my wife and get her to say the " F " word every 2 seconds . This aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm . The rest was a relentless , over - long ( under - edited ) , over - indulgent failure . Glad so many of you enjoyed it ! < br /><br / >
0 1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray . First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT . Then they hyped up THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA which is by far the worst movie of the year . What is it about ? Who the heck knows . Its full of self - indulgence and loaded with bad acting . I always like to stay and watch the credits , but when this thing was over I could n't get out of the movie theatre fast enough . Most of the audience that attended the showing that I was at , felt pretty much the same way . Dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers . It 's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful .
0 Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming , shrieking , overwrought , hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret , guilt and pain . PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess.<br /><br />A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent , and they were . I just wish that every scene did n't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused.<br /><br />I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film . The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at . But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display . I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself , but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution . Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament.<br /><br />I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I 'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD . In short , a good movie to look at and listen to ( the music , that is ) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
0 That 's not just my considered verdict on this film , but also on the bulk of what has been written about it . Now do n't get me wrong here either , I 'm not a total philistine , I did n't hate the movie because it was n't enough like ' police academy 9 ' or whatever , I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff , I swear.<br /><br />'Magnolia ' is poor , and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed . Long winded , self indulgent , rambling nonsense from start to finish , there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie . There 's some high calibre actors fair enough , and none turns in an average or worse performance . Furthermore , my wife ( a self confessed Tom Cruise hater ) tells me it 's his career best performance by far . But the plot is so completely unengaging , meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail 's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.<br /><br />It does n't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with ( well I did n't think so , but I do n't like most people admittedly ) . They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length , demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever - so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route . Yadda yadda yadda . The soundtrack 's dire as well , with that marrow - suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.<br /><br />All in all , it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of ' Friends ' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat . The bit with the frogs is good though .
0 This ambitious film suffers most from writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson 's delusions of grandeur . Highly derivative of much better material ( Altman 's " Nashville , " Lumet 's " Network " ) , this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere . A couple of misguided detours along the way ( an embarrassing musical interlude , a biblical plague ) do n't help matters . Neither does the uneven level of performances . Especially bad : William H. Macy , whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether ; Julianne Moore , for her unconvincing angst . And how many times must we see John C. Reilly 's Sad Sack shtick ( " Chicago " and " The Hours " will suffice ) ? Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist , foul - mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing . Speaking of foul mouths , the script was so loaded with " F " bombs , they lost their impact in no time . Do n't even talk about that awful soundtrack , full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann . Her extended rendition of " One , " a maudlin number to begin with , drove me to distraction at the start of the film . I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours , by which time I 'd been pushed to the brink of hell . One redeeming feature , which I have n't seen mentioned in other reviews , is the best performance in the bunch , by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia , the damaged coke fiend bent on self - destruction . Her credibility exceeded all others by far . This film took itself way too seriously and just did n't know when to end .
0 I ca n't say this is the worst film of all time , but only because there are still some movies I have n't seen , yet ! This has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time ! The director suffers from the same issues he had with " There Will Be Blood " ( though he was n't quite as bad in that film . The whole movie it feels like you 're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities . It 's like he sits in his little director 's chair and thinks " how would a great filmmaker handle this scene ? " He just does n't have it in him . I do n't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker . There were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished , but nothing was brought to ripen . The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history . One by one as we see the characters singing , and I squirmed in my seat , I kept saying " please , PLEASE , just do n't have the guy on the brink of death singing , too ! " Sure enough , MASSIVE FAILURE !
0 What made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to Charlotte Bronte 's brilliance of the original classic story . I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie , which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste , had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful . Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters , Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester , seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor . Also missing was Jane Eyre 's charismatic sense of self , which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all . The original Jane Eyre was a hero . The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over , including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester . Her struggle to find food and shelter , her shame at having to beg for bread , the threat of freezing to death in the cold , all to get away from a man she loved were , in my opinion , poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie . The title character seemed dry and uninspired . The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book , I can not imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting . The screenplay and Direction did little if any credit to the classic story .
0 This version is pretty insipid , I 'm afraid . Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood , but William Hurt 's weary , throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored , petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt ! I also ca n't believe that they eliminated Edward 's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book , one of the most moving moments in literature . I do appreciate that they finally used such a young , plain woman to play Jane , a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 , but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel , please see the 70 's version with George C. Scott and Susannah York . York was too old , tall and pretty to play Jane , but no one has touched Rochester 's character the way that Scott did .
0 I do n't like using the word " awful " to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time , effort , talent and money is spent in its creation but Zefferelli 's attempt to adapt Charlotte Brontë 's novel ' Jane Eyre ' is a total waste of time.<br /><br />The script is lacking in finesse and power , everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms , leaving little to the imagination . The lead actors are woefully miscast , clearly hired for their star names , and the musical score drippy and dull . Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all . She is like a wet noodle , worse even than Joan Fontaine , who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion . And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy . Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick.<br /><br />Joan Plowright 's Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out . < br /><br />There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester 's first wife . The role of the would - be second wife , played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson , is an empty cipher.<br /><br />Fiona Shaw , a very great actress , is completely wasted as Jane 's Aunt , Mrs Reed . She would have been better - cast as Mrs Fairfax . Only Amanda Root , as Jane 's beloved school teacher , evokes any authentic sympathy or believability . < br /><br />I saw this version of ' Jane Eyre ' after viewing Robert Young 's for British television , made in 1997 , starring Ciaran Hinds , Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones . There is no comparison . Young 's vital , romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli 's wet squib.<br /><br />I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton , about which I 've read some very good things on this web - site . I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli 's Yorkshire picture book . < br /><br />About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored , beyond that it is a complete dud .
0 Jane Eyre _ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it . I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about . This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book.<br /><br />The whole ' red room ' is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in . In the book the ' red room ' is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane 's life . Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie I 'm sure she was happy to die and leave early . In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head . The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it .
0 I read the novel ' Jane Eyre ' for the first time back in 1986 . It was round that time that I saw the BBC - version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke . It was an excellent version and very much like the book . Years later , I laid eyes on this version and was horrified . William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester . Mr Rochester is a passionate character , where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice . The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough . It was like watching two zombies together . This is story about love and passion , but I could n't see it in this version . No , back to the BBC - version . A wonderful time is guaranteed .
0 What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking ? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty , or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who did n't speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte 's classic ? I do n't think I can improve on a comment I read below , so I 'll just paraphrase it : " Jane Eyre is a great great book , the screenwriter should read it sometime . " It 's true that this movie 's two leads were sadly miscast . But pity the actors , because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes . The dialog that makes you understand the Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun ... deleted from the script . The marriage proposal , the fortune teller ... gone . The allusions , half joking , half sincerely felt , to Jane as a fairy sprite from olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despair ... eliminated.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane 's interactions with the Rivers family . But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 ( ? ) mini series with Timothy Dalton .
0 I agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched , and I would also say rushed . It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school . But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it does n't fully make sense . For example Jane & Mr Rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage ! ! ! The actors do n't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story . The actors are good but are n't given enough time to do this story justice . I 'm sorry to say it but I did n't really enjoy this version . The 1970 version with Susanna York & George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles . I love it so much I watch it regularly . There is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins .
0 Having read the novel before seeing this film , I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot . I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte 's work , and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story . In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours , the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional , thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding . There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre , so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you can not help but imagine their ' love ' is superficial . This is such an injustice to Bronte 's novel;you are given no impression of Jane 's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her , and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him.<br /><br />Despite to poor scripting , I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely , namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole , however overall the production was poor . Given a better scripting , perhaps the film would have been more successful . See " Jane Eyre " ( 1970 ) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production .
0 This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it . So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester . Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel , the three short versions of ' 44 , ' 70 and ' 97 and the three mini series of ' 73 , ' 83 and 2006 , and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.<br /><br />This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned . Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky , of lonely Rochester standing on a rock , and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life . In addition , his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes . As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester , and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse . There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane , each of them beautifully staged , but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other . We know that they are supposed to fall in love , but we never see it actually happen . The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane 's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing , and the farewell scene , the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences . Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Brontë 's superb lines , neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten , but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out . What remains is just a glimpse of the novel , which does no justice to Charlotte Brontë 's masterpiece.<br /><br />The cast is a mixed bag : While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed , Anna Paquin 's young Jane is more an ill - mannered , pout Lolita than a lonely little girl , longing for love . The ever - reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable , but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix , and one can not help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain - looking , hard - working Grace Poole . Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown - up heroine , however , is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre . Looking every bit like 18 , thin and frail , with irregular , strong features , she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role . And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance . Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask . But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane 's character any further . As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues , Gainsbourgh 's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory . This is a pity , as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the ' 83 version.<br /><br />But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane , there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays . Hurt , who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies , must have been aware that he was physically and type - wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel . His Rochester , besides being blond and blue - eyed , is a soft - spoken , well - mannered nobleman , shy and quiet , slightly queer and eccentric , but basically good - natured and mild . He is so far from being irascible , moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous . Additionally , during many moments of the movie , Hurt 's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness . Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open . If you compare his Rochester to the strong - willed and charming protagonist of the novel , simply bursting with energy and temperament , it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt 's performance . Still , he offends me less than the Rochesters in the ' 70 , ' 97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones . Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so , whereas George C. Scott , Ciaràn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could , but failed miserably , and I 'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played . And I 'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today 's couple in a Starbucks café . Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure , but at least it is an inoffensive one , which is more than one can say of the ' 97 and 2006 adaptations . I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation : You will not find Jane Eyre , but at least you will find a beautifully made movie .
0 Oh just what I needed , another movie about 19th century England . Which is pretty much like regular England , only nobody 's vandalising football stadiums . In this picturesque setting of lords , dames and other randomly chosen titles , Charlotte Gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as Jane Eyre , from that novel nobody has ever read willingly . Jane usually hangs out in Mr . Rochester 's crib , where she tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time . One day , Mr . Rochester(William Hurt on auto - pilot)comes back to fall in love with Jane and all that , but there 's still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic . Oops , that was n't in the brochure . After some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire(they probably rented the set),the movie finally comes to an end . Everything looked really authentic , that 's something I guess . But then again , nah .
0 I love the book , " Jane Eyre " and have seen many versions of it . All have their strong points and their faults . However , this was one of the worst I have seen . I did n't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester . Charlotte Gainsbourg ( Jane ) was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part , but she had no emotion in any of her lines . I could n't imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her . < br /><br />That brings us to Mr. Rochester . William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane , if that were possible . How two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery , but it certainly did n't hold my attention . Perhaps the director ( Zeffrelli ) fell asleep during the production.<br /><br />The Timothy Dalton ( too handsome for Mr. Rochester ! ) version is far more faithful to the book , but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A / E version ( which is NOT all that true to the book).<br /><br />Trying to find something positive about this movie : Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role .
0 As a " Jane Eyre " fan I was excited when this movie came out . " At last , " I thought , " someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author . " Wrong ! ! ! If the casting director was intending to cast a " Jane " who was plain he certainly succeeded . However , surely he could have found one who could also act . Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester ? Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere ? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother ? Finally , why was the plot changed at the end ? One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book . What a disappointment
0 The first half of this version was the best I 've seen ( and I think I 've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made ) . The development of Jane 's childhood and character were exceptional . Then , it was as though someone said " Uh oh , this is running too long , " and hacked the rest of the story to shreds . The major scenes , when included at all , are glossed over , combined , and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline . There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow . The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope , and then the end dashed it .
0 What a pathetic movie.<br /><br />I wo n't waste much time commenting about it . I 'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it.<br /><br />Let me leave it simply with - Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer . He is utterly without talent at both discplines . It 's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs.<br /><br />Much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no - talent that is Shaq .
0 This is one of the most god - awful movies ever . Shaq better just stick to basketball . This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back . I will make fun of this movie until I die , and then some . It is so horrible it is not even funny . MST3000 would have a blast with this one .
0 There 's only one thing I need to say about this movie - the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra 's character about wanting to be a genie ; never see this movie . The story is horrible , the acting is terrible ( c'mon , it 's Shaq ! ) and I 'd rather see Capra in Free Willy ( equally horrible ) twice before ever seeing this movie .
0 This is the worst film I have ever seen . I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough . The plot was bad and there was n't a single likeable character . I could get more entertainment watching static . I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale did n't go into negative numbers . Avoid this movie at all costs .
0 i was given the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday , and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie , but this time they were wrong . At least with the movie it 's over soon.<br /><br />The acting in this is terrible , which i expected from a film with Shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster ( which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there ) . The kid in the film that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor . He 's bullied by neighborhood kids , which i do n't blame them because he 's a little douche bag.<br /><br />The story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché . About a boy who 's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father.<br /><br />Even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea . It 's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it 's an embarrassment and should have never been made . i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks , but you should already know just by reading the plot .
0 This movie has successfully proved what we all already know , that professional basket - ball players suck at everything besides playing basket - ball . Especially rapping and acting . I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is . First of all , is it just me , or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen ? I mean , his teeth could be used as a can - opener . Secondly , why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when , even though he has magical powers , he sucks horribly at making music ? Third , I have read the Bible . In no way shape or form did it say that Jesus made genies . Fourth , what was the deal with all the crappy special effects ? I assure you that any acne - addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that . Fifth , why did the ending suck so badly ? And what the hell is a djin ? And finally , whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the Eiffel Tower , because this movie take the word " suck " to an entirely new level .
0 If you are a fan of really bad movies , and you think there funny , you will the great acting of Shaq . First off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works . Shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to Dennis Rodman who also made a few bad movies . Well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid . I would give this a zero but that is impossible .
0 The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1 . I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 . I 've always heard how awful it was . The movie did not disappoint . The best parts were Shaq 's outfits . The worst parts were , well , just about everything else . My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and could n't look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max did n't wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his ! But for all it 's terribleness we just could n't stop watching it , the story sucked you in , like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit , it was hypnotic . But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched " Kazzam " .
0 Reviewing KAZAAM and saying it 's a bad movie is n't hard at all -- after all , critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film -- saying it was among the worst films of the decade ! So the fact that I say it 's bad or anyone else says it 's bad is certainly no surprise . It 's like someone talking about WWII -- practically no one says that was a GOOD thing , right ? ! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is " why did they make this in the first place ? ! " . After all , it 's obvious to anyone who is n't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible . But , movies like ED ( a baseball playing chimp ) , COOL AS ICE ( starring the ever - popular Vanilla Ice ) , TROLL 2 ( which does n't even have any trolls in it ) , BABY GENIUSES ( Einstain - like superhero babies ) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE ( huh ! ? ! ) prove that any idea , no matter how dumb , can make it to the big screen ! So , the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright ' normal ' ! < br /><br />The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school . Like the punk from FREE WILLY , this kid is somehow ' misunderstood ' ( in other words , a total brat ) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is , by the end of the film he 'll have learned something and grown . Just once , I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film ! Eventually , while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him , the genie Kazaam ( Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes . But , the kid does n't believe him AND the genie 's magic seems a tad rusty.<br /><br />Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real . However , unlike most kids , he withholds making his wishes so , in the meantime , Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere -- like his own personal servant . And , according to the cliché , you know that by the end of the film , Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed . Oh , and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom 's fiancé ( I 'm gon na gag ) . Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.<br /><br />As for Kazaam , Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap ... very poorly . I 'm a middle - aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well ! He 's an amazing basketball player and I 've heard he 's a nice guy -- but a rapper ... no way ! As far as his acting goes , he was n't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it 's hard to hate him -- even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.<br /><br />So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you 've probably heard ? through the first two - thirds of the movie , I would have said no . Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script . However , later in the film , the bad becomes horrid -- as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he 's really needed . And , out of nowhere , the plot gets really , really weird -- as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star ( ? ! ? ! ) turns out to be an evil mobster ! And , oddly , this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation ! < br /><br />In addition , the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad . I know that the kid was annoying , but this is supposed to be a kids ' film ! ! What part of ' trying to kill the kid ' did n't the writers not understand ? ! ? Then , in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history , Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug - induced hallucination ! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE ... and boy , did it make my brain hurt ! ! Uggghh -- the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!<br /><br />Overall , it 's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane . Yes , folks , with a messed up message , bizarre non - kid friendly material and horrible characters , this is one wretched film . Sadly , given the idea and actors , it 's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!<br /><br />By the way , if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD , try the British made for TV film " Bernard and the Genie "-- a charming and exceptionally well - written film from start to finish .
0 OK so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary : Genie comes out of ghetto boom box , gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes , the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what , shaq sucks at rapping , and i guess that s it.<br /><br />So mainly I laughed , I cried ...... but mainly I laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh.<br /><br />I'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b / c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes.<br /><br />If I had 3 wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like Hollywood did n't waste money on making this .
0 Let me give a quick summery of the film : A rotten , rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam : a rapping genie . Like all genies , he grants 3 wishes but , being good natured , also helps Max with his personal life , as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime . During all this , Kazaam raps from time to time , ( also showcasing Shaq 's dismal rap skills).<br /><br />This movie proves what we all know : Athletes need to stick to sports . I admit that it never looked like an Oscar - worthy movie , but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible . The characters are either unlikable or stupid , the plot is not even worth mentioning , the dialog is a joke , and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem . Hell , even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke . I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big ( no pun intended ) at the time . I honestly can not think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time . Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws .
0 Now , I 'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews , and say , " Hmm ... this is n't so bad ! " I loved The Cable Guy , and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great . Keep in mind , I really did n't start watching this with high hopes , but I figured that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a kind of way I could laugh at it . I was wrong . At no point at all during my suffering through this " film " ( And I use that term sparingly ) was I even close to being mildly entertained . To start , Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting . I hate rap music , but as far as I could tell , an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him . The main character is simply annoying , and not a character that it 's easy to like . Quite frankly , I would rather eat a greasy turd out of a Harlequin fetus ' bloody sores than watch this again .
0 What was the point of this movie ? What was the plot ? I do not know . Shaq ca n't act , people do n't know how to direct , and I am Kazaam ! A genie who raps ? Come on . Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this . I remember I watched this just to kill time . It did n't really interest me . I just remember thinking , " Who put Shaq in this movie ? ? ? " The whole story seemed stupid too . It made no sense whatsoever . I guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen . I ca n't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there 's nothing worth commenting about . I " wish " this movie would go away .
0 This movie is so , so , so horrible , that it makes angels lose their wings . Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts , like his work in Shaq - Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums , and later , the epic serving of horrible film - making that is Steel.<br /><br />There 's not a single good thing to be said about this movie . I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young , but I must 've been an idiot then , because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart . It 's fun to mock . I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that . Although , once the thrill of mocking it is done , you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness.<br /><br />If you see it on TV , try this : consider , as your watching the film , removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers . If you do that , it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him . That 's kinda funny , and disturbing.<br /><br />A horrible example of film . Do not , unless looking to mock it , see this movie .
0 Yes , Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies , but with humanity . Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie- yes , a RAPPING genie- where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits , all ending in him in a Christ - like pose with lots of light surrounding him . So , yeah , expect really cheesy bits , including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky ( and , regrettably , not knocking out the two main characters , particularly the kid ) . What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O'Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy ! The main plot of the film involves this kid , played in that all - too - typical and annoying - kid fashion by the great - grandson of Frank Capra ( where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily ) , who comes upon a genie who 's been trapped in a boom - box . Then " hiarity ensues " as the kid makes the Shaq - genie his quasi - slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady - gang - type absentee father.<br /><br />This really sappy , contrived son and father story would be bad enough , as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies ( i.e. the " two chances in life " speech from father to son ) . But it 's Shaquille O'Neill who is both the reason to watch the film ( ironically ) , and the obvious sinking crux of it all . His plot line involves him , when not getting the over - talky treatment from Capra , to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career . On top of this , he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom - box . So is there a camp factor to the movie ? Up to a point , but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and ' heart - felt ' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material . One might ask if the people making the movie , who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon , if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing . I 'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid . But I 'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaq - machine.<br /><br />So , if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genie - turned - rapper - turned - wisecracker , all the more fun to you . Hell , it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel . But if you 're hoping to keep a few brain cells , stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 , and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90 's .
0 There was a genie played by Shaq His name was Kazaam , and he was whack His rhymes were corny , this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin , bad casting , bad special effects what s next ? this movie sucks Prolly did n't make 20 bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... <br /><br />Yeah , you get it , a stupid rhyming genie who ca n't act , in a stupid movie with horrible special effects . Oh , and its confusing as hell . I 'm not even gon na go on . Let 's just say , it belongs in the " its so bad , its funny " category . Watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh . But do n't expect anything spectacular .
0 This film proves that the " commercial " cinema , or else , the Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis . There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on Shaquille 's name . There is no worth referring to the plot : it is a bit more perplexed than a knot . What else?The screen is somewhat dim , O'Neal is a bad actor but Francis Capra is even worse.<br /><br />Rating : 1 / 10 .
0 Would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball . This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level . In this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp . He is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra . This movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world , the acting was awful and I think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it .
0 This is quite possibly the worst movie of all time . It stars Shaquille O'Neil and is about a rapping genie . Apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece . The movie gets 1 out of 10 .
0 I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival . Based on a novella by science- fiction author Brian Aldiss , this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe , conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band.<br /><br />Almost deliberately gimmicky , the film is also too clever by half ( if you 'll pardon the pun ) . By mixing genres , styles and moods , the directors ( whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha ) lose their way pretty quickly . I was never sure whether I was meant to take it all seriously or not . Flashbacks , dream sequences , it was all just a bit much . Plus , the promised rock and roll just did n't move me . I was reminded a bit too much at times of Hedwig and the Angry Inch , a film I found original and moving . But in this case , the songs just were n't as good , nor were the main characters sympathetic . A more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine .
0 this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible . as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film , how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago , but then again i saw this video . in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script , one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe , yet this movie lacks them all . you heard me it lacks them all . there is not a single point i like about this movie , none . i hate it . i 'm sure anyone will do so too . the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff , yet it fails even at the nudity . i do n't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so , and i definitely recommend you do n't do so . worst movie i 've seen in my entire life . if someone offers you to watch it , ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
0 Terrible movie . If there is one Turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 , that should be Banyo . What a waste of time . Other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing , nada , zilch , nil . The dialog is cheap , and sexual clichés are all over it . The director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own . The red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do . If you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting . The only good thing I can say about the movie is , wait , wait , there is nothing good I can say about it . I must have really disliked it to write about it this much . Jeez !
0 First of all , I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema , which is because , the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline . This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos , as the director and marketing ads imply . In my mere opinion , the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country ) Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meant.<br /><br />However , the acting is near perfect . In fact , most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked ; talent ! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job , even the less experienced ones . ( Like Janset ) At least , Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast . Other than that , he is just a media monkey , who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . Come on , art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked / half naked women . And just because media boasts off , no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema . Just close your ears and o something real artistic , I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . Hope , this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach.<br /><br />In short ; Pros > Good acting , hot women ( just kidding ! ) :) Cons > Each and every single thing , other than the cast
0 If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar , as it is promised by the tag line , you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of Alt&#305;oklar regarding most famous issues like sex , marriage and cheating . To much nudity , which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that Alt&#305;oklar was unsuccessfully to " try something new " as he has quoted . To much sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt&#305;oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is " sex sells . " I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique . However in the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt&#305;oklar 's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work .
0 And I mean ultra light . This film features four giant stars , about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.<br /><br />There really is n't too much to say about this stinker , other than that although it has a couple of really good bits , most of it is n't very funny . Nor does it work at all as a romance . How about as a romantic comedy ? Not on your life . Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated , much less amusing.<br /><br />What 's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all . This movie could have been so much more , especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted , complete with phony quotes from critics . The film uncovers the un - mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews . But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes , it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film 's lame romance.<br /><br />The same with Catherine Zeta - Jones ' character -- the whinny , self centered movie star . Zeta - Jones does a good job with what she 's given , but she 's given practically nothing . It 's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we 've heard about stars over the years.<br /><br />In the end , it is hard to understand what made Zeta - Jones , Julia Roberts , John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship , which sinks like a rerun of " The Love Boat . " In fact , as the old joke goes , they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal . It would probably make a better story . So , go ahead and tell us , filmmakers , what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this ?
0 Let me put it another way : balls . Or , how about bollo*ks . This is truly awful , more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise . Julia Roberts is a skilled actress , and usually her work is of the highest standard . This movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient . Normally she is the consummate professional , yet I swear that in her eyes , there were signs of bewilderment and despair.<br /><br />The one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director ( Chris Walken ) turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors . Unfortunately , that theme was n't explored to it 's full potential . Too little , too late.<br /><br />Zeta Jones was wooden , Cusack was Cusack , and Crystal should stick to acting . The two talented ex - Buffy stars had different experiences - Green hopelessly mis - cast , and Balfour under - used . Well done to Julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made .
0 How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me . This is a terrible cliché ' ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done . It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would agree to this unfunny film . What 's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states . It does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks , even if the film is terrible . I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore - fest . Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions . Whatever you do , do n't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this .
0 Wow , what a great cast ! Julia Roberts , John Cusack , Christopher Walken , Catherine Zeta - Jones , Hank Azaria ... what 's that ? A script , you say ? Now you 're just being greedy ! Surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary ? You 'd think so , but no . America 's Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another . It 's like everyone involved woke up before each day 's writing / shooting / editing and though " You know what ? I 've been working pretty hard lately , and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names , right ? I 'm just gon na cruise along and let somebody else carry the can . " So much potential , yet so painful to sit through . There is n't a single aspect of this thing that does n't suck . Even Julia 's fat suit is lame .
0 It was disgusting and painful . What a waste of a cast ! I swear , the audience ( 1/2 full ) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes . This is not a lie . Do not even rent it.<br /><br />Zeta Jones was just too mean to be believable.<br /><br />Cusack was OK . Just OK . I felt sorry for him ( the actor ) in case people remember this mess.<br /><br />Roberts was the same as she always is . Charming and sweet , but with no purpose . The " romance " with John was completely unbelievable .
0 I have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it . But this movie was terrible . I have yet to see why people thought it was funny . The idea behind it is stupid . Plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb . Why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me !
0 the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it(the crazy filmdirector)the rest of the movie was just boring.in the first hour or so nothing really happens.jokes which supposed to be funny are n't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck ( yeah right ! ) into the girl next door ( where did i see this before ? ) who gets the guy.for short.i really did n't care what would happen with the main characters.if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch .
0 In fact , it never was . I 'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy . What a vacuous shambles ! None of these people come close to a Cary Grant , Spencer Tracy , Katherine Hepburn , etc , and anyway , today 's audience is n't as receptive to this facile muck . Writing is trivial . The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious . The chemistry between the leading characters is non - existent . It 's interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she 's a reincarnation of some big star from the " golden age of Hollywood " , whenever that may be . It 's an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride .
0 Billy Crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter , but in this movie he and all the rest of them can not bring any smile on my face .... or perhaps just one . They call it comedy , I say it 's a waste of my time .
0 I found this film to be an utter dissapointment . The talent available to the director- notably Stanley Tucci , Chris Walken , Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin ( without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny , mediocre story , whose conclusion one could n't really care about once introduced to the dire , stereo - typed characters . Julia Roberts is feeble , Zeta - Jones is just plain annoying ( appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity , minus the humour ) , Crystal just plays his same old hyper - active , neurotic , annoying alter - ego and Cusack simply walks through his part , apparently bored with the whole project.<br /><br />For what is supposed to be a ' Romantic comedy ' , there is absolutely no romance between the central characters , let alone chemistry , and as for the comedy- ( possible SPOILERS)well , the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusack 's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever . ( Spoilers ) Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse - maverick - Dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead ( Spoilers ) we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog . Pure genius.<br /><br />For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack 's work , not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast , I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas , and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them , instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost ' gross - out , teen - movie ' humour at times.<br /><br />A very poor 4/10 .
0 Characters you do n't care about , relationships you do n't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start . Julia Roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other . She was actually somewhat endearing in this role .
0 Shame on Julia Roberts and John Cusack . They are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie . The storyline was dumb and predictable . The jokes were not funny . The romance was not really romance . I was all too happy when this movie ended .
0 When my wife and I decided to watch this movie we thought it could n't fail . I love Billy Crystal , my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it.<br /><br />We were misled , in spades.<br /><br />On my part , I felt Billy Crystal 's character was extremely one - dimensional and did very little for the film . Sure , he cracked a couple of good jokes , but as a character he did nothing but take up space.<br /><br />And poor Julia Roberts . In past shows she plays well as a strong - willed , self - determined lady . In this flick , she seems completely repressed and had very little fire . This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watching.<br /><br />OK , if I were to find one good thing , it would have to be Christopher Walken . Now that 's entertainment . But , just like Billy Crystal , hardly anything is shown of his character.<br /><br />If you 're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value , go see it . But if you 're looking for a smart , romantic comedy , this is not your film . It 's none of the above .
0 This movie is horrible ! It rivals " Ishtar " in the number of embarrassingly bad moments . I would have rated it lower than a 3 , save for a couple of funny lines ; but , overall , this film was crap ! It looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere . Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the directing sidelines forever !
0 What a stinkeroo this turned out to be ! ! ! At one time , much earlier in her career , Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no great shakes as an Actress , but very beautiful and pleasant ( particularly in films like " The Mark of Zorro " and " Blood and Sand " ) but when I saw this monstrosity , the memories of her golden days faded quickly . The story is unbelievable and farcical , the acting second - rate , the supporting cast insufferable . I can not think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter , and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked . Added to this , was the terrible photography ( and I am not just referring to the color ! ) Everyone associated with this , must have shuddered whenever it was shown .
0 I just watched this horrid thing on TV . Needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get . Frankly , I do n't know how much lower the bar can go . < br /><br />The characters are composed of one lame stereo - type after another , and the obvious attempt at creating another " Bad News Bears " is embarrassing to say the VERY least.<br /><br />I have seen some prized turkeys in my time , but there is no reason to list any of them since this is " Numero Uno".<br /><br />Let me put it to you this way , I watched the Vanilla Ice movie , because it was so bad it was funny . This ... this ... is NOT even that good .
0 The saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes I 'll never get back . I knew this was terrible from the get - go , with the guy dressed as a lunatic Indian chief on top of the roof . ( See if they could get away with that in 2008 ) . My 10-year - old boy is really into baseball right now , so we decided to rent it on a rainy day . Even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it , I had to cringe when I heard all the needless foul language . Bad , bad movie . This was an awful ripoff of Bad News Bears . Completely shameless and completely predictable . I do n't mind a predictable movie if it 's done well , but this one absolutely was not .
0 Have not watched kids films for some years , so I missed " Here Come the Tigers " when it first came out . ( Never even saw " Bad News Bears " even though in the ' 70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie , " Warriors , " " Man Who Would Be King , " and " Rocky Horror Picture Show , " among others . ) Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on . Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things -- at least watching for his / her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting were n't doing the job . Lo and behold , I spied Wes Craven 's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer . He 'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the " Scream " movies . Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic . More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast credits as " Aesop , " a wacky character in the movie . F.J. Lincoln , from the ' 70s to just a few years ago , appeared in and produced adult films . He was associated with the adult spoof " The Ozporns , " and just that title is funnier than all of " Tigers " attempts at humor combined . Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel .
0 Might contain possible spoilers ( Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion ? Sure it 's cheaper for them , but after a while , would n't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off . House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all . Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are : The voices do n't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again ( Since when ? ! ) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films . Even the movie 's musical number ( which had been Disney 's specialty for years ) stunk . I would n't recommend this film to anyone even the very young . All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released , it 's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality .
0 I found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored . How can people possibly give this a 10 ? It 's not just that it 's supposed to be a feel - good redemption film ( I think ) , because it does n't work on that level either . Weak plot , bad dialogue , terrible acting ; there 's just nothing there . Harvey Keitel is decent , but has nothing to work with , and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible . The plot progression ( especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley ) makes no sense . It seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it , without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow . It 's only an hour and a half , but that 's 90 minutes of your life you 'll never get back .
0 This movie makes Canadians and Brits out to be asinine , moronic idiots . The men get stoned / drunk , and then they yell / beat each other up in almost every scene . The women are superfluous to the story  I do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus , or worse , milling around like mesmerized cattle . Apparently , Canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks . It 's the standard knocked - up girlfriend , her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before.<br /><br />Every character here is a carping , infantile stereotype . Not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower ! And the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with George Wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag ! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it  but I can not understand why he would have accepted a role like this . Maybe he needed the money . Ian Tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming moment , but his talent is wasted here.<br /><br />As for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn - or Karl  who is dead , but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind ( almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock 's masterpiece  although I am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films ) , why even bother ? Karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying.<br /><br />By the end of this wretched movie , I thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat !
0 Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC , but easily the worst , never seeing the light of day . The director is not even Canadian , but British , and boy does it show . We are all made out to be a bunch of over - sexed dope fiends and morons . The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent , and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk . Of course the British character is normal . The rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say " Norm ! ! " ? The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes . The actors always seem to be fidgetting . Are they as bored as the viewer , or is this the directors idea of cinema ? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonalds films . A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically . You wo n't be compelled to walk out on HIS films after 10 minutes .
0 Anyone that has see Tammuz 's Child Eaters knows that this is a director that can do better . Let 's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot ( Telefilm anyone?)and that is was a case of second feature jitters . The characters are one dimensional and over used . The scenery is terrific however and showcases the Pacific Northwest beautifully.<br /><br />The cinematography is great . Shot almost entirely outside , the images are crisp and beautiful . You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves.<br /><br />Technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart .
0 A splendid example of how Hollywood could ( and still can ) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up.<br /><br />In the case of " the Big Sky , " writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize - winning author , A.B. Guthrie . In so doing , they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation.<br /><br />The epic nature of Guthrie 's book and the evolution of its main character , Boone Caudill , from a naive , Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor / mountain man , has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author 's intent . In the movie version , Boone 's presence is nothing except underwhelming.<br /><br />Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie 's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever . Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character , who was an incidental , minor character in the book , only occupying a handful of pages . On the other hand , a very important and fascinating character , Dick Summers , the veteran pioneer , is missing altogether ! ! ! It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie , played by actor Hunnicutt , was n't irritating enough . So Zeb / Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious , voice - over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing , editing , and direction.<br /><br />Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based ( William Wyler 's " Ben - Hur " is an excellent example ) . But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself.<br /><br />The story is dull and clichéd , and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie 's literary vision . And unfortunately , Kirk Douglas ' star appeal , which could have helped lift this film , was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given.<br /><br />If you can believe it , the film version of Guthrie 's Pulitzer prize - winning sequel , " The Way West , " also starring Kirk , is even worse.<br /><br />In my opinion , " The Big Sky " further solidifies Howard Hawks ' place as one of the most overrated , tepid directors in the history of cinema .
0 I 'll give writer / director William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill - conceived " thriller . " A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO , let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurbs . A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing significant to their resumes , although the art direction is not half bad . The dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit ; this is storytelling at its worst . No tension , no suspense , no dread , no fear , no empathy , no catharsis , no nothing . A few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom , but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer . I feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing . Good for late - night , zoned - out viewing only . You have been warned .
0 First of all , what is good in the movie ? Some pretty actress ? the exotic background ? the fact that the actors do n't laugh while acting ( I would have if I had been in their situation ) ? I do n't know . The storyline is simple : a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who ( another abstract painter ) killed his little brother , a male prostitute ( raped by another priest when he was young ... ) . I 'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers , art or religion . Dennis Hopper is not very good here . This is the worst episode of the worst season of " profiler " ( the serie ) with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences ( the uncle is the policeman who , the girl who lives at another victim 's house could have a baby with the priest , etc . , etc ) .
0 This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store . Do n't make the same mistake I did . This movie is tedious , unconvincingly acted , and generally boring . The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered ; I cringed at every scene they shared . Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self ; his role was clearly not a stretch for him . And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico , it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot ; all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo - Irish accents . Odd . Anyway , when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store , keep walking .
0 This movie was a mess . It had the absolute worst editing I have ever seen . It was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial , and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream.<br /><br />Under the messy direction and editing , there was a glimmer of something good . A good idea , a compelling spark . But somewhere it went wrong.<br /><br />The story is about a quasi - psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders . The first thing that is hard to bite into is Richard Grieco as a priest . Well the part does n't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well . The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy . He always plays the crazy bad guy . Very ho hum.<br /><br />Oh , a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy , horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character ( Grieco ) was experiencing . And just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords . Not a good sign for any movie.<br /><br / >
0 This " film " is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film . unnecessary slow motion , unnecessary flipping / jumping / somersaults , unnecessary characters , unnecessary dialogue .... basically unnecessity . ( is that a word ? well , it 's just been invented by I , Robot.)<br /><br />What happened to practicality ? ( i.e. the car garage , the skin spray ) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop.<br /><br />What happened to showing respect for women ? ( i.e. smith 's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film , and yet she still " wants " him . WHERE IS THE TENSION ? I 'll tell you where , good looks and not admiration or common ground)<br /><br />What happened to a detective that detects ? Smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself , complaining to other people , and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off . this is such a lame way to get the story from point b - c - d - etc ... it was OK once , but not several times in a row . ( speaking of several times in a row , what was the " I 'm snoring and not listening to you joke ? Twice In One Scene?)<br /><br />What happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes ? Shia LaBeouf ( the kid ) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES , we know that A - he degrades women , and B - he knows Smith ....... so of COURSE we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm,<br /><br />What happened to Hero 's ? let 's just forget that there are people , women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that I have an acquaintance with . and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air , showing off , while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot.<br /><br />don't get me wrong , I 'm all for spectacle . but I 'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning.<br /><br />I have to say I 've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time . so thanks Alex . < br /><br />I pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques , simpler stories and simpler everything else in films ...... but mainly simpler techniques.<br /><br />Big Budget Action films : " you so have to die "
0 In spite of the great future - design touches , the clever Asimov premise , and Will Smith 's dependable cool performance , this movie does n't live up to expectations . The clichés come thick and fast ; ( waking from a recurring nightmare , maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant , to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off ) . This movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere ; what 's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago . The robots themselves are good in closeup , but the ' crowd ' scenes look more like bad Disney -the CGI is overdone again and again . And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them , why do they need to inject ' nanites ' ? You know it 's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax . It could have been great , but it 's less than the sum of its parts , mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years .
0 This is probably the most boring , worse and useless film I have seen last year . The plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix , with plenty of clichés : the lone wolf cop , good looking , psychologically disturbed , sleeping with his gun ... + nice hard worker and shy , but good looking she - scientist , you add a 2 cent plot and you have I , Robot ! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx , Audi , converse etc . This movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec . I would n't recommend this to my worse enemy , if you have some spare time , watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book .
0 I just saw this film on DVD last night , and decided to check out the reviews this morning . It seems that " I , Robot " has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb ( and given rise to a lot of insults and name - calling , too).<br /><br />I find this somewhat surprising , as this film is not great ( or even good ) , but neither is it terrible ( or even really bad ) . What this film really is , is ... depressing . Depressing that the US film - goer population is so ready to lap up insipid , clichéd re - heats , and acclaim them as spectacular new works . This film as " retread " written all over it , from the plot line ( an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern - day uber - action ) to Smith 's character ( a smart - mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium ) , to the special effects ( that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).<br /><br />"I , Robot " is , sadly , quite possibly the perfect action movie for today 's audience : superficial plot , insipidly snappy dialog , and lots and lots of adrenaline . Smith is mediocre , but we already knew that ( he seems to be Hollywood 's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis ) . The story has lots of holes in it , of all sizes , but I do n't think most people drawn to this film are critically - minded enough to notice . Perhaps a blockbuster by today 's standards , but very B - movie compared to true winners .
0 After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie - goers . There are the ones who are well read , extremely literate , and intelligent . They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author . For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature . Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre - pubescent teenagers . Today 's well read fan knows well this history , and knows the great authors Asimov , Heinlein , Bradbury , and Ellison , who helped bring science fiction out of that basement . In doing so they created thought provoking , intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition . This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them . They are not critical for it 's own sake , but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye . ( As they should as Hollywood 's record has been less than stellar . ) To these fans the story must take supreme importance . They can not be fooled by flashy computer graphics , and non stop action sequences . When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest.<br /><br />The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre . ( Look at many of the above comments that state " Well I have n't read the book or anything by this author ... ) Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel . They are extremely uncritical , willing to overlook huge plot holes , weak premises , and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects . They are , in effect , willing to turn off their critical thinking skills ( or maybe they never had them ! ) for the duration of the movie . Case in point , I Robot . While supposedly based on Asimov 's short stories and named after one of his novels , it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations . ( Those of you that will run out and buy I , Robot will be very much surprised - this movie is n't even based on that story at all ! ) < br /><br />The film has enormous plot holes , that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity . I wo n't point them out . I wo n't spoon feed you . You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself . The characters , which are named after many of Asimov 's characters , do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories . The plot itself with all it 's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for . His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds , not their fists , is vital to understanding his vision of the future . In short , other than the name , their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie . There will always be those uncritical ( i.e. unthinking ) who will state : " The movie does n't have to be like the book . Due to the medium , movies sometimes require that changes be made . " But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book ( or books ) from the start ? What if all they took from the written work was the title ? This begs the question : Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it 's title on your vacuous piece of crap ? Save money and do n't buy the rights to the works . Title it something else . Do n't use the character 's names . Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism . In fact it wo n't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him . But it will upset those who read , who think , who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show . < br /><br />I , Robot , like much of Hollywood 's take on the genre , pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago . Hollywood could not do this alone . It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this .
0 I ca n't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction . Forget the product placement disaster , the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot - holes . This was n't only laughable and but painful to watch . Even the action was boring . A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.<br /><br />What a shame that sci - fi this bad can still be made after we 've had Bladerunner , Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City ( by the same director ) . This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list . Truly awful .
0 Waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand , I expected an interesting sci - fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot - technology , instead I went disappointed by each aspect of it , once more proving that stunning special effects ca n't help a boring plot , which by my opinion was the worse in this year . Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me , Will Smith did n't show anything new in this movie , yet I never saw his acting to change since " Men In Black " which was his only success by my opinion . He had to retire since than , not spoiling his name with titles like " I , Robot " and " Men In Black 2 " . 4/10
0 Del - " You are the dumbest smart person I 've ever met." < br /><br />Calvin- " Well , I had a brain , but they lost it in the re - writes." < br /><br />I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov 's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed . In the books , she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists , able to think her way through a problem . Here she 's just a damsel in distress , waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith.<br /><br />There are passing references to Asimov 's Laws of Robotics , but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes.<br /><br />Smith is likable , as he is in most of his films , but honestly , the story is n't that good . YOu figure it out long before these genius characters do .
0 This film was so disappointing . From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love ( why is it called this?)I had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery . It did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense . In fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time . In the end the effect was listless.<br /><br />I believe the film was meant to be atmospheric , but it just was n't . The lack of a coherent plot did not help matters . You might say it was mysterious , but I think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere.<br /><br />The main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation . Without looking at the cast list I would not have known that you see the main character as a child . The film has very little context for the time , place or character . I am not a prude but the sex scenes ( there were several ) seemed pointless and confused me further , I recognised Lulu but I was not sure if it was the same man , different men , a lover , her husband or was she a prostitute . It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover . This film did manage to make what should have been shocking ( dream sequences involving Lulu 's mother ) seem a bit boring.<br /><br />The nail filing actually made more sense , as it did give some indication of Lulu 's emotional state . I will not fault the actors as I do n't they had a lot to work on.<br /><br />I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull.<br /><br />I ca n't be bothered talking about it anymore .
0 Lately they have been trying to hock this film late - night on cable TV commercials . Do n't believe the hype . I was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres . This is , in my opinion , the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time , just behind Mac & Me ( # 1 Worst ) , and Jack Frost ( # 2 Worst ) , but I must admit , they are all close and all TERRIBLE ! Really , nothing of this movie is funny , or disturbing , or anything else it claims to be so do n't waste your money . The only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy . I 'm not lying about that . Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film . It is that awful . If you do n't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this , which I doubt you can finish . Two Thumbs Enthusiastically Down .
0 This film stars , among others , " SlapChop " Vince Offer ( who also wrote , edited and directed ) and Joey Buttafuoco -- not exactly names that scream out " quality " . And with such uplifting skits as " Supermodels taking a dump " ( it 's exactly what it sounds like ) , a guy who robs a sperm bank ( the " Rhymer " ) , necrophilia with a rotting corpse , black market fetuses ( featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar ) , lots and lots of gay jokes , a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions . The skits are painfully unfunny ( such as " Batman and Rhymer " ) , the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude ... and stupid . I truly believe a group of 8 year - olds could have EASILY made a funnier film with the same budget.<br /><br />Apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by " Slap Shot " Vince against the Scientologists . Frankly , I would n't know who to root for in this case ! ! ! Apparently , he alleged that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film . No matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99 % unfunny ( by comparison , Ebola is funnier) ... and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie.<br /><br />By the way , that IS Bobby Lee ( from " Mad TV " ) wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film . It 's amazing his career could overcome this .
0 This movie shows a row of sketches , which partly pass over into one another . I realized the passing over late in the movie , at first it only irritated me . < br /><br />Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact , using absurdity and obscenity . The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.<br /><br />My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie ( My god , it hurts in my head every time I call it " movie " ) : A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great . But it failed . At least the director made something out of nothing . But it is n't something good.<br /><br />Many movies did n't turn out as funny as they were planned , but this one tops them all . It 's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making . No . To correct myself , it 's even worse than that . A movie with gags so bad , that they are n't funny at all . It 's not even fun to watch the lead - actor , writer and director ( all three the same guy by the way ) perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies . The movie is too bad for that .
0 It really impresses me that it got made . The director / writer / actor must be really charismatic in reality . I can think of no other way it d pass script stage . What I want you to consider is this ... while watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors . It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there , not enjoying it , just feeling really bad for him coz he s of trying . I d really like to know what the budget is , guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor . I want to write ' the jokes did n't appeal to me ' . but the reality is for them to appeal to you , you 'd have to be the man who wrote them . or a retard . So imagine that in script form ... and this guy got THAT green lit . That s impressive is n't it ?
0 How do I begin ? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .It has no redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle . It failed to get even a single smile on my face . I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film . I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor . The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack , I 'm pretty sure that s the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place . I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap . I will leave you with this warning . DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM , IT SUCKS .
0 Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER , GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what ? It worked , I 'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this . Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true . Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us ! It was by far the worst movie I 've seen since Hollow Man . I generally avoid the crappy ones , but got sucked into this one . We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it , and his movie picking privileges have been revoked . There is nothing remotely funny about this movie ... even the " adventures of dickman " scene was sophomoric at best .. Color me p***ed . Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason ... no .. it just sucked . NEVER WATCH THIS ! for any reason whatsoever . Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny . That 's saying ALOT . Please for the love of all that is holy , if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie . It 's many things- stupid , pointless , and worthless to name a few . But the main thing it was aiming for : offensively funny- it failed miserably . Crash and burn ....
0 I have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru ... not one laugh in it . Ok , maybe one little chuckle for the Michael Clarke Duncan bit as the big , black , bald gay virgin . But the rest of it was shockingly un - funny . On top of being void of any laughs the " skits " go on forever ! Steer clear of this one if you value your time and money . DREADFUL ! ! ! The worst ! ! !
0 Words can not describe how utterly abysmal this movie is . It is a series of random , unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady ( REALLY disturbing ) . The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco , the best actor in this movie . Also , it is rated NC-17 , shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .
0 Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie . Now , imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity . Now imagine something 50 times worse.<br /><br />Got that?<br /><br />Ok , now go see The Underground Comedy Movie . That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever . UCM is the single worst movie I 've ever seen . There were a few cheap laughs ... very few . But it was lame . Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame , it was too lame to be funny.<br /><br />The only reason I 'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it . He wasted his money . Vince Offer has n't written or directed anything else and it 's not surprise why .
0 This movie goes beyond just being bad , it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life . Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film , ( if you can call it that ) .
0 First of all ..... <br /><br />What the hell ? Why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night TV with the promise of disturbing , offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul could n't watch . < br /><br />What the crap is funny about a dog being injured , a grandma getting her head knocked off ... a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom ? what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick . Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny , should not even be allowed to walk the earth . < br /><br />But from what I hear its not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage ... and they ca nt even pull that off .
0 The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I 've ever seen . I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase " guaranteed to offend " written on it ... meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh.<br /><br />This movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits , bad characters , and worse jokes ... from the pathetic Bat - Man sketch to the painfully unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit , they just are n't funny . The few skits that are a little funny are few and far between - watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin , for example - but even they go on too long and get ruined from Vince Offer 's ineptness at comedy.<br /><br />Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground ... bury it !
0 Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie . I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001 . It looked like it could be funny , but I was n't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first . I figured I would wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster.<br /><br />About a year and a half later , I was at Tower Records and in the " DVDS for less than $ 20 " pile , there was a copy of this movie . Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99 I decided to buy it . I got home , put the disc in the DVD player , and waited for the laughs to start ... and I waited some more . The laughs never came.<br /><br />I'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible . Sick , desperately tasteless , and poorly written and directed , THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time . No stars .
0 Sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one . You can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back . I will now look at Michael Clarke Duncan with apprehension ... why .... he lent his name to this vermin .
0 Sure , we all like bad movies at one time or another , and we in fact enjoy them , This however , was n't even a guilty pleasure , it was just crap . Some guy , vince offer , who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk / high -- probably both -- and thought it was a great idea to make a movie . He then proceeded to show his script to equally high / drunk individuals . Overall , this movie was so bad , predictable , and unoriginal I could n't get through 20 minutes of it before I turned it off . It makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane . Bat Man ? WTF ... Some guy that walks around with a bat , real original . Almost as good as calling him Fat Man , and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit .
0 The Underground Comedy Movie , is possibly the worst train wrecks I 've ever seen . Luckily I did n't pay for this movie , and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was . I love off color comedy . I figured at the least it would have that and I would be entertained . No , instead the acting was so awful , the " jokes " were extremely cheesy , and the plot was no where to be found . Maybe there was n't supposed to be a plot so I ca n't hold that against this movie . It 's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat ..... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat . Hilarious . Simply genius . I got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it . Perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just did n't understand . Or perhaps it 's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean.<br /><br />P.S. Do n't buy this movie !
0 My brother is an avid DVD collector . He took one look at the cover ( two models on toilets ) and had to add it to his collection . I stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie ( I use that term loosely ) I 've felt obligated to sit through . I dared not make eye contact with my brother , quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist . The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in one scene , which the " filmmaker " decided to show every take of ( about four total ) throughout the movie . In fact , the whole movie pretty much follows this suit . The fact that the DVD contained deleted footage was a shock . ( I went to bed without viewing it , however ) . To no surprise at all , I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week later .
0 I ended up watching this whole ( very long ) movie because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it . It seems difficult to believe that so many famous people ( Anthony Quinn , Lawrence Olivier , John Gielguld , Vittorio de Sica , etc . ) would have willingly participated in this farce . But maybe in 1968 people really * were * so naive ? The plot seems written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda . There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys , with the Communist Party General Secretary being a nice and spiritual man , who , suddenly , after 20 years , sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag . The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences . We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />Meanwhile , the communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death . To solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war ( in order to justly distribute the Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China).<br /><br />Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace . They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy . You will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like . Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay ( which is quite logical after all , do n't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists ? ) , and that the Pope needs to sacrifice something , too , for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice.<br /><br />So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome , he pledges the entire wealth of the Catholic church world - wide to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ . And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />Apart from this , there are also some minor sub - plots , which , alas , provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie . I 'd give it three Oscars for stupidity.<br /><br />By the way , Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a Pope . He is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek .
0 * Warning - no plot spoilers ahead , but movie spoilers nonetheless ... * My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all - star cast . Wow - very , very wrong . This movie is an overdone , overwrought , and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot ! The copyright date on the box said 2005 , yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s , and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s / early 90s dresses and hairdos . It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film ! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback , and therefore supposed to look old , but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s ... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up , and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences ( yet it 's a different , much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks ) . I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences , shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie ! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up ( and indeed acting the co - worker in the 2005 scenes ) . Thus , this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old , re - cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time . The shell story , shot in 2005 , is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead ( something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60 's to his girl that they would meet on the " fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 ? ) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful , overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie . Do n't bother . There 's a reason why you 've never heard of this movie even though it has a well - known cast - it 's terrible .
0 If I had never read the book , I would have said it was a good movie . BUT I did read the book . Who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline . There is so many changes , that it was n't really worthy of the Title . Character changes , plot changes , time line changes ... <br /><br />First off who was Henry and the investigator ? They were n't in the story . Henry had Mitch 's persona somewhat , but Mitch was n't a cop . No you made it so Roz , helped ' sink ' his body and used that as Zenia 's blackmail against Roz . The real so called blackmail was Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him . Her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being Gay from his mother . Her son was n't even really mentioned in the story . Neither I do n't believe was his lover , Roz 's secretary.<br /><br />Tony and West were not together in the beginning . He was actually with Zenia first while in college . The black painted apartment was their Idea , Tony just went to visit . This is where Zenia and Tony meet , become fast friends . Tony hides her love for West . Then Zenia left west , with cash from Tony , then West and Tony get together . Eventually marry , at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time . Only to be heart broken again . Then go back to Tony . Zenia 's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia . Now being a Professor at College she did n't want to let it get out . I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully.<br /><br />Charis character was a blond , not that it really matters . Zenia did n't trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive . No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy . Augusta 's father , he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war . Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal . Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis 's nose while taking care of them both . Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government , and leaves on the ferry with him . Not with Augusta , Charis was pregnant with her tho . Charis also had a split personality , Karen was her real name.<br /><br />Zenia did not die from being cut up into piece 's .... she fell or was possibly pushed ( we never really knew ) off the balcony and landed in a fountain . She had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she OD'd . She was also really dieing of Cancer this time around.<br /><br />It did n't show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader . The Book was striped down to its bare bones . Then re made in someone else 's vision . Why could n't you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie . It was different enough , and I 'm sure could have been made more so .
0 I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood 's novel ' The Robber Bride ' , and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version . A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder , and his buddy , an ex - cop journalist , tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman 's crazy female friends . It 's fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwood 's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men , victims of scheming women ... <br /><br />Heh . Okay , you got me . If these guys are mentioned in the book , and I 'm pretty sure they 're entirely made up for the movie , I 'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy . Apparently , the three main female characters of the novel are n't enough to carry the movie . Zenia 's manipulations are n't interesting unless we see them happen to a man , and a man 's life is screwed up . Roz , Charis , and Toni tell their stories -- to a man . Because it 's not important if a man does n't hear them.<br /><br />I liked the characters in the book . It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man 's story . I normally do not look for feminist angles on media , and I tried to enjoy the movie as is . If I had n't read the book , I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more . So if you like the cop and the ex - cop , and you want to read more about them , you 're out of luck . Read the novel , if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot . It 's the same plot : the movie excavated it , ironed it , and sprinkled it with male angst . It 's like Zenia 's revenge on Margaret Atwood .
0 When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film , I was intrigued . Being a fan of the book , I assumed she 'd be playing Tony , Roz , or Charis , but more so , I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head - y , almost psychological ( but not psychological thriller ) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who had n't read the novel , and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had . The book is a complex reflection of society , women , and modern life , and I was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film . What they actually did was a crime.<br /><br />The biggest error and confusing issue is : Why would Oxygen , a network that advertises as being for women , take an amazing book about how complex , wonderful , and terrible women are and can be , and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story ? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz , Tony , and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that , they rushed through bulk of the book . In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it , aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with . In the film , these women are n't people , they are characters.<br /><br />In the book Zenia does fake her death , but the book mentions it to get this point across , while the film wastes 30 - 45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use . They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order or CSI.<br /><br />It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia , which was SO wrong . Zenia is a Catherine Zeta - Jones , Angelina Jolie , or maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type . She is a woman men ca n't not adore , and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by , but in a " keep your enemies closer " kind of way . And once she gets closer , she seems totally genuine and trust worthy , despite your better judgment . She 's the kind of woman who , even when she loses , she wins : she 's always still beautiful , still rich , and there are always still people out there who do n't know her game.<br /><br />In the film , Zenia did n't take Charis 's man ( the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place ... ) but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian ( and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies ) . And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August , but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed . It 's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book , but I think had I not read the book , I would have spent the whole movie confused , if I had bothered to stick with it at all.<br /><br />And Roz 's husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture ( which was weird since Zenia took Roz 's business AND home life in the book , which is why Roz hated her so much ) and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz 's husband years and years back . And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever ... even at the party where Zenia and West ( in the book ) had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it ( and evil , bitchy ) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it . Tony 's character was SO wrong in this film ... she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky , mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book . The film basically implied smart women are evil , beautiful women are evil , powerful women are evil , and women who teach yoga are off their rockers.<br /><br />They basically tried to make it so Zenia was n't necessarily as awful as she was in the book , and then , in the end , the three women convince this former cop ( who , of course in the process of researching this , meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to Barbados or something ridiculous , which of course Zenia bails on ) to hide Zenia 's body ( which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at , but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony , or they conspired together to do it ... ) and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz 's money in the process . By the end of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials b / c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been.<br /><br />If you are n't confused by this breakdown of the film , then maybe you would like it , because I have read the book and seen the movie , and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused . It was terrible . I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task , but if you are going to take on the task , you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary , instead of creating some useless character to be our Alice in wonderland . < br /><br />Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of ?
0 I do n't know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book . I 've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works . I am aware that the translation of book to movie is n't perfect but this movie was the worst ever . The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it . I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie . This really should have been a mini - series to tell the story the way it was written.<br /><br />The actors for Roz , Tony , Charis and Zenia were well - chosen even though I was skeptical at first about Mary - Louise Parker . I only wish they 'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all .
0 I watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it 's about . Somebody got murdered or maybe they did n't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they did n't . This brought back memories of the good old days ( bad old days ? ) when all CBC Canadian movies were stinkers . Lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism , mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time . I 've never found Margaret Atwood 's books easy to read . This movie continues that fine Canadian tradition . It is n't easy to watch . Maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it . Us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious .
0 When this play was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago , it would have been something quite different for the time . So therefor some people would have found it quite scary , and may well have been impressed with the special effects?<br /><br />Looking at the play in this day and age , It does n't seem to be all that scary anymore , even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Would a train really be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT into a dark tunnel ? I do n't think so ...... but if you watch this play again , you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel , rushes straight through the RED LIGHT ! ( maybe that 's how it was in dickens time)?<br /><br />You will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a poor state . Surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the Signalman to climb up or down into the cutting . ( i ca n't help but notice things like that)<br /><br />I will not take anything away from the acting , both Denholm Elliott ( signalman ) and Bernard Lloyd ( the traveller ) gave wonderful performances.<br /><br />I am not at all sure what is going on ...... I mean was the ghost the traveller , or what ? ? ? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story ? ? ? ( well maybe i am the only one that don't)???<br /><br />To sum up ..... <br /><br />The play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout , with great character . It suffers from not being that scary these days , and a little if not very confusing in places , and has some rather unusual signalling practises .... <br /><br />Thanks for reading my review .
0 Movie had some good acting and good moments ( though obviously pretty low budget ) , but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed . The main point of conflict between the two leads does n't play out in a realistic manner at all . There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it , but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently , especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life ( and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money . ) Also , several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is ( apologizing to Adam for his past ) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and " traditional , " which the film proclaims to be the " good " way in the end . I do n't like being preached to like that . I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR , and he said that he presented this conflict between them because , if he was in Glenn 's shoes ( and he said he does in real life relate to Glenn 's view ) that he could never date someone with Adam 's views . Well , then , I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film . Also , director said he directed this , his first movie , only after reading ( Directing For Dummies . ) Directing was not that bad , but far from a top notch effort . I 've seen worse , but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated .
0 Or listening to , for that matter . Even the soundtrack is a bore . < br /><br />Honestly , this is n't the worst gay movie I 've seen ( that would be Regarding Billy ) , but it 's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />This thing drags and drags and drags . It 's not that the plot is inane -- in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining . There 's not one plot point you ca n't see coming for ten miles down the road . The dialog is flat . The jokes are old . To add insult to injury , it 's full of one - dimensional , stereotypical gays . < br /><br />Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible , much less real . There was no chemistry , no dynamic , in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we 're just told they 're in love . Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and are n't compatible sexually . They like the same book ? Huh?<br /><br />The acting is not totally bad , but the pacing is excruciatingly slow . I mean , almost Jarmusch- slow , but without Jarmusch quality . In fact , that would be a good barometer for you . If you like Jarmusch films , avoid this one .
0 A truly frightening film . Feels as if it were made in the early ' 90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good , normal , mainstream - aspiring people . Retrograde to the point of being offensive , LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad , lonely , sex - crazed gays . Wow ! Who knew ? The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes ( the effeminate buffoon , the bitter , lonely queen , the fag hag , etc . ) and the main characters are milquetoast , middle - class , middlebrow clones , of little interest.<br /><br />As far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned , there 's not much to say : we 've seen it all before , and done much better .
0 Words can not begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is . I wish it were " so bad it 's good , " but it 's not . It 's just dull , lifeless , and boring . It 's so bad I could n't even laugh at it.<br /><br />In response to other posters , Anne - Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie . The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly , who as a true statement on vanity , cast himself as the male lead . They both look like inbreeds , sister and brother.<br /><br />The gal , Sherry Thurig , is a looker . The complete opposite of Anne - Marie - attractive . This girl is tall and willowy , and can act . Although you can tell she 's holding back.<br /><br />All the actors seem to be holding back , especially the supporting male , Mark . I 've seen less wood in a rain forest , but he 's still better than Kelly . Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting ? Is he really that bad a director ? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there is n't one . Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime . I know how he felt stepping in the poo , it 's how I felt after watching his movie.<br /><br />Yes , I tried to get my money back from the rental store . This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director ( and if you search them out , you 'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks ) .
0 Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it does n't have a lower rating , and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating . This is not the case here.<br /><br />Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film . It does nothing right and it does n't have the chance to because it does n't really attempt to do anything . There are strands of a bad D&D novel kind of plot which does n't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout . It is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort , because even a completely patently untalented persons ' hard work would amount to more . A truly awful film .
0 I live in Ottawa where this film was made and I really wish it had n't been . This is one God - awful flick . I really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is : Indie Films Blow . Well , this film does nothing to shed this curse . The actor , writer , director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre , rather he re - hashes tired clichés from movies past . I am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting , it 's way too overdone . < br /><br />I can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights . Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension , but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie . As well for a movie that dares to call itself horror , a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore , other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring . < br /><br />The biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development , the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back . Not that this concept bugs me , but , I did n't really find it believable that when the two main characters , both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other . This is done in such a short time span that it 's inconceivable , my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her . < br /><br />The last point that I have is .... and I wo n't hold this against Kelly , but the movie is shot entirely on boring , emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film . Although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat . My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel , which has been reported on his website , a sequel that was half written in one sitting . < br /><br />Lord help us all .
0 A terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one . It needed some dependence on something.<br /><br />This totally miserable film deals with the interactions among Irish people . Were they trying to imitate the wonderful film " Crash ? " If so , this film crashed entirely.<br /><br />There is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem.<br /><br />The film is just too choppy to work . One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor . This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing . The older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.<br /><br />Then , we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank . Obviously , the robbery goes awry but there does n't seem to be any punishment for the crooks . Perhaps , the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film .
0 This movie blows - let 's get that straight right now . There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot . Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in " 12 Monkeys " and acts in a similar manner . I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he 's OK in this movie . There were two plot lines in this movie-= one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache . Let 's face it- this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go . THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script . The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene . But overall- Do n't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf -an American fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success .
0 I 'm Irish and I 've been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission . And I will go on record as saying:<br /><br />THIS FILM IS AWFUL.<br /><br />It is not quite as bad a something like " The Most Fertile Man in Ireland " but it definitely does not stand up there with other Irish films such as The Commitments , I Went Down or Michael Collins.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film are actually quite funny , such as Colm Meaneys American - style garda . But the film itself is shot completely wrong . The bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom - in , zoom - out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama . But it is n't . This is an Irish Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like this . It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next . The film just looks sloppy and thrown together.<br /><br />The performances are okay , given the awful script . A friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week . He gives a decent display as a Dublin Dirtbag , but it no way compares to his performances in Minority Report , Tigerland or Phone Booth . The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle - aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman . I think she should leave her god - awful stand - up and focus more on her acting.<br /><br />All in all , its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the Irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best Irish films ever.<br /><br />I'm expecting a backlash from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great . But before you reply , ask yourself : Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America ?
0 If you loved " Pulp Fiction " and like hand held cameras you should love this film . I liked the quirky story ( even though I feel that " Pulp Fiction " was the most over - rated movie since " The English Patient " ) and found the characters unrealistic but interesting . It 's not " On the Waterfront " or " Citizen Kane " and is burdened by European pretentiousness . But the worst part by far is the hand held camera . It is so distracting and annoying I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end . I do n't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great . If you are prone to motion sickness , stay away , the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes .
0 This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film . It was a big wannabee . It wanted to be an edgy , nervous - laughter , urban - life affirming film , but it 's more of a camera jerky , mess . It 's a lot easier to imitate something else , than to create a real story with real characters . From the beginning , I could n't care less about the characters or what they were involved in . They were always always hitting , pissing , or crying on each other . Only , there was n't any substance to what they were doing . The dialog between characters is meant to be hip , revealing , instead it comes out trite , and one scene after another is predictable . I know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie , so I could be wrong .
0 How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me . Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish movie . Terrible script , with forced character quirks ( the brown sauce ) . Romanticising all that is bad about Dublin . The attitude of ' ah , it 's a dump but sure is nt it great all the same ' . Plenty of tidbits purely for American audiences ( the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase ) . And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney 's character . A great actor forced to play this part that could 've been written by a five year old . Cringeworthy stuff . The best thing about this movie is Farrell , and it 's a bad when you have to say that . Well , at least he was nt putting on his dreadful American accent . International Audiences be warned : stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock . You 'll have a better time . Intermission is a walk - outer
0 This is absurd - aside from the fellow Australian who has reviewed this flick , I ca n't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of Elektra , considering how generous they were with their praise.<br /><br />Admittedly I 'm not really a fan of comic - book - to - movie conversions so I did n't go in with many expectations , yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming . The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film which went by unexplained , that left you thinking " huh , what relevance does that have to the plot ? " or " so how did that aspect of the character come about ? " I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil , which I have no intention of seeing.<br /><br />Furthermore , the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about - face at random moments to suit the storyline , and do n't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub - plot . I 'm also ( still ) scratching my head over the fate of Cary - Hiroyuki Tagawa 's character , which seems to have gone by unexplained.<br /><br />If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot , but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra . I know we 're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy / action films , but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing ( even by action film standards ) that it simply frustrated me.<br /><br />Well , hell , at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good .
0 Perhaps I 'm out of date or just do n't know what Electra is like in current publications ... But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan . She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved . Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.<br /><br />This movie was fairly weak on the dialog , the acting was n't particularly convincing , and the action was spotty . I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller 's book " Electra Assassin . " Which is much darker than anything in this movie.<br /><br />Special effect where cool , action was interesting at times , but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical . Tha Hand was not menacing enough , and Electra was not ..... bitchy enough . She 's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story , I just did n't care either way .
0 * * * THIS CONTAINS MANY , MANY SPOILERS , NOT THAT IT MATTERS , SINCE EVERYTHING IS SO PATENTLY OBVIOUS * * * < br /><br />Oh my God , where do I start ? Well , here - this is the first time I have ever come home from a movie and said " I have to get on IMDb and write a review of this NOW . It is my civic duty . " Such is the badness of this flick . < br /><br />*begin digression * But let me just state one thing before I start . I 'm not some Harvard - art - major - film - noir - weenie ( in fact , I went to the college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge , the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go , which should put me squarely in the nerd - who - would - obsessively - love - comic - book - films census group , and still I hated this film ... ) . My viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the Die Hards , Bond flicks , Clerks , and The Grail . I wish the Titanic had never sunk , not so much for the lives lost , but so we would n't have been subjected to that dung - heap of a film . And the single and only reason I will watch a snooty French art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed Emmanuelle Beart in it . I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on IMDb , for God 's sake . So I 'm as shallow as they come , therefore I 'm not criticizing this film because I 'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - it 's because Elektra stinks like a three - week - old dead goat . * end digression*<br /><br />OK , there 's so much badness here that I have to try to categorize it . Here goes:<br /><br />MS . GARNER : One of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot JGar ( I have no idea why my wife wanted to ) . I think that between this and " Finding Nemo " , the latter was the sexier film . You know the red outfit she 's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see ? You see her in it TWICE - once at the beginning , once at the end . Bummer . In the rest , she basically looks like what Morrissey would look like if he were a female - lots of pouting and black clothes . Which brings me to the incredible range of expression JGar shows in her acting - ranging from " pouting " all the way to " pouting and crying " . Oh my God , you 'd think she was being forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that . Um , wait ... <br /><br />THE BAD GUYS / GAL : They show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you 'd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit . At least next to JGar 's performance , it does n't stand out too badly . One guy 's role is to stand there and be huge , another 's is to stand there and have stuff come out of him , and the woman 's role is to stand there and breathe on and/or kiss people . They manage to pull these incredible feats off . The main bad guy has the most difficult role of all - he has to SIMULTANEOUSLY a ) appear angry and b ) appear Asian . He does a fine job at this . I think there was a fifth bad guy / gal , but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self - defense.<br /><br />PLOT TWISTS ! This movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention . Let 's just put it this way - my wife , who has only been in the U.S. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG 's pad , and I swear to God I am not making this up : " She go to house to kill girl . And father too . " And this is BEFORE THE FATHER HAS EVEN APPEARED ON THE SCREEN . Now my wife is n't stupid , but she is n't being courted by Mensa for her gifts , either , and she 's had zero exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre . And she figured this out in .00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information . Such is the blatant obviousness of this film . < br /><br />RARELY - BEFORE - SEEN STUPIDITY ! OK , so there 's this big dude in the film . He can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it 's lint , and he can take a vicious Electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal ( or melt it - or something - more defenses kicking in , thank God ) . But JG jumps on his head , and he explodes ? An Achilles noggin ? OK ! Such is the mind - numbing stupidity of this film.<br /><br />Ack . I 'm starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on , so I have to stop . But you have been warned . If you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie , DO IT . And if Armageddon is going to come , please let it be > before < this comes out on DVD .
0 Believe me , I like horror movies . I like science fiction movies . I like independent films . And , I like low - budget , B movies . < br /><br />Sometimes , I even like bad acting , plodding scripts , wooden lines , improbably situations , and the like . However , I did not like Christmas on Mars . < br /><br />It just does n't work on so many levels . For all the reasons listed previously , and many more . That includes the nonsensical , blatant use of images of female genitalia . And the many allusions to male genitalia , in a very Freudian way.<br /><br />I am convinced this is purely from ineptitude . As opposed to some attempt at doing something really different . I mean any movie that takes years to film , just can not keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences.<br /><br />I had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character . However , sadly , it was meant to have happened , as we saw things unfold on screen . < br /><br />About the only kindness that I can express , is that the image at the end was stupendous . If this had been used at the beginning , instead of the end , it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended ... < br /><br />To bad they did n't try that instead . I just do n't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made . Was it the plot ? Surely , it could n't be . Was it the characters ? I doubt it ; I mean , I could live without knowing about Ed 15 . Was it the dialog ? Emphatically , no . The music ? Perhaps , but more - likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked . < br /><br />Much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor .
0 A friend once told me that an art - house independent film ran in a cinema when- upon the closing of the film - audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats . Of course , my imagination ran amok , trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work . Well , now my imagination can be put to rest.<br /><br />I am a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work . I have come across many people who thought Tarkovsky 's films are slow - moving and inert . Opinions being what they are , I found this not to be true of the late director 's wonderful works , which are wrought with meaning , beautiful compositions , and complex philosophical questions . Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called the heir to Tarkovsky , I was excited to experience his films.<br /><br />With the exception of the open air ride through the fields ( Stalker ) , this movie has no kinship to anything Tarkovsky has done . It does not seem to possess the slightest meaning , even on a completely mindless level . It 's supposedly " gorgeously stark " cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft . There is a no balance , no proportion , and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow . The main character is so inept and indecisive , it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner.<br /><br />I am also not adverse to non - plots or story lines that progress on multiple non - linear fashion . But there is n't even a non - story here . One must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost , as hair - pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a Tarkosky time sculpture look as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short.<br /><br />I wo n't rule out that this may be one of Sokurov 's stinkers ( Tarkovsky 's Solaris ) , but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky 's heir - based on this film- would be to call Paris Hilton the successor to Aristotle . C'mon guys , do n't be afraid to say it . No amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life . I do n't profess to fully understand Russian culture and I probably do n't have Russian values , but I immediately picked up on Tarkovsky 's work as something magical , a treasure and a gift to viewers.<br /><br />If it did n't have Sokurov 's name on it , and it aired on say , Saturday Night Live , I 'm pretty sure nobody would " read " all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick .
0 I 'm actually watching this film as I write this . . . If the following comments " prove my lack of development as a true , artistic film maker " , then so be it . . .<br /><br />But . . . I thought ( am still thinking as I 'm presently viewing ) that this film . . . to put it mildly , is very , very overrated . Again , very.<br /><br />It looks like a really , really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources . . . and who did n't pay that much attention to detail.<br /><br />I do n't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that I find this film lacking , but . . . well . . . I just do n't get it ( rememeber , I fully admit that maybe it 's ME that 's the idiot here - not the film maker - for not getting this " piece of imaginative genius " ) . . . I rented this on a whim because the reviews were very , very outstanding . . .<br /><br />Sheesh . . .
0 I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival . Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin . Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll 's ' Alice ' books I was very excited about this movie 's premier , which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch . Normally I 'm enthusiastic about modern re - tellings if they are treated well . Usually it 's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story . Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion . The adaptation of the original 's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying . It probably did n't help that the actors were n't very good either . Most performances were ridiculously over the top , which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script . I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film . All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by . Really , the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice , but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman 's work . Also , I 'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance - off was awful . It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.<br /><br />What a joke . Do n't see this movie . After its conclusion I was genuinely angry .
0 I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment . Once I realized I would not be getting that , I watched it for a pretty well made movie ( in terms of filming , and yeah .. that was it).But aside from it having a good film quality , considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long , there was nothing good about that movie.<br /><br />He killed 42.Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully?Serisouly , Who can answer that for me?Who can answer anything awful about this movie for me.<br /><br />I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff . That 's all it seemed to be.<br /><br />Poor Mr . Carroll . I'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales .
0 This movie is terrible but it has some good effects .
0 Though the movie may have been " true " to Lewis 's book ( in that the script was basically word - for - word , verbatim ) , it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this . The mythical creatures ( unicorns , centaurs , griffins , ghouls , ghosts ) are * drawn * in , and as in the previous review , the green - screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow . I nearly laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ; I nearly cried when I heard the wolf 's " howl-- " a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could.<br /><br />All of the acting is tremendously forced , especially that of little Lucy Penvensie ... I could only take so much indignation , desperation , and buck teeth in the ( what felt like ) fourteen hours of watching the movie . The actress who plays the White Witch , in all her histrionics , seems that she 'd be more at home on stage , where a booming voice , spread arms , and a valiant effort at something Shakespearian would be more than welcome . < br /><br />The sets feel claustrophobic , whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors . Indoors , it 's as if BBC could only afford to spend $ 100 on constructing a set , and so it is very small , and all the characters are constantly huddled together . The White Witch 's castle is a run - down , rotting countryside English castle filled with Styrofoam statues and bad lighting . When the Penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually , * any * scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles . < br /><br />The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan , but you can bet that BBC probably blew the film 's entire budget on building the mechanical feline . It looks great when it 's standing still and before it starts speaking , but once it starts moving , you ca n't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear - end in the lion suit . < br /><br />Yes , if you are a hardcore Narnia fan , you may want to see this version , simply because it preserves every word that Lewis ever wrote-- but Lewis was certainly no screenwriter , and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen . During the scene in which the children are at the Beavers ' and getting ready to flee from the wolves , Mrs. Beaver 's incessant , " oh , just ONE more thing , dearies , and then we will be ready to go , " punctuated by the children 's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of " NO , Mrs. Beaver , PLEASE ! " -- a scene of comic relief , so incongruous ( they are supposed to be FLEEING from imminent danger , not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not ) , detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have . In fact , the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these . < br /><br />I would recommend seeing the new Narnia ( Disney 2005 ) . The new movie , with updated effects , spectacular computer animation , great timing all around , and a gorgeous and scene- stealing White Witch ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician , as opposed to a shrieking banshee ) captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting the least bit from Lewis 's original vision ( I think ) . Lucy is a lot cuter ( NO buck teeth , YAY ! ) , as are the beavers ( and realistically - sized ) , and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine , Desperately - Hungry - for - Acceptance - Insecure - and- Angsting - with - an - Inferiority - Complex Edmund that the new Disney version fronts . < br /><br />Unless you 're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies , I would not recommend this film to anyone .
0 Ouch ! They do n't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewis 's beloved novel . While the adaptation is very true to the novel , the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play . I 've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time , but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $ 2 that it looks like this was filmed for . The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver . I know computer effects were n't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time , but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid . Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role ! Avoid this at all costs .
0 I 'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books . I wanted to see this just to see how it was done . All i can say , is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it . Its pretty bad , and will turn you off reading them . Not to be mean , but Lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie . Was she the directors daughter ? Seriously , I 'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth . She had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame . The movie just loses so much in translation . CS books do n't translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books , or even Harry Potter.<br /><br />One thing they did right ! Aslan ! very well done . Although the other human actors with painted faces ( beavers , wolf ) look silly , Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around . ( i guess its like that old horse custume ? 2 people inside ? ) Also , i would be curious what kids think of this movie . Maybe they would enjoy it ? But as for adults , safe bet they wo nt , even if a CS fan .
0 Having watched this after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005 , I came here to pan it -- but after reading the other comments , I have n't the heart . Clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age . Well , let me not be a complete Grinch ; it might still work for some children -- if they are not too media - saturated and have not become visually over - sophisticated , e.g. from watching all of LOTR and Harry Potter . But if you are an adult , stay miles away ; you will not enjoy it.<br /><br />The good bits : Barbara Kellerman as the Witch , especially in her early scenes with Edmund , creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness . ( At the Stone Table she goes a bit over the top . ) Michael Aldridge in the minor role of the Professor and Jeffrey S. Perry as Mr. Tumnus also have the kind of polished , skillful acting we 'd expect from the very best BBC dramas . And the Aslan costume works very well , amazingly well considering . They got the eyes just right.<br /><br />The bad bits : almost everything else , but two areas in particular . One , the casting . England is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British school kids . How could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs ? They move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well . Peter has no gravitas or charisma ( and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings ) ; Edmund is just whiny ; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically , visibly , drastically wrong for this part that I ca n't imagine how she got the job.<br /><br />Two , the animal costumes . Again , it appears that they worked for some kids . If the kids are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting , believable characters , they might be entranced by this film . But to a viewer with the sophistication of , say , a 12-year - old who 's seen Prisoner Of Azkaban ? When Mister Beaver comes out from behind that tree , there will be hoots of cruel , derisive laughter . The costumes just do not work -- I could not , and I think any adult or modern teen could not , suspend disbelief when looking at Mister Beaver . The drawn animation later ( gryphons , etc . ) works better , is easier to take.<br /><br />So : ten stars for the very young and tender of soul ; everyone else read , or re - read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination .
0 I am a student of film , and have been for several years . And the concept of a cyber , kung - fu , satirical chimpanzee had me wondering , " Is this the film that 's going to break the mold ? " Let 's face it , America has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar . After such great classics as " Monkey Trouble " and " Dunston Checks In " , I thought that the best ideas were already taken . But then comes " Funky Monkey " . I laughed , I cried , I contemplated suicide.<br /><br />Now I 've read about demon possession in the Bible , but that still does n't explain why someone would create such a product of evil . First off , having at least a shred of intelligence , I realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape , not a monkey at all . However , I was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film . They did n't . Let me sum up this work of art : A company by the name of Z.I.T. has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers . Why ? I think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas , but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp , this does n't seem cost - effective . Well anyways , Z.I.T. brings in a CIA specialist ( Matthew Modine ) to train Clemens ( The Chimp ) . Clemens is everything Z.I.T. hoped for . He can take out an entire shift of guards , who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall , and yet still manage to remind us that we 're watching a kid 's movie . As you may have guessed , Modine finds out that Z.I.T. 's intentions may be evil ( Gasp ! ) and decides to break Clemens out . Being a CIA agent and all , Modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city , rent a guest room , regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime , and using checks to pay for everything.<br /><br />Z.I.T. finds out where Modine is staying , and sends two of their finest to retrieve him . These guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since Martin and Lewis , or was it Turner and Hooch ? It does n't matter anyways , because in the end , for a heck of a twist ending , the good guys win ! ! ! Yay ! Hooray for predictability ! Throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself , a lonely mom who needs a date , and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by Radio Disney and you get " Funky Monkey " . The climax to the movie ? A football game ! Played by thugs , bumblers , a chimp , and the nerd boy . No one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game.<br /><br />Funky Monkey never lets up ! It 's edge of your seat entertainment . Some might even call this the " American Beauty " of monkey - filled features . After finishing this epic , I recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe . Funky Monkey is a metal rod among movies .
0 I bought this movie from Gamestop 's discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99cents . The movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike . Not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey.<br /><br />The director more than likely committed a murder - suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent Warner Bros. film and he ended up owing money to the studio . It also does n't help that he was n't even infamous for the terrible job he did , he was n't even known for producing a poop - chute film.<br /><br />Why was this movie ever made ?
0 This is the story of two guys who found a copy of ' Funky Monkey . ' Finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon . After seeing such classics as ' Every Which Way But Loose ' and ' Project X , ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome.<br /><br />These guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie . There was some monkey that was replaced by a Stunt MAN when action sequences were required . It was apparent that the monkey was n't trained in the school of Shakespearean acting . Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys thought.<br /><br />Maybe a strong sidekick would help like a Jackie Chan or heck maybe even Hulk Hogan . Luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet Li look - a - like Matthew Modine . While some might argue that Matthew Modine does n't come close to Jet Li , camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good . When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp ca n't handle the movie , the movie leans on Matthew Modine to be the real star.<br /><br />Did I mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with Modine and the monkey ? Is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie ? Even Matthew Modine should get jealous with this one ( because using the pick - up line ' I 'm second fiddle to a monkey ' does n't seem to work with the ladies.)<br /><br />Shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine telling them ' Seven days . '
0 If there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste . The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse . The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine , but WHERES THE EXPERIMENT ? All i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i do n't know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and silly . The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY . If you set a ' challenge ' do n't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in ' friday night games ' . make them do an actual challenge . And as for ' earning ' prize money , that s fine , if they actually earnt it ! These people are nuts . If only they would make the show better , the actual idea would be glorious . But that ai n't gon na happen !
0 This rubbish excuse for television is the single most god - awful piece of trash ever to hit Australian television . The house - mates are dull , uninteresting , ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them . As far as I am concerned Big Brother is the decline of western society , showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain - dead morons . Whatever happened to television that did n't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience ? This can not be classified as entertainment . I think that it true that Channel Ten can remove your soul . It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedian and , once moving to Channel 10 , become horribly unfunny . With the exception of The Simpsons which is highly intelligently made .
0 I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input . I know they 're going for realism , but to be frank I just do n't want realism . Realism is boring . If I want to see daily life , I 'll uhm , live . Tell me an interesting story and we 'll talk . I can deal with the low production values , hell I 'm a sucker for low production values , but at least work in some good ideas . The direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit , but obviously I 'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic . Hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out . I can only conclude this is not drama , not by a long shot . We get to see Rosetta walking to someplace , Rosetta working in a bakery , Rosetta eating a waffle , Rosetta carrying around bags of far , Rosetta walking back home , Rosetta walking someplace ... it 's just not that entertaining . There is n't really a deeper meaning either . I got so bored I started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it 's just plain realism , the most overrated quality in the business . I guess I 'm supposed to love this , but come on , there 's nothing in there .
0 I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious ! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I could n't believe that someone would make such a worthless film . There is nothing interesting about the plot , the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects . Also , if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film , be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand - held camcorder and half the time you ca n't even see the main subjects . This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as " Blair Witch " because it creates suspense . In Rosetta , there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything . I should have known better when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible .
0 If I had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease - inducing Dogme 95 style , I would never have rented it . Nevertheless , I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot . I lasted a very , very , very long forty minutes before giving up . It 's just boring , pretentious twaddle.<br /><br />The last French movie I saw was " Romance " and it too was pretty dismal , but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time . I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas -- it 'll catch on in America about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy . ( It 's called Dogme 95 because that 's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.)<br /><br / >
0 I go to the cinema to be entertained . There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film . From beginning to end , there is no respite from the gray , grinding reality of this woman 's life . It is one - paced , with no change of mood . I remained until the end only because I was convinced that things must get better . They do n't , and I do n't think I was the only one , as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close . Honestly depicting social depravation is no crime , but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public . A dreadful film .
0 What were they thinking at " Cannes " ? One of the most irritating , films of all time . Every detail of this film , no matter how meaningless was shown . If I had to watch her put on those boots one more time I think I would have shouted . If the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had , then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running . But no , we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over . The whole thing was filled with un - likeable and unsympathetic characters . They deserved the misery that was Rosetta . And to think I passed up " Tumbleweeds " to see this over - hyped film of boredom . It was like watching grass grow , only that is more exciting .
0 First of all , I became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes ( cause of the bas screenplay ) . I do n't think this movie has any purpose . It 's boring from the first minute to the last . I do n't understand why this movie scores so high . I gave it 1/10 but actually it 's not more wurth then 0/10 .
0 " That ' Malcom ' show on FOX is really making a killing ... ca n't we do our own version ? " I speculate and paraphrase , of course , but in our hearts we all know it 's true , and that the only thing NBC added to the ' Malcom ' metric was sex . And , boy , did they add sex ... <br /><br />Thirteen - year - old Tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard . Tucker accidentally walks in on his Aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off . He spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window , and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window . And this is all in the pilot.<br /><br />Take it from a grown man- a boy 's puberty is so sex - crazy and testicle - driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience . The only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies , and you can count those on one hand . So it 's no surprise that " Tucker " has the warmth and appeal of a strip - club bathroom . Did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty ? Is n't this the stuff people go to jail for ? If you doubt the show 's depravity consider this : 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes aired ; they then made the unprecedented move of " burning off " the remaining episodes by airing them AT MIDNIGHT so no children could see them . Ironic since kids were originally the target audience . < br /><br />Apart from its general scuzziness Tucker features a running voice - over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing . Even in 2000 it was horribly dated , with it 's ska incidental music and super - sarcasm . I could n't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes did n't exactly come a mile - a - minute ... Shame on NBC for this dirty rip - off ... they 're better than that.<br /><br />GRADE : C-
0 Words ca n't simply describe how awful this film is . I watched it on video last night , and I simply could not believe what I was seeing . Basically , " Snakeeater " is about an ex - military man ( Lorenzo Lamas ) and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by Deliverance - style Rednecks . The film 's acting , writing , direction , photography , and editing are deplorable along with a song called " Soldier " that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time!<br /><br />However , there is one treat . " Horshack " ( Ron Pallio ) from " Welcome Back Carter " is in the film playing a laughable bad guy . Otherwise , please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS .
0 Now , I 've seen a lot of bad movies . I like bad movies . Especially bad action movies . I 've seen ( and enjoyed ) all of Jean - Claude Van Damme 's movies , including the one where he 's his own clone , both of the ones where he plays twins , and all three where he 's a cyborg . I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians . ( Hey , if nothing else , he 's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it . With DVD , you can even pause and zoom in ! ) That 's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad , it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Everything about Snake Eater is bad . The plot is bad . The script is bad . The sets are bad . The fights are bad . The stunts are bad . The FX are bad . The acting is spectacularly , earth - time - bendingly bad , very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so - called actor in the cast , including Lorenzo Lamas , and that 's really saying something . And I 'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed , to boot . ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas . < br /><br />It does manage to be unintentionally funny , so it 's not a total loss . However , I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very , very stoned . I was able to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry.<br /><br />It did n't help much , but it was better than nothing . One point for Ron Palillo 's cameo as a gay arsonist .
0 This is a really bad film , with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though!. All the characters are just annoying ( except Lamas ) , and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for ! , plus the action is very boring . The film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring , laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up ! , plus it looks very cheap and amateurish!. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but he ca n't save this piece of crap , and believe it or not the opening was really cool , as was the ending , however the middle is incredibly boring , and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button ! , plus The dialog is especially laughable!.There is a cool bar scene that i really liked , but once Lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart , plus the scene where The villains torture Jennifer 's family , and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable!. This is a really bad film , with bad acting and a very boring pace , Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though ! , however it is not enough , not recommended . The Direction is very bad . George Erschbamer does a very bad job here , with mediocre camera work , bland location , and keeping the film at a boring pace . The Acting is pretty bad ( except for Lamas ) . Lorenzo Lamas is awesome here , and while he is n't required to act , he is quite fun to watch , and has a really cool character , and had a lot of charisma , however even he ca n't save this one , and he had no chemistry with the cast either ! ( Lamas Rules ! ) . Josie Bell is terrible here , and while she 's decent looking , she is n't very convincing and had no chemistry with Lamas . Cheryl Jeans is hot , but does not have much to do but scream and scared , she did okay at that . Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying as the main villain , and was n't menacing at all , he was laughable as were the other 2 . Rest of the cast are bad . Overall Avoid ! Avoid ! , even if you do like Lamas ( like me ) . * out of 5
0 Lorenzo Lamas stars as Jack ` Solider ` Kelly an ex - vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks . Atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is third billed , and yet has 3 minutes of screen time , and even those are n't any good . Overall a terrible movie , but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few ( unintentional ) laughs . Followed by an improved sequel .
0 WOW what can i say . I like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick , but Snake Eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance .Lorenzo Lamas , pfft more like Lorenzo Lameass this guy has as much acting ability as Bill Clinton has self control . It has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse . Crazed Hillbilles YEP ! needless tit shot ( with a real weird scar ) YEP ! crappy soundtrack YEP ! I wish i could give the movie -10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes . Seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it ca nt be real ...... the worse thing THERE IS 2MORE SNAKE EATER MOVIES ! ...... guess its in demand .
0 First , let 's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor , barely even decent , sometimes just plain lousy . However , in this piece of @*!^ called SnakeEater , the film industry as a whole sank.<br /><br />First , let 's start with the plot . A Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly , aka Soldier ( who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some , which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys ' feet and pins them to the floor ) , gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped . Therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister . Had some potential , but still pretty thin to begin with.<br /><br />Now , the acting . Being an actor myself , I am qualified to say that this was some of the WORST acting in the history of the art ! ! ! ! ! Lamas is , well , himself . The jackasses playing the Clampets / Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so - called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere , especially talented ones who never get their big break!<br /><br />Finally , the action . The gunfighting is so - so at BEST , and the fist - fighting is deplorable . I 've seen more real - looking fights at the Renaissance Festival ( and those were pretty fake - looking)!<br /><br />Readers , listen to me : AVOID THIS PIECE OF CACA AT ALL COSTS ! IF IT WERE THE ONLY FILM IN EXISTENCE , YOU STILL WOULD WANT TO AVOID IT ! For the sake of your brain - cell count , do NOT watch this thing !
0 This movie has some of the worst acting that I have ever seen ! Some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor . This nail trap catches these bad guys . The rest of the movie degrades as you go . I ca n't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time . I also ca n't believe that there are sequels ! The next crap movie that I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this?<br /><br / >
0 I was not expecting much going in to this , but still came away disappointed . This was my least favorite Halestorm production I have seen . I thought it was supposed to be a comedy , but I only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes . Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over ? What was up with the janitor in Heaven scene ? Fred Willard has been hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations , but this did not work . They must have spent all the budget on getting " known " actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget . It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark . Does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket , as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket ? I try not to be too critical of low budget comedies , but if you want to see something funny go to a real Church basketball game instead of this movie .
0 Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people . If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie , how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of pain . For starters , there was a musical montage every five minutes . There was no character development . Every character was a stereotype . We had swearing guy , fat guy who eats donuts , goofy foreign guy , etc . The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot . The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation . Have the directors , producers , etc . ever even seen a movie before ? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry . The concept for this movie sounded so funny . How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors . But trust me when I say this , things went wrong , VERY WRONG .
0 I wanted to like this film , I really did . It 's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat . It tries too hard to be funny in some places ( the daughters over zealous cooking attempts ) , over reaches in others ( the scene where they clean up someone 's yard , so he agrees to join the team ) and has some scenes that , while mildly interesting , are really just filler ( all the work scene 's ) . And I did n't find the " villians " intimidating , or worth hating , so much as I found them to be childishly annoying . < br /><br />I've met people like those in the film while playing church ball . And I will say the referee 's are spot on , Still , in the end , I really did n't care all that much about the characters , or their quest for church ball glory . Maybe because they were all so one dimensional , which I might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall . < br /><br />Kurt Hale , and Halestorm entertainment , has made some good films , but this is not one of them .
0 I 've never been a huge fan of Mormon films . Being a Mormon , I 've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos . I was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air , the Halestorm movie I could finally discuss with my non - Mormon friends.<br /><br />Boy , was I wrong.<br /><br />I figured , since this had B - list talent like Clint Howard , Gary Coleman , Andrew Wilson , and Fred Willard ( one of my favorites ) , this would have to be at least a little funny . And besides , church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such . But I must say , throughout the entire movie , it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing . Every joke fell flat , and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored . The dialogue was bland , and the film had some of the worst character development I have ever seen . Every single character but Wilson 's was less than one - dimensional . It 's hard to believe that after nine re - writes the film was still as mind - numbingly stale as the train wreck I witnessed . I ca n't put into words the rage I felt sitting through this . My friends and I were extras in the final game scene , so we went to the premiere in Washington City , UT . Kurt Hale , the director , was there , and I must say , I avoided all contact with him after the show . He waited at the door , seemingly ready for feedback . I could n't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life , but it left a nasty , painful scar that I will never forget.<br /><br />Here are a few specific problems I had : There was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player , but these two characters came out of nowhere , and were impossible to care about , so my friends and I were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame , uninteresting characters . There were many subplots that popped up every now and then , each promising the audience the chance for laughs , but each one came and went in a puff of smoke , ending before you could even start caring . This was pretty much how the whole movie felt.<br /><br />This film was a major letdown , and I feel bad for everyone who 's expecting the first REAL funny Mormon movie . True , the jokes in this one are n't too exclusive to Mormons . Then again , it 's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears.<br /><br />Please , do NOT see this movie . Keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious . Spare yourself the disappointment I went through
0 First of all , let me say the I am LDS or rather , I am a Mormon . So when I watched this film , I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt . I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch . And this one was no exception . It does have its redeeming moments . But they are few and far between.<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though Halestorm was ashamed of our Church ! In the LDS Church , congregations are called " wards " and the basketball court is in the " cultural hall " . NEVER ONCE are either of these two names mentioned . The Church is never referred to by name and " the standards " is as far as it goes in mentioning what our Church believes.<br /><br />It makes me wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes ? This film had so much potential ! It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer , but also what we believe . Instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired . If I were not already LDS , I 'd be left thinking Mormons are stupid , idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs.<br /><br />It is NOT a film I will recommend to my nonLDS friends.<br /><br />Sorry Halestorm . You can do better than this !
0 Trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you 've heard about semi - devout Mormons , and you 'll see they 've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film . Finally Kurt Hale 's fortunes have changed ( thank goodness ) and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters.<br /><br />The cinematography was amateurish ( I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes ) . The plot was limp and very unfunny . You really did n't understand why anyone did anything . It was like I had sand in my eyes , and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face , it was that painful.<br /><br />The only reason I did n't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale wo n't let me .
0 The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget " Halestorm Entertainment " has had to work with . All involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash . Not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful , but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best . The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop PC . The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing . I think just because I could n't believe that I had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching it in had actually agreed to show the " film " .
0 I went to see this film with fairly low expectations , figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff . Sadly , it was n't even that . I could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out . I went with my two kids ( ages 10 and 13 ) and even they kept asking , " How much longer ? " After lasting until the end , I just kept wondering who would approve this script . Even the reliable Fred Willard could n't save the trite dialogue , the state jokes , and the banal plot . I 'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie ( I use the term loosely ) should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class . At the least , there are many books on directing , screen writing , and producing movies that would teach them something about structure , plot , dialogue and pacing .
0 This movie is a total dog . I found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so I would n't feel like I 'd totally wasted my money -- and my time . The writing in this film is absolutely terrible . It 's a shame it 's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies.<br /><br />They should have saved the money on getting D - list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right . Even Gary Coleman was n't properly utilized for his role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was -- including the subplots . After viewing this movie , I 'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite - like humor , where it 's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery . Unfortunately , this movie fails to deliver the lines , the characters , the delivery or the humor . I should have gone to the dentist instead !
0 This movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet . It made the RM & Sons of Provo look like well done films ! It was supposed to be funny from what I was told . The best part was the best actor in the movie - Travis Eberhard - if he was n't in the movie it probably would n't have been made ! He ruled!<br /><br />10 . It was n't funny 9 . It was beat 8 . It had Thurl Big T Bailey , who 's character made no sense 7 . It was made in Provo 6 . It did n't make fun of Brokeback 5 . It had Larry H. Miller in it 4 . It was the 1st movie Clint Howard was n't funny in 3 . Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2 . They should have cast at Surreal Life auditions 1 . It was made by Halestorm Entertainment ! !
0 Just saw this movie , and what a waste of time . The movie was predictable and slow . It 's basically the Mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball . Rather than watching this movie , I should have had a root canal . The cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding . This movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by Mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball , however because it 's rated PG , the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film . The acting is horrible with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard . Thurl Bailey 's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary .
0 Reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high : a big budget , tons of popular faces , a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves . The end result is a disaster . Alice Tremblay 's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it 's audience ( I did n't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation ) , going through it 's page - thin story line and one - dimensional characters without a single spark , not a sign of the magic it wished it had . The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly could n't seem that great an idea on the set , let alone on paper . ' L'Odyssée d'Alice Tremblay ' is a collage of comic sketches , linked together with a ( very ) thin layer of good ideas . Avoid or boredom will haunt you .
0 While the idea is more original than most Sci - Fi movies , the execution is , as usual lacking . While the practical mummy effects are not bad , and the " Gun Nut " character is over the top giggle inducing , the only real draw is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen . I suspect that was the idea all along . They do the best they can with what they have but the " must see " moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena 's character sported some Tomb Raider style shorts . Not high brow cinema I know but you ca n't deny true beauty when you see it ! ! ! And Adam Baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate . If you just want to watch a couple of your favorite Firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you . If you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere .
0 I 'm at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this " poppycock " of a movie . They had a pretty interesting idea , with the buried movie set , and that was it . So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story . There is the buried set , some wolf headed monster running amok , an amulet , and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is . What I would have missed , had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase , some really bad C.G.I. , some incredibly stupid dialog , more bad C.G.I. , and the hero fighting paper cut outs . Other than the original idea , this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities . My mistake for continuing to watch . - MERK
0 Watching the first 30 minutes of Sands of Oblivion gave me high hopes . It seemed I was in for a cheaper version of the Mummy . The setup was promising , in the 1920 's Cecil B. Demille makes his opus of the Ten Commandments . It seems in using real Egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil ( do n't they always ? ) . Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down . Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time . Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site ( the movie 's first mistake , but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci - Fi channel movie ) . The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it 's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect . Then the body counts starts . This is were the movie went south for me . The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction . Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do ? They make the usual stop to the " guy who knows the truth but never told anyone " . After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site ? No , they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk . Really I 'm not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I 'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem . After this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way , by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it 's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades . For a Sci - Fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out , which is n't saying much at all . What disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it .
0 TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20 's during the filming of DeMille 's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille 's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the worst films I 've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film ? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness . If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons . You will laugh long and hard AT this film , probably more than many other Hollywood " comedies " .
0 Worse than the rating it has been given . This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays : bad to awful acting , a script that is poorly written , and shoddy direction . From the opening scene where DeMille is burying his set to the end , this movie is terrible . In the beginning scenes this movie has Moses ( which was Charlton Heston in the DeMille film ) , Pharoah ( Yul Brynner ) and Nefretiri ( Anne Baxtor ) overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand . The characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to " supposedly " be . The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance . The screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert . I was sorely disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality .
0 I make a point out of watching bad movies frequently , and the sci - fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find . As such , I 'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of oblivion . The acting was uncharacteristically sub - par , as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci - fi usually has in store for us . There are a few cameos made by people you 'd most likely recognize , although you may not know their names by heart . The CGI special effects are minimal , and as such , one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci - fi feature is lacking . Sure , there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer , or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he 's known for a couple of days , but overall , it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter , and I consider that a major disappointment.<br /><br />If I was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made - for TV movies , I 'd probably give it a 4 , maybe even a 5 . A real shame that I may have to wait ' till the next sci - fi original movie to get a good laugh , and I really hope that this movie is n't part of some overall quality increase in sci - fi original movies .
0 This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have to disagree with another commenter , who said the special effects were okay . I found them pretty bad : it just was n't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.<br /><br />Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story . The archaeologists are looking for " the set " . They do not bother to tell what set , or what is so special about it . That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California , while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt.<br /><br />If you 're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert , take the effort to actually go to the desert . The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.<br /><br />The action - level was constant throughout the movie , no ups and downs , no climax . It made the movie look short , and that 's certainly a pro for this particular movie .
0 Bollywood fans pretty much hold Amitabh Bachan 's Mard in high regard but I think it is very overrated . Manmohan Desai collaborated before on movies like Suhaag , Parvarish , Amar Akbar Anthony , Naseeb , Desh Premee and Coolie and I have seen all of them I liked so I had very high expectations before I watched Mard and was bitterly disappointed . My main gripe about Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2,maybe Mr Desai ran out of ideas , after all he had been using that formula for years and years . 1 . First of all some members of the cast is repeated from AAA , for instance the police inspector who brings up Amar , the Muslim who brings up Akbar , Nirupa Roy and a few more . 2 . In AAA Nirupa Roy loses her eyesight , in Mard she loses her voice 3 . In AAA there is the famous song ( Shirdi wale sai baba)well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali . Having seen AAA for over 1000 times I noticed that straight away.<br /><br />My other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous , true Manmohan Desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with Mard I thought he went too far . My last gripe is that compared to songs in previous Manmohan Desai movies I found the songs rather disappointing . I know it has many fans that swear by it but I did n't like it one bit . It actually pains me to write this review because I am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since I was a child .
0 Manmohan Desai made some entertaining though illogical films like AAA , PARVARISH and NASEEB but he made some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS < br /><br />This movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous Mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe < br /><br />The British are made carricatures and the film looks so weird The scene in the British hotel is damn stupid < br /><br />The film has many stupidities like Amrita assaulting Amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse There are more gems like the horse statue getting life , The masks of Amitabh haha and more < br /><br />Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad Music is okay < br /><br />Amitabh does his part with style , nothing different from COOLIE , LAAWARIS type roles Amrita Singh is okay Satyen Kapuu is okay Prem Chopra is as usual , Nirupa Roy is again her usual self Dara Singh is also as usual
0 I 'm a fan of Columbo , especially on a rainy Saturday , and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451 , but this episode was very lacking . The original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance , even years before the modern detective shows of today . But it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and " modern " electronics equipment and , of course , the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale . The high - tech home is a Jetson 's or Disney version of Tomorrowland , and fun to think of writers inventing those " way - out gizmos".<br /><br />If its sunny outside , go play , as there are much better Columbo episodes . Still , we should be thankful for Cable TV that these episodes are being broadcast .
0 For domestic audiences I can see how they would applaud this movie . For outsiders , with no vested interests , it did not make much sense . The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes . The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction . How a young woman could ' love ' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense . How she could , as mentioned at the end of the movie , never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me . I mentioned the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh . Several hundred German troops advanced , pushing the Russians into the marsh . So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening . I suppose they did not want to get their boots wet , but I am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh . But that would have ended the story . Also , the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof . At the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in.<br /><br />I did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end . I wonder why ? You knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart - tugging in that .
0 I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war , avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles . Zvezda barely does the first . Zvezda being a Russian war film , I was expecting patriotism , sentimentality , beautiful poetic pictures , a lush score , Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans . What I did n't need was the naive love non - affair , the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references ( Stalinism , Nazism , Holocaust ) only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about " liberating Poland " . A missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently .
0 Ai n't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him , turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way ? That formula never gets old , does it ? It 's such a sure fire way to make a classic film ! Just look at major hits like Liar Liar and Big ! ... This must have been Rob Schneider 's line of thinking when he made semi - successful Deuce Bigalow : Male Gigolo and followed it with The Animal . Since I 've already traced the plot through sarcasm , allow me to color it in more : Schneider plays a loser cop who 's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery ... by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts , causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times , run like a cheetah , etc . This movie is slightly more likable than other Schneider - starring flicks ( such as another lame same - plot follow - up The Hot Chick ) , but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality TV star as the romantic lead ( Colleen Haskell from " Survivor " ) and inserting a cameo by Norm MacDonald . My favorite scene ... just does not exist . Sorry - nothing memorably good except the production value . I just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay , but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way ( " You can DO it ! " ) , there 's a word for that - " milking . " Actually , here 's another word - " cheap . "
0 Marvin(Rob Schneider)does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream . But his luck changes when he has a car crush(a very bad one)and is found by a doctor . The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him . After this moment , he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be . By the time , he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side . In the mean time , he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised . I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider . In fact , this is the his first film I have seen . However , I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser.(See his part in Ally Mcbeal , quite funny actually).There are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat . In such movies , the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent . I am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously . But very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office . The Animal is not the worst film I have seen to date but fails to get more than * .
0 I did n't really like this movie that much at all . It was n't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid . Rob Schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this , it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in . I mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that 's about it . The only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and I 'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found . All in all it was a couple notches below an average movie!<br /><br />Final Query:<br /><br />Theaters : So glad I did n't squander too much money on this.<br /><br />DVD Purchase : Ummm , let me think .... no!<br /><br />Rental : If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not .
0 I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly . It is not even funny . Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it . In the first half hour , Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk . All I could think was " he deserves it , for making such a bad movie " . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .
0 I saw an interview with Rob Schneider ( who plays the lead character , Marvin Mange , in this film . ) He said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you 'd be laughing at this movie . Obviously that must be the secret . I had the volume turned up . I was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster , and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after Schneider 's hilarious performance in " Deuce Bigalow , Male Gigolo." < br /><br />The story is stupid : Mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named Dr. Wilder ( Michael Caton ) , and as a result starts to lose control of his " animal instincts . " This makes him a " supercop . " He can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses . Of course , he also has a nasty habit of eating people 's cows and trying to seduce their goats , but surely that 's a small price to pay ? It just did n't do anything for me . < br /><br />The cast left much to be desired . Is there a more irritating actor in all of Hollywood than John McGinley ? Here , he plays Sgt . Sisk , Mange 's commander on the police force , as a repugnantly cartoonish character ( much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular TV series " Scrubs . " ) I was anxious to get a look at Colleen Haskell 's first " serious " acting job ( can anything in this movie be called " serious ? " ) She , of course , gained her fame as a contestant on the first " Survivor " and she proves here what we knew from that : she 's cute as a button . What she does n't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress . And what 's with Ed Asner as Police Chief Wilson . I mean , how old is this guy now ? He 's the size of some of the cows Mange tried to eat , and he seemed out of breath the whole way through . I 'm surprised he made it through the filming . There 's a brief cameo at the end by Adam Sandler ( who also served as Executive Producer of this.)<br /><br />Anyway , I chuckled twice : Mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car , and the scene Schneider has with Haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more acting talent ! So , for two chuckles - 2/10 .
0 This is a very bad movie . I laughed once or twice , and the storyline sucks ! There is maybe one funny joke , it is stupid and it is boring . Through the whole short movie , I was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end.<br /><br />No one acts human , and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous . Rob Schneider acting like an animal is n't something I would pay to see . It looked funny , but the bottom line : DON'T WASTE YOU'RE PRECIOUS TIME ON SUCH A RIDICULOUS AND STUPID MOVIE.<br /><br />I was wondering when it was going to end , even though it is a short movie . In the beginning we thought it would get better ; but it gets worse . Stupid , all the way to the end . I walked out of the theater , and I would remember that movie as extremely bad forever.<br /><br />The writer and co - producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer , but this is nothing like The Simpsons ( this movie sucks ! ! ! )
0 NOTHING in this movie is funny . I thought the premise , giving a human the libido of a randy ram , was interesting and should provide for some laughs . WRONG ! There is simply nothing funny about the movie . For example , the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer 's yard is not funny , it borders on obscenity . They are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level , and it just ai nt funny.<br /><br />We all know that dogs will eat anything , anywhere , anytime . The main character doing this with everything , everywhere , everytime is also not funny . It becomes a cliche.<br /><br />Rob Schneider is , I guess , acceptable in the role . By this , I mean that he 's not a bad actor , but with rotten material it 's difficult to comment on quality . However , Coleen Haskell , the other half of the HUMAN - romantic leads ( does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too ? ) , seems embarrassed by the whole thing , as well she should be . She seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum , detached from all the other actors in the movie . < br /><br />See this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless , dull , repetitive material .
0 I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow , which I enjoyed . However , this dud seemed to last forever . It 's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of PG-13 while not being kid appropriate . The jokes are n't just low - brow or f**t jokes , they 're crude , lewd , and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency . Many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it might have made a bigger splash as an R - rated film if the funny was left in . ( Overstatement ? Probably . ) I do not recommend this movie . It is a full - on waste of time ... and I 'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot . At 45 minutes in , the movie felt like it should be winding down ... and boy were we ready for it to . The ending is quaint but does n't salvage the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental . 1/2 star ( glad I saw it as a freebie ... would have been sickened to pay hard - earned greenbacks for this tripe )
0 Redundant , but again the case . If you enjoy the former SNL comedian and his antics ( in this case , Schneider ) , then you should go . Basic comedy  .man 's life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him . Unfortunately , he takes on each animal 's characteristics . Former Survivor Colleen looks pretty good here , now that she does n't have open sores on her legs , and a little makeup on her face ! D
0 Guy is a loser . Ca n't get girls , needs to build up , is picked on by stronger more successful guys , etc . Seen it , saw it , moved on . I 'd have to say that Rob needs to move past the Adam Sandler part of his life . And get out of the Adam Sandler plots . There are two funny parts in the whole movie . I could n't even finish the last 5 minutes . I was getting bored . " The Animal " is an alright film . I do usually enjoy Adam Sandler films that have the same plot . But this was trying too hard to impress . The jokes are very old . So , trust me . This is not a film that most people could really get into . But some did , so I 'll be nice.<br /><br />3/10
0 I hired this movie expecting a few laughs , hopefully enough to keep me amused but I was sorely mistaken . This movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it ... Aimed at an age group of 10 - 15 , this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied . Worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives .
0 Rob Schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements , facials and performances of " not humans " . This time he is The Animal . Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day , nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked , so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man . But on his way to the crime scene , he crashes with his car and gets really damaged . He does n't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day , his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts . Of course , we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings , are useless . She is played by Collen Haskell . There are no negative characters . The negative character , is destiny if I could use this metaphor . Marvin should find out , how to become a normal human being again . By the way - his animal instincts , helps him in some situations . Schneider 's performance is a so - so . The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies , called mindless fun as I have written above . So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in . He is a great comedian but this is not his best movie .
0 I have been reading the reviews for this movie and now I wanna kill my self . I do n't wanna live in a world where people find this move or Rob Schneider funny . What is wrong with these people . I 'm not angry at Rob Schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat . I watched this film in disbelief . Who would pay money to make this ? ? This film is so bad that its painful . Most bad films are funny because they are crap . The Animal is just DISGUSTING ! ! ! Watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self . We do n't need you . I want to raise money to get Rob Scheider off all movies . If someone killed Rob Schneider they should be given a Nobel peace prize .
0 And a few more " no"s on top of that . Voodoo Academy is , without a doubt , the least ambitious film of all time . What exactly is it trying to do ? Tell a story ? Obviously not ; as has been pointed out , most of it 's just barely - legal guys rubbing themselves . Could it , then , be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism ? Well , maybe , if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact . ( Which is , to the delight of none , repeated about eighty thousand times . ) Well , it is sort of a horror movie ; is it trying to scare us ? Not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his " work." < br /><br />Never in my life have I enjoyed a movie less . This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I 've ever seen . It 's like Voodoo Academy takes the genres of horror , zombie , and gay movies , puts them in a grinder , then runs them through a coffee filter -- only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans , it 's the kind that takes out everything vital , edgy , or in any way interesting . The result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water -- only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10-day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort .
0 You ca n't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days , and I had expected it to be campy anyway . ( It 's not all that campy in reality . With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter , who do n't take themselves seriously , the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight ; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad . ) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to , which kind of shocked me ; I assumed the whole purpose with these ultra - low - budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story , but they use lots of words like " technological " and " physicality " in the script to get their point across . ( Although it 's possible that the story is important only to explain why there 's so few cast members . ) Nobody cares about this stupid storyline , and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft - core homoeroticisms ( which are n't all that edgy ) . I would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason . The film is grainy , with a TV - quality look and acting level . There are a few " sexy " scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers , feeling themselves up ; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny . And I liked the digs at L. Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones , but it still is n't any good . 3/10
0 Cheap and mind - blisteringly dull story and acting . Not a single good line , not even a line bad enough to be good , and no memorable delivery . Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having . The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic , and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable . The ' homoerotic ' overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying , and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers . I 'm not gay enough to appreciate it , but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake .
0 If you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one . A setting and acting as in a Porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind . Which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action . A few of the actors I 've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better . All the special effects are done by the great " Rondo " Whom performs all the magic whit his mind . A cult movie is written on the box . Does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all???<br /><br />Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving .
0 This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life ! ! It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous ! ! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life ! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller ) . I do n't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie ! ! I did n't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves . I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn ! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch ! I was very disappointed ! ! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion .
0 i know you 've read that before , on countless other films no doubt if you 're reading the comments here , but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i 've been able to track down . no doubt the really bad ones are n't even available to buy or watch on tv , but even so i feel it 's fair to qualify that i 'm not just some dumb renter who picked badly.<br /><br />i've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb , and i 'm ticking of the remaining ones with every chance . most of those stand head and shoulders above this ... excersize in absolute monotony.<br /><br />i like to rate truly bad films ( as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are ) by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through . if you can watch it by yourself , it is n't that bad . if you can watch it with one single friend ... it 's bad but could be a lot worse.<br /><br />it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy . and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films ( spotting the boom mic for example , 3 times in this one if i 'm not mistaken ) could take away the dry taste in my mouth . yes i 'd watched it , but i 'd also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end.<br /><br />i hope and pray we saw the directors cut ... to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me . so much of the film centers around this.<br /><br />i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget , just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes . but it is n't a good film . the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money ( considering inflation ) and was an utter gem . it 's not an excuse for how bad this baby is.<br /><br />spoilers ahead ... <br /><br />it 's not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters ... the pacing of the film ... is insane ... nothing ... is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging . no matter what your alignment or sex ... rubbing just can not sustain that kind of screen time.<br /><br />the acting is cheese ... but not overly amatuer ... i 've seen a lot worse in better films ... but somehow it 's the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you 'll ever hear in a film , that really grates.<br /><br />rent this if , like me , you have a fascination with the worst of the worst , and only if you 're going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it . this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair . it 's an endurance test you probably want to skip.<br /><br />i'm sure there is worse ... but i would n't be surprised if it has decoteau 's name on it .
0 I have seen a lot of bad films . Most of the time I can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is . But this really takes badness to new extremes.<br /><br />It is bland , the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it . There are no shocks , no horror , no suspense , just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish.<br /><br />A blight on the crappy horror genre , avoid at all costs.<br /><br / >
0 " Voodoo Academy " features an " Academy " like no other , one that houses only six male students in one bedroom . These teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest , who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously . The sole administrator of this " Academy " is a young and seductive headmistress , and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash , so to speak.<br /><br />Sexual overtones abound , and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies . These young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the " Academy , " and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie . If you 're not interested in the male form -- stay away!<br /><br />Burdened by weak and awkward dialogue , this low - budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns . The mood is claustrophobic , with tediously long takes , a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes . These visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue , intended as character and plot development . It gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days ...
0 This is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be . I dread to think what the Blockbuster - approved edit must have looked like , because the director 's cut on DVD was a bore of the epic proportions . Naturally , you do n't expect it to be " The Godfather " , but an acting class or two might have come in handy.<br /><br />Also , there were so many cute guys in this movie , but they were woefully under - exploited . I like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their BVDs as much as the next guy , but even I have a right to expect a little more . It was n't a total loss , though ; at least we got a peek a Drew Fuller 's ( covered ) junk and truly upsetting haircut . And there 's Huntley Ritter looking even cuter than he did in " Bring It On " ( and acting about as well ) . There 's always a silver lining , kids . You just have to look really hard for it . And occasionally , you have to make use of your pause button .
0 This movie is AWFUL ! I do n't even know where to begin , I 'm speechless I ca n't even describe how awful this is . The blood is flourescent first of all , and the acting is AWFUL ! The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day . This movie was rediculous , I do n't see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad . It looks like it was made by highschool students .
0 I saw the trailer to this film and it looked great , so I went out and bought it . What a mistake , the acting is a shambles , the special effects ( if you could call them that ) , look like something that would n't be out of place at a school play . Some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen , which unfortunately is all to often . As for a story , forget it . This is a warning , do n't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen . If , for some reason , you like this film watch Troll 2 , you will probably enjoy that as well .
0 I thought that this movie was pretty lame . If you 're looking for cheesey , you may like this . I , myself , do n't mind a fair amount of cheese , but this was ridiculous . The progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak.<br /><br />The only thing entertaining about this movie was the day - glo zombies , but even that is n't reason enough to see this flick .
0 Worst movie I have seen since Gingerale Afternoon . I suppose that this is a horror / comedy . I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie . The special - effects were not so special . I believe that I could come up with as good of effects from what I have lying around the house . I wish I could have something good to say about this movie , but I am afraid that I do n't . Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey . I do , after a little thought , have one thing good to say about this movie - it ended .
0 This film is absolutely horrific . One of the worst movies I 've ever seen . The story does nearly not exist , the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special - FX only make you laugh . The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officer.<br /><br />If this film was supposed to be a comedy I did n't quite get the point . If you want to watch this movie : please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs ... especially when the first Special - FX appear on the screen.<br /><br />But if you like trash movies made on the cheap : this film is a must - see for you .
0 ...... this film is pretty awful , the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that I unfortunately have seen worse.<br /><br />The jungle music , juttering demons , and fluorescent UV style blood / teeth / eyes give it that " awful " look , and the script is dire ..... this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it . It 's also predictable but not in a good way . Nothing this film does is in a good way . I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought I would rant a bit so there you are . ( oh and the acting does n't let the film down , it 's also terrible )
0 I just watched The Convent for the second time . I had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken Friday night film , some gore , some style , bit of humour and suchlike . I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much . It seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile . For the record I 'm not even a huge fan of Night of the Demons , but there were some things I really dug about it . The Convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much . Apart from the main girl ( likeable performance from Joanna Canton ) , the goth girl and a sweet cameo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable , festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic , offensive jockhood . The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that , given the awful dialogue , it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film . The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes , though not scary their certainly kinda cool , and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore . Towards the end , when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy . The stylised direction also occasionally yields good results , although sometimes the camera just moves too fast . All in all , this was a film where for me the shining good points just ca n't make up for the things I hated . Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more , but for me it was n't a good time .
0 When I tell people that I review movies as a hobby , the first thing they say is " What do you think of such - and - such movie ? " There are a couple of problems here . Firstly , there is the probable chance that I 've not seen it and thus , I ruin my reputation . Secondly , I could trash the movie in question without realising that it 's actually their favourite . Lastly , I could be given DVDs to watch so they can judge my opinion . Thus , I find myself sat before " The Convent " which is the sort of film I would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here . More 's the pity because this frankly dreadful " horror " is about as scary as a box of kittens.<br /><br />Following well - worn clichés , " The Convent " focuses on a bunch of American high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned , laid and mildly spooked . But you 'll never guess what happens next ? A group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition . Will any of them survive and more importantly , have n't you got better things to worry about ? < br /><br />The only thing that saves " The Convent " from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of Coolio 's bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger . It 's far too amusing to be properly frightening - the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason , the day - glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie - but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered . But even if they were trying , I still doubt that it would work - demonic nuns wearing the sort of make - up you 'd see in the " Buffy The Vampire Slayer " TV show are n't really that scary . The scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 % of voters gave this a maximum score . I mean , I know it 's funny but I hardly split my sides . To be honest , I 've had more fun in a dentist.<br /><br />"The Convent " is n't really a horror movie as such . It 's more of a comedy horror like " Scary Movie " or " Shaun Of The Dead " but you 're laughing at it instead of with it . I honestly ca n't recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then , I doubt very much they 'd enjoy it . I do n't enjoy the " so bad that it 's good " genre - I personally feel that if the film - makers ca n't be bothered to salvage a turkey then I should n't bust a gut trying to watch it . Yes , it 's a bad film and yes , they really should have gone home and done something more constructive . A Rubik 's cube , for example . The DVD box has two price stickers - one for £ 4.99 and a reduced price of £ 3 . But it was sold for £ 1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy , cheap , awesomely bad flick . Sorry if you do like it but " The Convent " really is a pile of unholy crap .
0 In fact , these young people were so distasteful that I could n't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered , and that includes Clarissa ( Joanna Canton ) since I considered her the most annoying of the bunch.<br /><br />But I knew it was gon na be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background . It had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />Even the prosthetics looked fake and the " blood " looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch , although later on it took on red day - glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing . I 'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh - t since it 'll appeal to that bunch . It sure did n't appeal to me . Blah ... <br /><br />And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself . She still looks hot , though . I 'm glad she takes care of herself since we do n't get to see too much of her nowadays.<br /><br />However , it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli 's meandering HORROR ( 2002 ) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot , so I 'll give it that much . That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch . I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end . It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film.<br /><br />Lion 's Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up.<br /><br />2 out of 10
0 This film was n't programmed in Italian cinemas , I have seen it at a manifestation called " fantafestival".I find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark , the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there 's no suspence in the film . Music is completely out of the story and I do n't have words to describe the visual effects . If you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting , but a few minutes later it becomes busy . The story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .
0 This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen . From the very first scene , i knew it would be a smash crash . It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission . As it turns out , the people in it were possessed by some random zombies . Well , some years later , some college kids are pulling some pledge prank . Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock . Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non - chalonte manner , with pledge over reacting and over - doing the whole " eager to be popular role " What really took the cake with this one is the final battle . Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns . For example , guns making a noise with no muzzle flash , and vice - versa . this is accompanied by stop - animation zombies ( why they move in stop motion is a mystery ) , cheesy music , and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere.<br /><br />Overall , this movie is crap . Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place .
0 My friend 's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out , so when she brought home The Convent , a horror movie , i could n't wait to watch it . Given that it 's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious , I can say that in some weird way , I like this movie . < br /><br />yes , the acting is bad , and yes , it 's the cheapest movie i 've ever seen , but it 's so damn funny ! " WHAT , ARE YOU SMOKING CA - RACK ? ! " i did n't know this movie even was ever released ... i figured it was too bad ... < br /><br />Yeah , so ... overall the movie is pretty bad ( you got ta admit that much at least ) but I promise you , you will get a good laugh out of it.<br /><br />*this movie kinda sucks but it 's good for a laugh ... especially that guy that holds the ' dagger of despair ' .. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR !
0 This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen , and I have quite an appetite for awful ( and good ) movies . It could ( just ) have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue - in - cheek --à la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW , which was really very funny . Other movies , like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE , manage to be funny while ( apparently ) trying to be serious . As to the acting , it looks like they rounded up brain - dead teenagers and asked them to ad - lib the whole production . Compared to them , Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness . There was one decent interpretation -- that of the older ghoul - busting broad on the motorcycle .
0 What more can I say ? The acting was , almost without exception , amateurish . The directing and continuity were pitiful . The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious . One of the features on the DVD was labeled " Gag Reel " but that could have been a description of a viewer 's reaction to most of the movie.<br /><br />One of the most amusing things was in the director 's comments on the DVD . He said , with a straight face , that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast - and that he had succeeded . With delusions like that it 's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster . The darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit ( per the ' making of ' feature on the DVD ) and rather looked it . The mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store . The cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game .
0 This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick . The video is dark and poorly lit . The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed . The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun ! [ filled of course with silver bullets ] . The acting is as wooden as the characters . The FX are non - existent , lots of extreme close - ups of werewolf jaws and biting . the only thing that is shown is lots of soft - core T&A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic : " Dog Soldiers " with Sean Pertwee .
0 Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads , this movie is really , really bad . The cheap production values do n't help . Of course , you would n't really notice that the production values are cheap if they did n't keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with . Even for a B - movie genre freak like myself , this movie really sucks .
0 A documentarist , like any filmmaker , must convey a compelling story . Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort , cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomsky 's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton . The footage is shot amateurishly and in video . Pascoe 's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen : " 9 - 11 , " " Activism , " " Truth." < br /><br />Lame.<br /><br />Compare this with documentaries like " The Corporation " or " The Fog of War " which create a narrative drawing material from interviews , stock footage , and filmed footage . In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.<br /><br />The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky 's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma , and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes.<br /><br />One of the more interesting passages was Chomsky 's recounting of his experience with National Public Radio . He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views , while NPR 's liberal dogma strait - jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages . Yet another media outlet to be skeptical of.<br /><br />This documentary is for Noam Chomsky completists only .
0 First off , I agree with quite a bit that escapes Mr. Chomsky 's mouth . His matter - of - fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus . He comes across likable , unassuming , pragmatic . He does n't cater to the current political style ( obnoxious bi - partisanship ) and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right , chastising both , and for good reason.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the film itself is a dud . In fact , I would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches . Watching " Rebel Without a Pause " is no different from watching a speaker on a 3 am taped segment on CSPAN . There are no camera movements , no edits , no stylistic touches . There is no story , no narrative.<br /><br />Technically speaking , the production is strictly amateurish . Audio is terrible and inconsistent ; sometimes we can not hear Noam speak , other times we can not hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance . When Noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her.<br /><br />I can not recommend this film and would say that you 're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or CD to listen to in the car.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars ... and I 'm in a generous mood today .
0 Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , I really had no opinion of the man , save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist , although I could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings . So , stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky : Rebel Without A Pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , I decided to get it , just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . While glad I got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about?<br /><br />For a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the New York Times , according to the DVD 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and I would n't even want to watch what a William F. Buckley could do to him . Granted , the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . But , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ?  . Even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further insulate the man from reality , by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins . What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film , this much I knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the Soviet Empire . The film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . His wife , Carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . She seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . The lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the Chomskys , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then.<br /><br />Not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . It 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . Stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky , videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . This is really poor film - making by director and editor Will Pascoe , who in the DVD 's Filmmaker Statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomsky 's . Other than that , one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer . He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds.<br /><br />Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomsky 's lectures at McMaster University , in Ontario , Canada , prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 , much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era . Yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on American media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out cabals . As example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . Similarly , he claims Trilateralists run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . Of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when Castro and company were great sponsors of it , in Latin America , Asia , and Africa , until the Soviet Union fell . I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in Idaho.<br /><br />In his simpleminded world without grays , Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . In short , Chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . Near this film 's end he warns , ' Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . Please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , DVD .
0 Watch the 1936 version . As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer 's voice , he 's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan , depressed Rudolf -- I mean Omar Sharif tries but , no -- too cute and vibrant . Catherine Denueve ( sp ) besides being too old looks nothing like Marie -- nothing ! She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion.<br /><br />The only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they 're playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief ( and look up pictures of the empress there 's more than a passing resemblance ) as historically , Empress Elisabeth was n't involved that much in Rudolf 's life .
0 As good an advert for republicanism as you 're ever likely to see,"Mayerling"is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century Austria . Set during one of Europe 's seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the Emperor Franz Joseph ( Mr James Mason),his rebellious son , the Crown Prince Rudolf ( Mr Omar Sharif)the Empress(Miss Ava Gardner ) and various mistresses , secret policemen , spies , extravagantly - uniformed popinjays , gypsies , dancers , wives , soldiers , swans , horses and the bizarre inbred web of European royalty at the time of Franz Joseph 's Austro - Hungarian Empire . Filmed in what the old movie posters used to call " A Riot of Color " it resembles nothing more than an expensively - dressed but intellectually - challenged production of " The Student Prince " .Mr James Mason , wearing a very natty little white number , utilises his all - purpose mittel - European accent whenever he remembers . I am a great admirer of his and I sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing . Mr Omar Sharif , who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful , gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the Crown Prince . He is utterly unconvincing as a man who -in the movie at least - cut a swathe through the distaff side of the Austrian aristocracy . With his well - buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms . As a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk , leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes . Unhappily married , he falls in love with a commoner."Forbidden Love " is one of the movie 's come - ons . As she is played by the most uncommon Miss Catherine Deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there . Miss Deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it , particularly in the sequence set at the ballet . Now I love ballet as much as the next man , but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time , a more cynical critic might consider it to be " padding " . Rudolf 's mother , the Empress is played by Miss Ava Gardner . She gives the part some good old American oooomph , making her a bit like " Auntie Mame",but it 's done with undeniable style . Rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother - I 'll put it no more strongly than that . The only performance worth watching is that of Mr James Robertson Justice as Sir Lancelot Spratt - sorry , Edward , Prince of Wales . He is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it 's a joy to behold . I waited vainly for him to ask Rudolf the immortal question " What 's the bleeding time ? " . I am not qualified to dispute " Mayerling " 's historical accuracy , but , in my opinion , everything else about it is risible . It is a Ruritanian Opera Buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling .
0 I 'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie , but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright 's novel , which the movie is based on.<br /><br />We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12 , and just watched the film . During periodic note - taking and checking of the clock , I contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning . Of course , the sky was completely clear , and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it.<br /><br />Wright 's novel discussed very real themes , of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it . Silver 's movie turned a murderer into a victim , which is NOT what Wright wanted ( see : " How Bigger was Born " 454).<br /><br />I'm going to make this short and sweet : if you want to leave your consciousness , in Raphael Lambert 's words , unsullied , skip the movie and read the book . The 1986 adaptation is not thought - provoking material.<br /><br / > ... : : sigh : : Now I have to write the essay .
0 Of all the movies I 've seen , this one rates almost at the bottom ( Haunted Mansion , Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom . ) It is hasty , the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted . Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer 's door . The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous , and illogical . Oprah gives a palatable appearance as " Bigger 's " mom , but is not nearly at her potential . Other famous performers also seem to be at their worst . The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur . In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted . One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk . Now the family he 's working for are not against blacks , but he thinks they are . So when he comes home he puts her to bed , but she begins caterwauling . The blind mother ( yes ) hears this , so Bigger tries to silence her , but instead smothers her . Now fearing he 's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do -- he shoves her into the coal furnace . So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace ( the idiot did n't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes . He is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom . If your desperate for a bad movie , this one could do the job , but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40 's and 50 's or see a good drama , there are a lot better options . Avoid this .
0 Hey look , deal with it , there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black America than this . Although I think this story is weak , my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story , which I have mentioned , blows.<br /><br />This was made in the mid-80 's and is horrible in the music / score department . It 's funny to see Oprah as a latter - day crack - whore type.<br /><br />The scene where Bigger stuffs Elizabeth McGovern into the incinerator . Pure classic cinema . First off , I do n't care how drunk you are , you will react to 1200F degree flame ( no matter how bad your acting ) . But they really milked that scene ... it was comical . I 'll tell you what though , I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn in a faux death ; she annoys me .
0 I generally do n't give worry much about violence in films , or a vast amount of philosophy , symbolism or psychology . All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us . There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature , a good setting of characters , a good direction . This film could be voted for as a good film . However , it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting.<br /><br />First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film . Not movie violence , I am talking about REAL violence . This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and that s reason number two ; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women . Not that we all do n't have some real twists with women.(respectively men ) . But the conclusion of the film ruins it all . < br /><br />*spoiler * Our " heroine " finally dies , ( by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me , now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch)and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon , nature growing over her , in particular her sex .. Of course it is the director who " kills " the women heroine . Women have to die , especially if men are attracted by their sexuality . That seems to be the final conclusion.**end spoiler*<br /><br />Well , well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself . But to use big pictures , artsy directions cruelty to living creatures , just to say men can be frightened of women , and men are cruel to women . That s just not enough . I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the " philosophical , eastern and artistic " and whatever approach . But to me this film is just totally marred .
0 Is this the same Kim Ki Duk who directed the poignant , life - spanning testimonial of " Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter and Spring " ? The same Kim Ki Duk who directed the exquisite , nearly silent , heartbreaking longing of " 3 Iron " ? The same Kim Ki Duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of " The Coast Guard " and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all ( characters and viewers alike ) to experience redemption in " Samaritan Girl " ? I just can not seem to find him in this film.<br /><br />Oh , sure , Kim 's nature motif is still present . The film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters . Yes , it 's Kim Ki Duk , all right . Kim even describes the film as " beautiful " in an interview included in the DVD 's special features . But I 'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation.<br /><br />What is beautiful about angry , potty - mouthed prostitutes , lustful , violent and potty - mouthed fishermen , a covetous mute merchant , explicit animal torture , sequences of self - mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality ? These are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film . If it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater , this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material . It has been favorably compared to " Audition " by Japanese director Takashi Miike ( much to Kim 's satisfaction ) , but aside from some astonishingly good performances , especially given what they had to work with , by lead actors Seo Jung and Kim Yoo Suk , I find little reason to recommend this film . I have not seen " Audition , " but I doubt it would alter in any way my view of " The Isle . " Its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic . Its sex is not pornographic , but passionless and masochistic . Characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot . Its point is either non - existent or , I will admit , lost amidst Korean cultural quirks that I fail to understand.<br /><br />The only beauty is in the cinematography , which is classic Kim : fog - shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake , mountainous terrain dominating the background , and an imaginative and playful use of color . At times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big Kim Ki Duk romper room . Some touches , like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by Jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes , are intriguing . But as a film , this effort is downright confusing and , in the end , offensive to the senses , not necessarily to sensibilities . One hopes that Kim will leave this kind of film - making in the trash heap of his past , for we know he is capable of so much more .
0 I 'll say this much -- This director is all about RAW images ... things most of us are not ready to confront head - on . Images of sex , suicide , murder , and people " relieving themselves " are constantly bombarding the viewer , which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release . Although I do n't think that I could ever see this movie again , I will say that the director does have a good eye . There were some really nice shots and " picture moments " in the film ( the fans , the wire fish in their hair ) , but the story left me needing more ( strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves " what the heck did we just see?").<br /><br />Note : If you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily ... don't see this film .
0 I really ca n't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star ... How can you like such a retarded film , where all the animal abuse scenes are real ? I do n't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments ... Jesus ... What kind of ' ' human '' would torture them like that for no reason , or just for money ? I tell you , that director is either mentally retarded , or he 's just a monster with a ' ' heart '' of stone . Or both . He truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive.<br /><br />It contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock , especially to sensitive persons and children : a real frog is skinned alive , fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water , a dog is beaten , birds are thrown into the water ... <br /><br />This movie is more than awful ; it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made , along with another one , called ' ' Cannibal Holocaust '' or something like that . I 'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster . No one should waste their time watching it , especially when there are a lot of TRULY great movies out there , in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged.<br /><br />Fortunately , only a few people liked this - which is natural , since it 's the worst film ever - , so it was n't successful . I hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will NEVER be praised , and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films . I truly believe that everyone receives but what they give ! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ' ' humans '' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others.<br /><br />This , however , is probably my only ' ' negative '' review . I usually do n't comment on a movie if I dislike it , but this time I just could n't shut up . I had to speak the truth , because animal abuse must stop !
0 You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of " Jeopardy!".<br /><br />The saddest thing about White Men Ca n't Jump is that it had tremendous potential . For several years , I lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film ; racial tensions were high , and basketball meant everything to everyone . A film about the members of this " basketball culture " could have been very interesting , but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men Ca n't Job left something to be desired.<br /><br />The movie 's sequence of events is cyclical . First , Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball . He then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend ; and the process is repeated . Most stories build up to a climax of some kind , but the " climax " I saw was just another sequence in this repetition ( this case being " Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball").<br /><br />In order for a plot to develop , some dilemma must be resolved ; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well . Apparently the writers of White Men Ca n't Jump forgot this rule , as the plot can be summarized as " Billy needs to pay the bills . " I appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies , but -- I 'm sorry -- this was just plain awful . I could have cared less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment.<br /><br />Despite all this , White Men Ca n't Jump is a successful film . Apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them . Others , I 'm sure , were lured by the big names playing the leading roles . This leaves me to wonder , if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors , and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse , would anyone have bothered watching this movie ? I really do n't think so.<br /><br />I'll give this movie two stars out of ten ; the extra star is for the " Jeopardy ! " scene , which kept me awake for a few minutes . Thanks , Trebek .
0 Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court . Okay , that sounds all right there . It leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story . But no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film . This movie became redundant , retarded , and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by . Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v . characters , Woody from Cheers , and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie . But after seeing his " acting performance " I have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend . His acting was as dull and poor as the movie . Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez . I have liked movies with Perez before , but I have decided that the reason I have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and did n't have that many speaking lines ( Do the Right Thing ) . But now in White Men Ca n't Jump she was made a central character with many lines , thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice . So after seeing this film ( term used loosely ) and hearing Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated I can now say that I 'm a white man and I 'm getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story apartment building .
0 This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it , the fast - moving story , an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths , etc . Funny thing is , you probably could n't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but " white " as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police . < br /><br />Nonetheless , Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players , is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />Snipes had a lot of funny put - down lines , providing much of the humor . The bad part of the film - which does n't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters . That includes Woody 's girlfriend , played by Rosie Perez . There are no really clean , nice people in this movie . For that reason , I ca n't honestly recommend the film , at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
0 Spooks is enjoyable trash , featuring some well directed sequences , ridiculous plots and dialogue , and some third rate acting.<br /><br />Many have described this is a UK version of " 24 " , and one can see the similarities . < br /><br />The American version shares the weak silly plots , but the execution is so much slicker , sexier and I suspect , expensive.<br /><br />Some people describe weak comedy as " gentle comedy " . < br /><br />This is gentle spy story hour , the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre.<br /><br />Give me Smiley any day .
0 This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling . So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer . This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope . The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds , someone is snorting heroin . If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin , then this would be a pretty good movie . Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere , someone inhaled the white powder . It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie . It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer . The lesbian stuff did n't bother me . I was looking for a movie about art . I found a movie about drug use .
0 One previous reviewer called this film " pure visual joy " I am wondering if s / he saw the same film that I did . " High Art " had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since " Seven " . One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the cliché of going to a B&B for their First Time . Of course , before they do that , one has to watch opium - den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit . Not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types , the Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start , who are well aware they 're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so . The movie also states that the Sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now . What did she do , retire at age twenty ?
0 I was never so bored in my life . Hours of pretentious , self - obsessed heroin - addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems . It 's like watching lizards molt . Even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy . If you have insomnia , rent this .
0 I often feel like Scrooge , slamming movies that others are raving about - or , I write the review to balance unwarranted raves . I found this movie almost unwatchable , and , unusual for me , was fast - forwarding not only through dull , clichéd dialog but even dull , clichéd musical numbers . Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical , lots of fantasy , some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought - provoking plot development . Individually , June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people , but ca n't carry a movie as a team . Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal . They 're both bland . I like Billy Gray , but his character is pretty one - note . The best part of the film , to me , are June Haver 's beautiful costumes and great body .
0 Wow , how bad can it get . This was seriously bad . Not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable CGI - but in acting , atmosphere and direction.<br /><br />The story was dreadful - the character arc of the main lead was a total joke . Within a few nights of stalking Vinnie Jones , he starts to become ' haunted ' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend . Um ... are all New York photographers this childish , suggestible and weak ? His character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and by the very end you 'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable , and totally absurd twist his character takes.<br /><br />The gory moments were clearly just a weak , low - self - esteemed effort to jump onto the modern MTV style gore wagon - all cgi , blood yet no real emotion whatsoever . These parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting by their self - consciousness - wacky camera angles etc.<br /><br />Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea . What could have had atmosphere ( until the stupid monsters at the end ) is ruined in favour of ' look at me'style self - conscious directing . This film was n't made for and audience - it was made for a CV - a deeply selfish motive .
0 Do not bother to waste your money on this movie . Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you . If you must see a movie this weekend , go see Batman again.<br /><br />The script was horrible . Perfectly written from the random horror movie format . Given : a place in confined spaces , a madman with various weapons , a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers can not put together , and an innocent and overly curious , yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend . Mix together , add much poorly executed gore , and what the hell , let 's put some freaks in there for a little " spin " to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was horrible , and the characters unbelievable - Borat was more believable than this.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher 's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch ? ? ? I 'm in the army . We need that kind of stuff for ourselves.<br /><br />1 out of 10 , and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can .
0 I would just like it to be known , that I do not often rate movies below a 5 . I was originally very excited to see this movie . Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie . So , the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand , I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway . There 's a photographer obsessed with the missing people . Where are they going ? What 's happening to them ? One day , the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken , and becomes obsessed with the butcher , following him around , yada yada . The film had a way of sucking you in , even though the plot was highly predictable . " Oh no , it 's dark , look out behind you " I say , quite bored with the cheap thrills.<br /><br />The plot , even though predictable , was intriguing ... that is , until the end . " This was good until the end .... Then it just got silly " , says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards . And I fully agree . And here come the spoilers ... <br /><br />See , I was hoping it was some mad killer , some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism . No . It was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries . Woo . How original . How unrealistic . How dull.<br /><br />3/10 . Come on Lionsgate . You 've had amazing films , but this one sunk .
0 I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this ! I have n't seen such a bad movie for years . Omg this was a really bad movie . Splatter , is not enough to describe the unnecessary ( nearly funny ) blood scenes ) . If you did n't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween ( 2007 ) .. well this is 10 time worse . The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps.!<br /><br />I ca n't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible . Cliché all the time . ( why i must write 10lines ? i never understood this.)<br /><br />==Here comes spoilers==<br /><br />The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro . We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice . Actually those people are just missing . And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery ( well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy ) and as usual no one believes him ! what a surprise ! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher !
0 Where to start . The film started out pretty well , but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock . The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in . It just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by.<br /><br />The actors gave an average performance in this movie however , i got a bit bored of Vinny Jones constant scowling in the film.<br /><br />As the film dragged on , and take my word for it , it dragged on , it just got more and more far fetched.<br /><br / > * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * Just when i thought the film could not get any worse , towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up , just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all . It turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end . The ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was . Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones , he becomes the new killer.<br /><br />In closing , this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made . I gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie ! !
0 This was a terrible film . There was no story line whatsoever . To top it all off , when they could n't explain the blood and gore ( the only good part ) ... they threw in a few aliens ! I hate when directors ( or whatever ) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens ! Watch this film if you like . But do n't say I did n't warn you . Two things : How could Vinny say " welcome " when he did n't have a tongue ? Its a pity Mr Jones did n't have a bigger role . Second thing that bugged me , why were we shown Vinny Jones ' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid , then these have no further role . Why not ? I do n't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever . In short . Bad story . I would n't waste my time - wish I 'd have watched Mirrors instead .
0 I have heard a lot about this film , with people writing me telling me I should see it , as I am a fan of extremely bloody , gory movies . I got my hands on it almost right away , but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now . I would have been better off not remembering I even had it.<br /><br />This movie was atrocious . The worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was . I know it was a story by Clive Barker and all , and no I have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you have n't then you will be , as I was , completely clueless and utterly disappointed.<br /><br />The film begins good enough- the actors are convincing , the story interesting . The first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention . I thought the blood looked a bit bad , but seeing as it was the very first scene I did hope for improvement later on . I was wrong . < br /><br />The blood and effects are so horrible , it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that , for instance , someone could knock a person 's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer . WTF ? CGI blood ( did they even use ANY " real " blood at all ? My home made stuff looks better than any used in this film ! ) , unbelievable acts of dismemberment ( eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head ; arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are BONES all throughout our bodies ? ! ) , too - dark scenes ( every scene is either an odd yellow color , or in hidden in shadows) ... it just gets worse and worse . I found myself pointing out mistake after mistake . There 's just too much . Add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial - killer movie turns into some demonic / supernatural / monster movie at the end ... no thank you ! It should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- OK , with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer . Maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant ? Plausible , doable ... and a lot better I think than the " real " story . That could have and should have worked . Instead it became a " creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you , and unless you read the book , well ... you just wo n't ever understand it " fiasco . Tragic , what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential . If you like mindless fake blood and gore , you 'll love this . But if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it . Stay away- far , far away .
0 IT was no sense and it was so awful ... i think Hollywood have a lot of film like that ... you do n't have do watch it . people cutter or eater what should i say ... it made me sick ! oh my god ! film is about people that we do n't know but feed themselves with Humans ! they have teeths bla bla bla ... is n't that familiar ? i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie . the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful . and i should say that Bradley Cooper was totally awesome ... he 's so talented ... actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes ... let me explain it . did you ever eat tongue ? but in the film one person did it ! it was really awful ... anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes ...
0 I am not one of those people who just go online after I see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made . If you doubt me , please look at my other reviews . However , for the first time ever , I have seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over.<br /><br />I LOVE bad movies . To me , Ed Wood is a genius , I thought Bloody Murder , Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good . However , there is not a single good thing I can say about this film.<br /><br />The plot is basically non existent . If someone reading my review wastes their money to see it , they can discern for themselves what the plot might be , but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie.<br /><br />The special effects are bad.<br /><br />The acting is bad.<br /><br />The two leads are attractive , but that 's all there is.<br /><br />I am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone , but I INVITE anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it . I will tell you anything.<br /><br />I love bad movies , and I love horror and I love new inventive movies . I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel ( Which some reviewers claimed this was like , but obviously they only thought so cause Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2 ) . But this may be the Number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie EVER made.<br /><br />And before you disregard this review , this is coming from someone who not only sat through the ENTIRE premiere of House of the Dead , but actually bought a copy of it .
0 OK , so I just saw the movie , although it appeared last year ... I thought that it was generally a decent movie , except for the storyline , which was stupid and horrible ... First of all , we never get to know anything about the creatures , why they appeared , wtf are they doing in our world , and really , have they been on Earth before we were or did they just come from space ? Secondly , the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created ... Really , how large could the underground for a sub station could have been ? There were only so many of those creatures , so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain , they could have just planted some tactical bombs , or maybe clear the are and a Nuke would have done the job . I know it sounds funny and it is , but I do not see the killing of people as being NECESSARY ... Thirdly , Leon acts like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones , who was way taller and bigger in stature . Then again , when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp , watching all the abominations . I mean OK , the conductor had creepy help(lol ) , but if Leon was so brave he would have gone all the way ... I mean he risks his life first , then does nothing exactly when he should have . He could have died as a hero but lives as a coward ... this might be the case , but not after showing so much braveness earlier on ... Then , the cop thing ... come on ! This was a city having a subway , I bet there must have been other cops except that lady , other police stations , this was really kind of silly ... All in all , great acting by Vinnie Jones , interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all ... By the way , what did the signs on the chest mean ? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
0 I do n't know why , but i thought i 've seen this movie before . Maybe it was the name , maybe it was the way poster looked , i do n't know . Anyway , it was quite promising in the beginning . And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments . Maybe its because i 'm not a huge fan of the horrors , and i do n't watch them a lot , but this one actually looked fresh sometimes . But the rest of it is not so good . Laughable at times . The movie is slow paced , sometimes you will get so bored you 'd forget what was the story about . Characters are not great either . All of them . The butcher is OK , seems creepy and crazy enough . Although i did n't get what were those weird looking things on his chest ( that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out - of - the - blue ) , and why he was collecting those in jars at home ? The main lead is plain . His character is really hard to believe in , and very undeveloped . But i guess that s scenarists fault . Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend ? Side cast is bad too . But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl . My god , when will women in horror movies have any brains ? Its ridiculous . The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera , tries going to police , that fails , and then she thinks of the best idea ever . Why do n't we just go and take it ! I know where the maniac lives ! Yup ! That s swell ! And then look for the camera in the bathroom ! Why not ? And then walk in the room , see a bag that was not there before , and just have a look inside . Maybe camera is there ? Not there . But loads of interesting stuff . Shiny . Mmmm . To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain . Then of course the never ending " falling while running away " trick , that really made it look bad . Then , to put the final nail into the character , in the end of the movie , she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up , screams " Noooo " like she just ripped her Gucci bag , and walks further into the wagon ... Jeez . Come on . No one else thinks its just , well , stupid ? Just awful . If her character was n't so bad , maybe the movie would get another star or two from me . And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer ( that dude in the train who the conductor killed ) , butcher vests that can protect from bullets , weird and cheap looking monsters in the end ( i did n't read Clive Barkers novel , so i have no idea where those monsters came from ) , the fact that no one cared that hundreds ( judging on the skeletons in the dungeon ) disappeared in the city , and main character that did n't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out ( he barely noticed it i guess ) . Oh , and the predictable ending . Damn , i knew the ending half way in , its just disappointing . The only reason i 'm still giving some credit to the makers , is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i 've watched past few months . Visual style is nice , some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal . ( although blood did n't look real at all ) I guess some people will enjoy it , some , like me , will watch it if there is nothing else to watch , some will absolutely hate it .
0 I heard and read many praising things about " Midnight Meat Train " , which is based on a short story written by no less than Clive Barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original " Hellraiser " that he directed himself , but so far I can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience . The most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is : nauseating ! The violence is sadistic and extreme , which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts , but it 's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative . Normally speaking , I 'm very pro - violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose . The butchering  literally  depicted in " Midnight Meat Train " is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs , and even that is n't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects . There are more shortcomings , some even bigger than the pointless gore , but perhaps I should focus on the good elements first . The basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences ( like the chase in the freezer room , for example ) are literally oozing with nail - biting suspense and macabre atmosphere . Unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted . Presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities , but I honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by Vinnie Jones . The plot introduces Leon , an aspiring photographer in New York whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures . Leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train . Leon 's right , as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer , but the killer 's motivations and behavior suggest there 's something far more substantial going on the rails at night . " Midnight Meat Train " takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs , plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images ( like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood ) , but director Ryûhei Kitamura ( " Versus " , " Godzilla Final Wars " ) does n't take full advantage of it all . The ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and , even if Clive Barker meant to have like this , I still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale . " Midnight Meat Train " is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film , but not without defaults . It 's not intended for easily offended viewers , but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well .
0 Loved the original story , had very high expectations for the film ( especially since Barker was raving about it in interviews ) , finally saw it and what can I say ? It was a total MESS ! The directing is all over the place , the acting was atrocious , the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat , empty and completely unnecessary ( what s up with the generic music video techniques like the fast - forward - slow mo nonsense ? It was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video ) . Whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal , some are just ridiculously laughable ( the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi 's death was just stupidly funny ) . It just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense , totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more . No explanations were given whatsoever , I mean I knew what was happening only as i 'd read the story but for people who had n't it 's even more confusing as at times even i did n't know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole time.<br /><br />God , I really wanted to like this film as i 'm a huge fan of Barker 's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie , hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamura 's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- I did n't care about anyone or anything , the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source , turning it into something else entirely . Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass , but everything else was all over the place , more than disappointing . Gutted
0 The main problem with the documentary " Czech Dream " is that is n't really saying what it thinks it 's saying.<br /><br />In an audacious - I hesitate to use the word " inspired " - act of street theater , Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda , two student filmmakers from the Czech Republic , pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie : they deliberately fabricated a phony " hypermarket " ( the Eastern European equivalent of Costco or Wal Mart Super Store ) , built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards , radio and TV spots , an official logo , a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many " dopes " would show up to their creation on opening day . They even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed.<br /><br />One might well ask , " Why do such a thing ? " Well , that 's a very good question , but the answer the filmmakers provide is n't all that satisfying a one . Essentially , we 're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something that 's not true - simply through the power of advertising . And the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the " real " ( i.e. higher ) purpose for the charade is to convince the Czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the European Union . Fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers , all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of " research " into what does and does not work in advertising . In a way , by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments , these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse.<br /><br />But , in many ways , the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target , it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it . For it is THEY THEMSELVES and NOT the good - hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here , as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people , some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot . And what is all this supposed to prove anyway ? That people are " greedy " because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains ? Or that they 're stupid and gullible because they do n't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised ? Such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world.<br /><br />No , I 'm afraid this smart - alecky , nasty little " stunt " only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots . And , indeed many of them , when they finally discover the trick that 's been played on them , react with a graciousness and good humor I 'm not sure I would be able to muster were I to find myself in their position.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the movie is n't gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but , when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red - faced and empty - handed to their homes , we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed .
0 Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film , especially the " film makers were then attacked " aspect that the case seems to emphasize , what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob.<br /><br />Then , to watch the film and discover , oh , what they mean by " the film makers were attacked " was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said " Someone should beat those two kids up . " The picture on the cover , " the chase " as it were ? Total fabrication . Which I guess ties in with the theme of the film , lying and manipulation to satisfy vain , stupid children with more money and time then sense.<br /><br />I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film . It 's like Michael Moore 's " Roger & Me " , but if " Roger & Me " was Moore mocking the people of Flint . It 's completely misdirected and totally inane . Wow ! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of Communism would be really excited to have markets full of food ? What jerks ! And it 's not so much , " Look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah " , since it was n't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors , it was that , as many people in the film say , the prices were absurdly low , someone mentions that they should 've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck . That 's not proving anything except that people who are poor , will go to a store that has low prices , bravo fellas , way to stick it to the people on the bottom.<br /><br />Way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people . You should be very proud . How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then , say , " HAHA ! NO SUCH HOUSE EXISTS ! YOUR SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE LIED TO BY THE MEDIA!".<br /><br />Morgan " Please Like Me " Spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it 's no surprise since Spurlock as One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague .
0 This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II . I was under ten years of age . And that 's the audience this serial is designed for . Looking at it now , one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity . The budget must have been next to nothing , given the shortcuts and repeats . The acting ? Well , this is Republic pictures , 1944 . They read the lines .... and no doubt had one take to make them convincing.<br /><br />One and half stars .
0 I had high hopes for this film , because I thought CLEAN , SHAVEN ( Kerrigan 's first feature ) was absolutely terrific , the most assuredly cinematic low budget film I 'd ever seen.<br /><br />But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is utterly pointless and flat . Scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix , without much thought for narrative or character.<br /><br />Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not ? Hard to tell . Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life ? Why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle ? Why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color ? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others ? The filmmaker does n't seem to know.<br /><br />It feels as if everything is improvised ( though I understand this was n't the case ) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary.<br /><br />After the screening I saw , Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative . It sounded like learned rhetoric . I think it was a cop - out.<br /><br />I am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as CLEAN , SHAVEN would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old " political " cliches .
0 Probably the worst film I 've ever seen , the acting and story were terrible and I almost fell asleep . The only good actor was Colm Meaney . I had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end , no emotion , no charisma ... nothing !
0 This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With . Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent , stayed up late to do so , was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 % romance,4 % everything else , 1 % history if that . It 's what I call a bait and switch movie , one with an interesting title , the actual movie is a scam . This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment , this movie is almost an insult to those who served . The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes , they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France . And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter 's character . Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls , an individual such as the one portrayed here would n't have lasted two days , it would have either been the stockade or the infantry . Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce . In short , another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment .
0 If this movie was about a fictional character , the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively . Unfortunately for the viewer , the movie is based on " facts " that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter . Many of the smaller facts were disregarded ( Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders , there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth ) , but some of the larger facts , like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of " racist " judges , is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape , and completely disrespectful to Giardello . Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who , at best , was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be ( was arrested multiple times for beating women ) is strange to me . Ruben Carter was never , by viewing his actions in the 60 's and even now , when he refuses to speak to his son , a person that people can look up to . Everyone knows that Jewison can direct , and Washington can act , but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me . Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable ? ( Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself ? Now that s inspirational ) Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie , I would suggest passing on this one .
0 When I saw this movie I heard all the hype , and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent . I was wrong . I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community ( if they are not African Americans themselves ) . I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won . Sometimes this is true ( not as much nowadays ) because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture . The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was , is because people see a movie about the ( * SEMI - SPOILER * ) hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor , but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever . I was bored with him in the movie , and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good . The audience is supposed to leave believing this man , Rubin Carter , is a saint . People left the movies worshipping this man , this hero , and they went out and bought his book , making this hero of a man rich.<br /><br />*SPOILERS * This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit . Of course the crimes he did commit ( stealing mostly ) was only to survive , nothing more . People felt sorry for him , even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society . Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint ( except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife ) but why would n't it - after all , it is his point of view . I do not like movies ( especially Hollywood interpretations ) that are based on " true " stories because they usually distort the " true " parts into something else , something not so true . This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction , yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably . Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions , and he was a very violent man . Not only that , there is still a possibility that he did murder those people . If you do not believe me , search for him on the internet , and read the articles some people have of him . The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily , was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it . Besides that , there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie . The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their " nice and perfect " persona looked difficult to keep up.<br /><br />This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully . Denzel 's acting is stale , and the supporting cast 's Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying . The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring .
0 Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.<br /><br />Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie . Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie , giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes . That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.<br /><br />So first it confuses you and then it puts you off . The dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve.<br /><br />Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers . Granted , it does that so if you are looking for that ... knock yourself out .
0 This movie looks like it was made for TV . For years I waited for some movie to be made about Rubin Carter , because I loved to see him box at the old MSG , and to see this movie was very disappointing . I have alot of respect for Mr Washington , but he was awful and boring . There is really nothing good to say about this movie except I did like the song .
0 Fairly good movie , but not a true story.<br /><br />Rubin " Hurricane " Carter was a notorius liar , a murder and was never found not guilty . New Jersey State just did n't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone . Carter got an offer in 1976 : " Pass a lie test and go free " . He did n't take it . This film should never have been made , but money talks . A lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white . Why choose a fake story?<br /><br />Jens
0 This is an OK film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling.<br /><br />The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none , also no real suspense.<br /><br />Washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it , there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast.<br /><br />The story simply falls a little flat , even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact , you do n't really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare.<br /><br />There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships Carter but this seems forced.<br /><br />It 's an OK film but instantly forgettable .
0 Second - tier American leading man Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this Spaghetti Western  which , having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine ( though featuring a nice enough score ) . The plot offers some mild interest : the title , incidentally , refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun - runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer , cavalry agent Madison . The latter 's younger siblings are determined that the injured party , now in their charge , lead them to the gang boss responsible ; ultimately , the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both , ironically , become involved with one of Madison 's sisters ( another is raped during the raid ) . Euro - Cult starlet Rosalba Neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess , and Madison 's ex - flame .
0 As far as Spaghetti Westerns go , I 'd put This Man Ca n't Die on the dull side of the genre . It 's not that the movie is particularly bad , but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I 've seen . Guy Madison does his best in the lead role , but lacks the on - screen charisma necessary to pull it off . With one notable exception , the rest of the cast is n't particularly good . The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I have n't seen before . There 's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri . She 's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film . Unfortunately , her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes . ( Note : The IMDb page for This Man Ca n't Die is wrong . Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson . Instead , she is the character Melin . I 'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb 's credits for the movie . )
0 TYSON < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format : Stereo < br /><br />Reverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson . Given his conviction on a rape charge , the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain , but paints a warts - and - all portrait of his rise to fame , the pressures of success , and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad . Constrained by time limits , the script gallops through a succession of relevant details , alighting briefly on significant events , culminating with Tyson 's ( temporary ) downfall in 1995 . Novices will be enlightened by the chronology , while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel 's straight - arrow approach to the material . He portrays Tyson 's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success . In fact , the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson 's ex - wife Robin Givens , characterising her as an ungrateful gold - digger who took advantage of his naivety . Production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb : Michael Jai White does a fair imitation of the title character ; George C. Scott plays Tyson 's mentor Cus D'Amato through acres of gritted teeth ; and Paul Winfield was surely born to play Don King !
0 A very ordinary made - for - tv product , " Tyson " attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect , fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing , and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes Tyson even remotely interesting . A lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans .
0 This film was on late at night when I saw it . It was interesting at start but it did n't convince me as a whole . I am no Tyson fan . In fact I do n't like boxing at all . It 's barbaric , obscene and double faced ( by society ) that some get money for beating each other up.<br /><br />Nevertheless , I felt the start of the film was OK . Actors alright , especially George C. Scott ( as Cus D'Amato ) . I do n't know how reliable the flick is . I have n't read books and books about boxing or Tyson . I do n't know anything about the man , but it was quite entertaining.<br /><br />As the movie went on I felt it lost a little of it 's charm and I also lost interest . I managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough .
0 I know it 's a Power - Rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie ? If they are going to write a plot with crayons , at least have the decency to make it silly . It 's kind of hilarious if you watch this . We have a typical family filled with cliched characters ( father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL ) , air - head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting , and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space . Funny stuff!<br /><br />However , the real great moment comes near the end when war - dad and bad - acting - villain try to work a sword fight , but then they realize none of them know how to ( probably because no room in budget for choreographers ) , so they come up with this American Gladiator type setting to run around in . LOL.<br /><br />1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously .
0 While the overall idea of Escape from Atlantis was intriguing , I found the film to be far less than what I had hoped for upon reading the plot summery . Perhaps I am too much of a child in the technological age : the movie was made , as it is now 2002 , an official five years ago --after viewing fantasy epics such as Lord of the Rings , and science fiction feats like Star Wars , as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as Dinotopia or Homer 's The Odyssey.<br /><br />My beef , basically , is that I could n't relate --I am just about the same age of the children ( a young adult ) , and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle - aged man if that is the character available . But the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence . I did n't find myself saying ' ACK ! I would have done the SAME thing ! ' . It did not open the doors to my imagination . Even without comparing it to high - budget films or other TV movies , standing alone , certain aspects of the feature I found to be cliche : The character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking , seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish - teenager - bitter - after - divorce image changing into the we're - a - big - happy - family - let's - never - separate - again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run . Even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement : a typical set of one or the other stereotypes . There was the ever - present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious , accompanied by Mr. Perfect image of combining athletics , good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude , and lastly the smart - aleck little brother we find to be so common these days . While I know the personalities pushed the story along , I think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable --and believable ( as far as character)-- movie.<br /><br />I do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design --that made it worth finishing to the end for me . Do n't get me wrong : all movies are worth seeing for yourself , and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many , but I think that with a little more depth to the script , and a little more ( I can not believe I am saying this ) realness I dare say Escape from Atlantis could have been magical .
0 You got ta love the cheesy low budget movies . This one comes complete with bad effects , props and bad acting ( really bad ) . Plus , every time I see Mercedes McNab ( the sister ) I keep thinking ' Watch out ! She 's a vamp!"- for those that know Buffy / Angel.<br /><br />A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick , the little that was spent of course . I do n't know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who did n't make back any money.<br /><br />I'd say it 's good for little kids in it 's simplicity , but I do n't know if I 'd want to subject a kid to it ... <br /><br />umm ... 1/10 because that 's the lowest it will go .
0 Over several years of looking for half - decent films to rent for my kids , I 've developed a sixth - sense for spotting the really cheesy , direct - to - video efforts that are really painful to sit through ( for anyone over the age of eight ) . I dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me " what did she say that for ? " and " why did he do that ? " and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes . And the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply " bringing realism " to a film , please run them through with a dull butter knife . " Prehysteria ! " was head and shoulders above this . Arrgh .
0 honestly , where can I begin ! This was a low budget , HORRIBLY acted film , it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was ! the sword fighting scenes were n't even sword fights , they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal - mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling ! ! Me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day , so we decided to go to the store and look for one , and there it was The Sawtooth Island movie . I mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home I practically died after the first scene.<br /><br />Oh and the plot of the film , the story board , the script , etc .. was a bunch of garbage that I do n't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it ! ! But if you happen to stumble upon this movie .. do not get it ! ! ! ! !
0 The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine . All I can say is , it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film . As far as I could tell , Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it . The other performances were so uniformly terrible , I am amazed a studio would actually pay the " performers " to appear . Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled , and you have a perfect cinematic disaster . Obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children , and to its credit , it was better than most of the original programing on the Disney Channel and similar kid - focused networks . But honestly , that is not saying much .
0 Skullduggery is a strange , strange film based on the novel " Ye Shall Know Them " by Vercors . To unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind , since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity , and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance . But in spite of its honourable intentions and its well - meaning tone , Skullduggery simply is n't a very good film . For me , the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which ca n't make its mind up how best to convey its message . The first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the Tarzan ilk ; later it teeters into sci - fi fable ; by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics . The differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great , too jarring , to overlook . They stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you 're watching a muddled , disorganised movie.<br /><br />An archaeological expedition into the jungles of New Guinea is led by adventurer Douglas Temple ( Burt Reynolds ) . One of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist Dr Sybil Greame ( Susan Clark ) . After an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape - like creatures . These primitive , long - lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man . There is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the " missing link " in the evolution of apes into humans . Or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual ? Or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics ? The archaeologists call the tribe " the Tropi " and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery . But things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen ( Paul Hubschmid ) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers . He questions whether the Tropi are truly " human " and takes his argument to the courts , where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued.<br /><br />This was a very early film in Reynolds ' career , and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he 's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously . Not that Reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role , asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick . His character and the film are not relevant to each other . Clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist , and there are nice supporting roles for British actors Edward Fox , Alexander Knox and Wilfrid Hyde - White . A major shortcoming in Skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make - up used to give the Tropi their strange hairy appearance . Rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids , the stuck - on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical  . and that 's just not the right idea . We 're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures , but that 's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing . Skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant , philosophical and stimulating . The honourable intentions are there for all to see , but the end result does n't do them justice . A worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless .
0 Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book named " Little Fuzzy " which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet . Mr. Piper died in 1964 , but Hollywood and many of today 's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold . This is the book where they got the idea for Ewoks from.<br /><br />Skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of " Little Fuzzy " I can wonder why I 'm the only who 's ever noticed?<br /><br />But do n't take my word for it . Here 's a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of " Little Fuzzy " for free : http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
0 Taped this late night movie when I was in grade 11 , watched it on fast forward . I sugest you do the same . I though it would be and action film , but went to a cort tv type movie . In the end it fits in with the early 70 's social activest type films . Glad I missed that era . 2/10
0 This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian . We grow good wine . Our writers and poets are among the world 's best . The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world . BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES ! This one is n't especially bad . It 's especially typical and typically bad , shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction , high school level acting and " gee whiz ... lets see what this button on the camera does ? ? " photography . If Michael Moriarity was so intent on doing a Jack Nicholson impersonation , could n't he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson impersonation ? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver , truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building ( part of the " plot " ) why in God 's name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle ? ? ? Not only am I mad about this film , I 'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed . The Australians turn out some splendid stuff . We produce pretentious second rate piffle . Gawd ! ! ! ! !
0 Saw in on TV late last night . Yeah , I can hear what y' all say about this one . It IS likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical TV soap series . In all fairness , the story line does have a fine twist to it , and you might nod saying , " Well , that 's not what I expected . " But , as a film , well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element . Casting , acting , camera work , cars , costume , setting , script , no , there 's nothing to congratulate . Rated R ? ? Oh , that scene . Did we need it ? This is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched . And what was the title again ?
0 The various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used . If Ms. Pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer.<br /><br />Otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical Canadian movies . As other reviewers have pointed out Canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value , which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get . Perhaps Canadian movie producers are consciously trying to " de - commercialize " their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing ....
0 This was a truly bad film . The character " Cole " played by Michael Moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped , the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil , it did n't . After about 20 minutes I had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance , this would have added some sincerity.<br /><br />- 1 ) badly acted - 2 ) unsympathetic characters - 3 ) razor thin plot line < br /><br />Yuck!<br /><br / >
0 I really felt cheated after seeing this picture . It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing . I do n't understand what they were thinking when they made this . It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending . It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel . It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos . It ends suddenly , and you know there 's going to be another episode next week . It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie . There are many possibilities for what went wrong here ; they got lazy , they ran out of money , they did n't know the rest of the story , they wanted to make a Dahmer 2 . After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate . I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods . All of a sudden I hear this music playing , then writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 . Wow , he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail . How about showing how he got there . How about showing Dahmer 's trial . How about showing some more detail . I ca n't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place . I actually found myself saying in disbelief , " That 's it , that 's the end ? " I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made . To the filmmakers I 'd like to say , if you 're going to do it , do it right .
0 Dahmer , a young confused man . Dahmer , a confusing movie . Granted , I had a few beers while watching the movie , but that does n't explain why I got so bored by this flick.<br /><br />Its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying , and there 's no real storyline with a beginning and an end , the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie . The inbetween stuff , which would be the movie , is just boring images and a waste of time . < br /><br />We never see actual murders , everything is just a bunch of insinuations . Sometimes you even just get a feeling that Dahmer 's dreaming the entire thing , but you know he is n't , since it's < br /><br />based on a true story and this actually happened , at least most of it . But what happened ? It 's not easy to tell.<br /><br />I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie . I < br /><br />didn't like it one bit and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended . < br /><br />*/ * * * * *
0 I 'm a big fan of the true crime genre , but I could n't sit through this putrid piece . It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotica , down to the porn - flic soundtrack . There was no look at what made Dahmer tick , no exploration of who his victims were . Nothing but " Look at how creepy this guy is . " And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen .
0 Prior to watching " Dahmer , " I thought no movie could be worse than " Freddy Got Fingered . " I was wrong . To sum " Dahmer " up , it 's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer 's encounters with gay men before they were killed . There is no plot to be found , and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about " Dahmer . " All you 'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men . Horrible acting , horrible directing , horrible writing , horrible everything ... If you have to choose between watching " Dahmer " and projectile vomiting for three hours , go with the vomiting .... it wll be less painful .....
0 This movie had so much potential . Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it 's ridiculous . Too much time and effort was spent in the movie on Dahmer 's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption . Where was the character development ? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception . Where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals ? Instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer , but fail to address the major point in Dahmer 's development . Also , the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this ; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh , etc . I could go on , but to sum up , too many lagging points in the film , focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is " Dahmer . "
0 Well , it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but I feel I must say something . I was n't exactly looking for ' a splatterfest ' as someone puts it or even ' blood and guts / gore ' . I have some respect for the victims relatives although I really felt the filmaker DIDN'T. -They were nameless , faceless and meaningless . Just a vessel for Dahmers sexual antics.<br /><br />I watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think ' What makes a guy be a serial killer ? ' as well as wondering the specifics about the Dahmer story , of which I know very little . People here seem to think that the movie did n't have to cover the events of the Dahmer story .. I.E. his history , what happened when he got caught , the aftermath , etc but IT IS IMPORTANT ! You see , I assume if you are American you WILL KNOW all of this . We do not all live in America . To tell this story about such a man as he obviously was , REQUIRES that at least SOME of the history and actual events are told / shown . This does n't mean blood and guts , there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore . Without even touching upon some of what he did ( I found out more about him reading the user comments on this site ! ) , the movie felt like a void . A moment in time with very little substance . I would like to know if there is a film about the REAL Dahmer because with its lack of direction , VERY slow pace that NEVER changes , Strange portrayal of homosexuality and the VERY unfortunate lack of ANY attempt at an ending , this movie is POOR . I would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it . A definite 1 out of 10 ( for the acting ! )
0 I do have the ` guts ' to inform you to please stay away from ` Dahmer ' , the biographical film based on the real - life story of the grotesque serial killer . ` Dahmer ' strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject . Jeffrey Dahmer , who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts , was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation . However , the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful ` dahm ' project . This is not an easy film to digest , even though Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery ` brainsadillas ' appetizers or even some real - life ` Mr. Potato skins ' . * Failure
0 Way to go ace ! You just made a chilling , grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft , mellow , drama . Obviously a movie called Dahmer would be one of two kinds : Horror , or documentary right ? This was neither . It was n't close to any detailed facts , ( in fact it barely had any substance at all ) It was n't really morbid or scary or did n't even try to be very disturbing.(as if you would 've had to try ! ! ) What the hell was this writer / director thinking ? ? Here 's one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot , poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent 's house . I think Jacobson was actually trying to present ( or invent ) ' the soft side ' of j . Dahmer .
0 Curiosity led me to this " masterpiece " . Unfortunately , I did n't rent it , I bought it ! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it 's not so disturbing . For reasons known only to them , the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer . Are you kidding me ? The man gave new meaning to the term " finger lickin ' good " ! And with all the flash - backs and flash - forwards I had trouble following the story . All in all Jeremy Renner 's performance was n't too bad . You can catch him in " S.W.A.T. " , in which he plays a disgruntled ex - cop . Anyway , I would rate this as a 1/10 . It only got a 1 because of Renner 's so - so performance . There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer 's crimes . Avoid this one .
0 It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of America 's most notorious serial killers , but sadly it does n't even come close . Terrible editing , direction , bad acting , you name it . This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 . The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father , but that 's not nearly enough to save this stinker . A 1 out of 10 .
0 " Dahmer " is an interesting film although I would n't use " horror " or " thriller " do describe it . It 's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer , who drugged , murdered and dismembered his male victims . The film centers on the relationship between Dahmer and " Rodney " , well - played by Artel Kayàru . < br /><br />Rodney is almost the more interesting character : enamored of Dahmer and having once escaped an attack , he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack.<br /><br />I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer 's formative years , how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer 's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims.<br /><br />The roles are well played but the story is thin .
0 Disappointing and undeniably dull true - crime movie that has poorly cast character actor Jeremy Renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer , who was easily one of the last century 's most recognizable degenerates / serial killers . Released straight - to - video back in early 2003 , " Dahmer " is an overtly talky , boring , badly acted and virtually bloodless snore - fest of a true - crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do ! What it does , however , attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely , nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin ' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold , calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was ! Overall , 2003 's " Dahmer " is one that true - crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because I 'm not kidding when I say that it 's one of the worst serial - killer biopics ever done ! It 's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight - to - video trash like " Gacy " , " Bundy " , " Ed Gein " and " The Night Stalker " ! ( Turkey - Zero Stars )
0 What about Dahmer 's childhood?- The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body ? What about " infinity land " ? - The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another , suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger . What about the relationship between his parents , and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father ? His feelings of neglect when his brother was born ? What about his fascination with insects and animals ? How he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?What about focusing more on his cannibalism ? And what about his parent 's divorce ? These are all things that should have been included in the film . Instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down ' snapshot ' from a night or two in his life , and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks , to events that were n't even particularly relevant to our understanding of Dahmer.<br /><br />Why did n't the film maker show how Dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people ? He could have made this point many times , particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them ( which actually took place in a health club , not a night club ) . Instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind.<br /><br />Whilst I appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes ( or however long ) , but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with Luis Pinet ? ( known as Rodney in this film ) . My only guess is that the director was trying to build up Pinet 's character , to try and make us fear for or empathise with him , but this film is supposed to be about Jeffrey Dahmer , so why could n't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else ? If the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough , but it was n't . The scene in which he kills Steven Hicks , his first victim , is a vital part of the Jeffrey Dahmer story because it was the first killing , and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life . Unfortunately the film does n't explain that it was his first killing , or that he did n't kill again for nine years . We assume , because his hair style is different , and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback , but to when ? And why ? < br /><br />What about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career ?- one of the most important clues we have towards understanding Dahmer and his motivations .. <br /><br />Some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal , but having studied Jeffrey Dahmer in depth , it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed . Why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on Jeffrey Dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued?<br /><br />Finally , a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate , not a 15 . We needed to see his perversion in more depth , to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us . That does n't mean showing the drill actually entering Konerak Sinthasomphone 's head for instance , but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed , and what his Modus Operandi was when actually killing . Anyone watching this film who does n't know the story of Dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people . He actually killed seventeen men.<br /><br />Aside from the facts and lack of depth , the film is n't all bad . There is some nice cinematography , and good performances from the two main characters . I 'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge , more energy , and a better reason for making the film in the first place .
0 I was so disappointed in this movie . I do n't know much about the true story , so I was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history . With such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination . Well , somewhere the screenplay failed them . It was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood ? his love life ? his own disability ? his speaking ability ? his passion for the disabled ? I 'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story , but this movie was n't it . I was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities , but because of their personalities . Other small gripes : 1 . The heavy - handed soundtrack . It 's the seventies - WE GET IT ALREADY ! 2 . If he 's such a phenomenal public speaker , why were n't we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages ?
0 I just watched this movie in high definition on television . I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating . His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society 's job market is great . And my problem is n't with the real person who did these things . HE was a great man . But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching , that I found it insulting.<br /><br />First of all , they did n't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability . Sure they were competent actors , but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film . Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches , appearing to have only one leg . But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful . What ? They could n't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film ? For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee ? At that point in the film I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that I came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple I am.<br /><br />Figure that out .
0 I find it heart - warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM , American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low - budget exploitation horror film like this . Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers , Messiah of Evil has potential , but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it ca n't muster the film - making prowess to pull it off.<br /><br />The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back . It does n't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror.<br /><br />The surreal non - sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the ' blood moon ' , a scruffy and half - mad alcoholic ( played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie ) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley ' eaten by dogs ' a little later , the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father 's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded , murderous , squirrel - eating albino.<br /><br />Part of the movie 's charm is precisely this brand of bargain - basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way . Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator , with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the ' intentional ' , the ' unintentional ' and the ' did n't really expect it to come out this way but it 's good enough - WRAP SCENE ' blur hopelessly.<br /><br />Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug - addled , feverish , stream - of - consciousness way , one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father , and the other narrated by her father 's voice as she reads his diary . < br /><br />While we 're still talking about a ' living dead ' picture , Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be . The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse , bestowed upon the town by a mysterious ' Dark Stranger ' who came from the woods one day . In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass - consumption criticism in a flesh - eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years ( you can hear the MST3 K line already : ' man is dead , only his capitalist food tins remain ' ) and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater.<br /><br />I generally think that the surreal works in careful , well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it 's not hidden within the perfectly normal ? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand . When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her , you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience , amused and satisfied with his own hijinks . < br /><br />The general film - making level is also pretty low - after the half - way mark , the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either . Add to that the choppy editing , average acting and Hyuck 's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and I 'd file Messiah under ' missed opportunity ' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it 's not particularly gory , trashy or sleazy .
0 This is one of those " so bad it is good " films that you always hear about but never see ! Unlike Troma films which are deliberately bad and campy ( and I am not amused ) this one is 100 % pure serious.<br /><br />However with features such as a supposedly super - lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the Good Witch of the East the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining.<br /><br />Watcheable enough because of that .
0 The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students ... to learn how NOT to make a film!<br /><br />Let 's see ... what did the crew mess up in this flick ? Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script WORST ALL - TIME DIRECTING Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst sets Worst lighting Etc . Let 's face it , if this " film " had been in ultra - high contrast black - and - white , AND silent ... it still would have been awful . All scenes are dark ( lighting people call it " black " ) , often , the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs , which was OK because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect . The " evil " robot was hilarious ... what was that ? Jazz dancing ? Oh ... I guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something . I 'm sure it struck fear into the hearts ... of the poor editors . And , how do you edit so much footage of garbage ? Not possible . Garbage is garbage , no matter how you splice it . How did anyone ever get this thru the dailys???<br /><br />Bottom line is- I could n't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments , it was so bad ... but I did see the whole thing ( with lotsa breaks ) just to see if it had ANY good parts in it at all . NOPE ! NONE!<br /><br />A perfect example of how not to make a flick ... a must see for EVERY serious film student ! ! !
0 A terrible movie containing a bevy of D - list Canadian actors who seem so self - conscious about the fact they are on - camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.<br /><br />This film is badly written , badly edited , and badly directed . It is disjointed , incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way . McDowell does a great job with what he is given , but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with . It 's not even camp enough to be funny.<br /><br />I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner , and even the sub - characters like Eisen ( with his nasal , whiny voice ) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.<br /><br />Didn't the director see that the ' creature ' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit ? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske 's orange wisps of ' magic ' ( ! ? ! for lack of a better word ) , is obviously the result of bad actors , with no choreographer , overlaid with completely derivative special effects . Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film ( not the good kind ) ? < br /><br />Learn from the mistakes of others ... do n't even waste your time with this one , you 'll regret it like I did . I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid .
0 Terrible use of scene cuts . All continuity is lost , either by awful scripting or lethargic direction . That villainous robot ... musta been a jazz dancer ? Also , one of the worst sound tracks I 've ever heard ( monologues usually drowned out by music . ) And ... where 'd they get their props ? That ship looks like a milk carton ... I did better special effects on 8 mm at the age of 13!<br /><br />I'd recommend any film student should watch this flick ( 5 minutes at a time ) so as to learn how NOT to produce a film . Or ... was it the editors ' fault?<br /><br />It 's really too bad , because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just poorly executed all the way around . ( Sorry Malcom . You should have sent a " stunt double " . You 're too good an actor for such a stink - bomb . )
0 If Mr Cranky had rated this , I 'd be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here . But as he has n't , I 'll have to give it a go myself.<br /><br />The only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall 's acting is excellent . However not even he can save this film from disaster . The director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad ' 70 's movies . Even worse , both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was.<br /><br />It 's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the Proxate Corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container / slave ship to Nigeria . This ship 's computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via USB 12 or something . The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name.<br /><br />I honestly ca n't find one scene that I could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie . I only watched it to the end as I had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular . I wo n't hold this against him as he 's a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie.<br /><br />So , unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you 're male and you 're doctor is n't doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you 're really community minded , buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster .
0 Malcolm McDowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different . Especially designed for people who like Yellow filters on their movies .
0 There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie . One reason are some of the actors ( like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh ) work , who tried to play at their usually good level of acting . However at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting.<br /><br />The other reason is the cool idea and looking of the Cyborg , which is quite different to most other such roles I 've seen so far.<br /><br />Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be . Boring scenes , useless and boring dialogs , bad script work . And it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors . It could have been an interesting story though , but they failed completely .
0 This is probably one of the worst movies ever made . Bad acting , bad special effects , bad plot , bad everything . In the last 15 minutes a cat suited - cyborg is introduced which muddles everything . Malcom MacDowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill . I just don"t know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning . I could have done better special effects in my bathtub . There 's no continuity . The editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad . Acting . Do they have to smoke to be bad . ? The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets , make up your mind . The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing . Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake . It has nothing to do with the movie
0 This movie is absolutely pointless , one of the good esamples how Malcom McDowall never got one decent role after Clockwork Orange . This one may be one of the worst though . No story , crappy special effects , shot in 4:3/or even worse cropped on DVD , just avoid it ....
0 Shown in Australia as ' Hydrosphere ' , this incredibly bad movie is SO bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end , just to see if it could get any worse ... and it does ! The storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class , the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures , and the acting is wooden.<br /><br />The infant ' muppet ' seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of ' Total Recall ' . There did n't seem to be a single , original idea in the whole movie.<br /><br />I found this movie to be so bad that I laughed most of the way through.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame . He obviously needed the money !
0 This is certainly the worst movie i ever saw ? The beginning is somewhat good , but the end ? I still do n't even get it ! Magical power , 300 years later , goddess , dancing what the f * * * is that about ? ? ? The acting is somewhat not so bad .. but some place I could do better for sure !
0 I wish I could say that this show was unusual in it 's banality , but it is usual in every way . It has the dumb husband , his smarter but boring and conventional wife , along with the idiotic sidekick for " comic " relief - it sorely needs it . Stale predictable jokes , with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack , punctuate this noxious mental narcotic 's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill , or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma . But it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average American a personage to which they can truly identify . A " regular " guy just like you and me . I live in the southern U.S , so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism . Down here , that obnoxious character is everywhere , in some form or another . Seeing him on television is brutal overkill .
0 The show is average . It does n't make me laugh particularly . However , I think Courtney really brings it down . She does n't look natural . She has these three ways to talk , all robotic . She talks quietly ( with no intonation ) , she talks normally ( with no intonation ) , or she does that thing where she starts talking normally , and starts yelling gradually . However , her yelling is like " let 's pretend I 'm yelling because I should n't be too loud on the set " . < br /><br />She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing . It 's annoying . You ca n't really get her personality , because she does n't really produce emotion , and does n't get upset . She has this husband , who 's doing all these stupid things , and there is no reaction from her . Very dry and plain acting .
0 You need to watch this show once to have seen them all , the formula is exactly the same in each episode . Jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife , at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her , she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully . In fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that I 'll take a stab at one now.<br /><br />Episode ' Valentines Pay'<br /><br />Jims wife notices that all of Jims weekly pay has disappeared , he then explains to her he lost it at the casino . She screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is . Then on Valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a Ball ( hence explaining the missing wages ) . She realizes ' Her ' mistake and the usual ' Oh Jim , you 're so lovely ' . .. The end < br /><br />Another very obvious item is the fact that Jims character is based on Homer Simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant , when this is attempted with Human beings it does not work and Jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk . < br /><br />IMO the only reason that this is successful is simply because we 're so many now in terms of Human beings with TVs , these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you 'd get an audience.<br /><br />'Two and a half men ' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious .
0 All the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character Jim being either a bad father , a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish . How can that be funny ? Of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed , but Jim 's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner.<br /><br />And why it that ? My guess is that it 's because " he should now better " . Jim 's not a stupid guy , he can take care of things and he 's got the opportunities to do so . But he chooses not to . It 's a conscious choice he makes , when he chooses to not play with his kids , not go shopping because he does n't want to buy " lady products " and it 's a choice he makes , when he puts down his relatives.<br /><br />The other characters seems to only be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a jerk to . If the Cheryl character was a real person , she would have left him years ago , and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years . But alas , she 's just a catalyst for Jim 's quirky middle - class extreme selfishness .
0 I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink - fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it , and heavily . But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred . After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow . Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote , or even to the TV to turn the channel . But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state ? " Nuts to that " , I said . So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me . What Fate had in store was an episode of this show , an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad , general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with , and once again I was completely right ! This show is a total crud - pie ! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn . The women are physically attractive but too Stepford - is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer . There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell . < br /><br />Except .. < br /><br />Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell , America 's Greatest Comic Character Actor . This guy plays Belushi 's brother - in - law , Andy , and he is gold . How good is he really ? Well , aside from being funny , his job is to make Belushi look good . That 's like trying to make butt warts look good . But Campbell pulls it off with style . Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year . Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne - Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage . 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he 's in !
0 I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman . It is great ! When Jim tosses that little person through the window , the look on his face is priceless . Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife 's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee - Woman ? Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see . I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode . I 'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious . Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman ? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo ?
0 It must be the most corniest TV show on the air . This is probably a escape for Jim Belushi and all of his bad movies . His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother . I hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use . Jim has got to retire or something . Please let them go of the air . If i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush . I d rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing . I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running . We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim 's face . In conclusion , no more please .
0 This is the most saccharine romance I ever sat through . The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief , housedress , and ostrich - trimmed high - heeled mules to watch in the afternoon , lying on the couch eating bonbons . In fact , bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.<br /><br />The only reason I was able to watch to the end , is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves ' dreamy face in almost every scene . In most of his films , he moves too fast to get a good look . The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican , really . < br /><br />The dialog is as stiff as wood . Unfortunately , no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect - mannered and mild . The aristocratic warm - blooded old - world family cliche is as old as the hills . What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican ? This is a fairy story.<br /><br />I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for . The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women 's Day Magazine . I did n't see his name listed , but the art director surely was Thomas Kinkade , who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias . This film was literally seen through rose - colored glasses . If you like dreamy pink and blue sky , this film is for you ! ( The bonbons looked really good , too ! )
0 i think that new york is a big fake , i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid . i enjoyed flavor fl av more better , she acts like a slut , and a hoe put together . her mother is out of this world , i think she is the devils daughter . i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl . she is nasty , spoiled and a big fat fake.the show is very interesting to watch , how much money is she getting to do this awful show , and what s up with her mother , i thought her and new york did not get along , but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter.and where is the so called husband , he is no where to be found , i would not to be with them either .
0 The latest Rumor going around is that Vh1 is starting casting calls for I Love New York 3 mid 2008 . So does this mean Budah or Tailor made dumped New York or does this mean New York dumped the winner?<br /><br />I know Flavor of Love is coming up to it 's 3rd season , so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and a I love New York 3 ..... will there ever be a true winner???<br /><br />I've also heard a few rumors that Chance WILL be brought back for the 3rd Season of I Love New York ! ! ! ! I have also heard rumors that New York will be Specially featured on Flavor of Love 3 . < br /><br />Hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just stating the latest rumor .
0 " I Love New York " is another entry by VH-1 ( MTV Networks ) showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill , obnoxious , woman . It must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest , Ebonics speaking , craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network . Many will argue , " this is a show " . True , it 's not as bad as it 's previous show , " Flavor of Love " - but it 's just as bad.<br /><br />It reminds me of a skit from the 90 's show " In Living Color " where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating the boxer Mike Tyson on " The Love Connection " dating show and he picked " Robin Givens " for a date . Mike talked of how the date was okay , but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in . This show reminds me of that.<br /><br />The men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more - ( I would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto , you 'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV . ) but these are professional reality actors , so why bother.<br /><br />It escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this . The fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions ? 15 Minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network ? ( Well , you ca n't hate them for trying to make a buck . ) Maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour ? Or wonder if she and her mother 's next show would be on the WWF ! Any way you slice it , it 's a train wreck you 've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil.<br /><br />No twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck , or any different from any of the others . Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an " end " to reality shows , this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end , immediately .
0 It 's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film . But the problem is that it 's not very good . There was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented , the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you did n't bother for any of them.<br /><br />Rather bland ( and sometimes downright bad ) photo leaves a bit to be desired but I guess you ca n't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it . It 's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high - budget films . But alas , that is what one must do . On its own , it 's not very good . And compared to others , it 's still not very good . But it is not without its good points ! I liked the plot . It was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end . Sometimes in the really dark scenes , it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well.<br /><br />However in the end the film fails to impress . The characters are pretty much non - existent and we do n't care for any of them . Any of them might die , but it 's possible to pinpoint the final " survivor " from very early on .
0 I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival , and to be honest it was on of the worst films I 've ever had the misfortune to watch . Do n't get me wrong , there are the funny and entertaining bad films ( e.g " Manos  Hands of fate " ) and then there are the awful bad films . ( This one falls into the latter category ) . The cinematography was unbelievable , and not in a good way . It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus ( with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot ) , the lighting was something between " one guy running around with a light bulb " and " non existing " . The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors , and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them . The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer , a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from " Friday the 13'Th " . The Plot was extremely poor , and the ending even worse . I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like , or maybe an insomniac needing sleep .
0 Anyone who visited drive - ins in the 1950s , 60s , and 70s , must have seen a film or two by American International Pictures , a distributor that resembled 1980s giant Cannon Films . Wherever movie - goers ventured , AIP would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like ' Voodoo Woman ' and ' The Undead ; ' in the 60s were Frankie Avalon - Annette Funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like ' The Glory Stompers ; ' and into the 70s , AIP churned out grindhouse - level trash like ' Cannibal Girls ' and ' Sugar Hill.'<br /><br />'Dillinger , ' released in 1973 , is one of the more ' highbrow ' AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drive - in film - making ; it is one of those uneven , over - the - top flicks that satisfied the masses ' thirst for entertainment , craftsmanship and common sense be damned . On the whole , ' Dillinger ' is typical for its era : entertaining and worth a couple of hours , but certainly not memorable . Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact , ' Dillinger ' was a fair effort by screenwriter - director John Milius ( ' Magnum Force ' ) but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.<br /><br />The 109-minute ' Dillinger ' - epic for AIP 's scope - follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis , played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson . Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice . At large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout , including expert bankrobber John Dillinger ( Warren Oates ) , Pretty Boy Floyd ( Steve Kanaly ) , and psychopath Baby Face Nelson ( Richard Dreyfuss ) . Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson , taking along Homer Van Meter ( Harry Dean Stanton ) and Harry Pierpont ( Geoffrey Lewis ) . He also hooked up with Billie Frechette ( Michelle Phillips ) , a prostitute of French and Indian extraction . While taking place over several months in 1933 - 4 , ' Dillinger ' is basically a chase film , with Purvis 's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />'Dillinger ' has a documentary feel , listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis . Milius keeps an honest Depression look , using authentic fashion , cars , weapons , and buildings ; he also sprinkles around black - and - white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts . The film is never boring , moving at a quick , if haphazard , pace . The action scenes are Dillinger 's strongpoint , edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort . Thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film , not to mention pounds of explosives . This film is certainly not for the squeamish , with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place . The violence , while gratuitous , brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on American life.<br /><br />This film never transcends its exploitation status , however , because the needed writing just is n't there . John Milius , somewhat overrated as a filmmaker , places way too much emphasis on action . The action scenes ( mostly blood - filled shootouts ) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era , including 1967 's ' Bonnie and Clyde . ' But we simply do n't get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people ; the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon , with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward . Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline , becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling . All too often , the film takes on a shoot-'em - up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.<br /><br />Aside from this , the picture 's main crime is ignorance of historical fact . While many say that ' Dillinger ' is just a film , it 's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent . Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die , as Milius 's screenplay and the film 's documentary style encourage us to believe . In fact , Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter ; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death , nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow . While these inaccuracies might make for high drama , there is no reason why Milius could n't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.<br /><br />Warren Oates 's performance as Dillinger is quite good , although he sometimes looks unconvincing . Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his larger - than - life image in the American press ; however , we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime . Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis , suave but rather flat . Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it 's really too bad that Milius 's screenplay did n't flesh out her relationship with Dillinger . We never learn what drew her to a cold - blooded killer , other than the stereotype of an easy - going girl who is attracted to men of danger . The supporting roles with Kanaly , Dreyfuss , Stanton , Lewis , and a briefly - appearing Cloris Leachman , are acceptable for such talent.<br /><br />As a piece of 1970s exploitation , ' Dillinger ' appears doomed to retail bargain bins , which is exactly where I picked up MGM 's DVD release for $ 4.99 . The film is nicely presented in widescreen ( a must for drive - in flicks ) with subtitles in French and Spanish . Dillinger 's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra . Largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive - in enthusiasts , the film does n't really call for much else in way of supplementary material . For fans of the genre , it 's certainly worth checking out.<br /><br / > * * out of 4<br /><br />Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
0 Near the beginning , after it 's been established that outlaw John Dillinger ( Warren Oates ) , is an egomaniacal rapist , another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the FBI . Second - in - command Melvin Purvis ( Ben Johnson ) , surveys the situations , sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth , picks up two loaded .45-caliber automatics , and stalks off into the distant house alone . Bang , bang , bang . Purvis emerges alone from the house , carrying the female hostage , the miscreant dead . All in long shot.<br /><br />If you 're enthralled by stories like Red Riding Hood , this should have considerable appeal.<br /><br />Oh , it 's as exciting as it is mindless . Pretty Boy Floyd meets his demise dramatically . Multiple violations of the civic code . Plenty of shoot outs with Tommy guns and pistols . Blood all over.<br /><br />As history , it stinks . Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero , partly , I would guess , because of his name . Melvin PURVIS ? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover , who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though.<br /><br />The picture was written and directed by John Milius . He 's the guy who had it written into his contract that , should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions , he should be the designated shooter . Milius is the guy , a compleat gun freak , who had Teddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders in the Spanish - American war shouting quotations from Henry V -- " Saint Crispin 's Day " and all that.<br /><br />Exciting , yes , and complete garbage . " I knew I 'd never take him alive , and I did n't try too hard neither . " That is , kill 'em all and let God sort them out.<br /><br />You'll just love it .
0 Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place . Stale dialogue , underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe . An attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap - together attempt at recreating the magic of Arthur Penn 's Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) and George Roy Hill 's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969)- truly innovative filmmakers and films - but falling well below the bar . Problems with storylines being self - explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections . The editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically . Unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor . Stills , black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that ca n't transition well or to replace scenes that just did n't work at all and again are reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969).<br /><br />Overly dramatic pauses between sentences , random shots of surrounding scenery that was n't needed for storytelling plus over - the - top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 's - I was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post - production . The playing of music in most two shots and close - ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score . No sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots , doors , footsteps and dialogue ( a style used in the late 60 's through the mid-70 's by new directors ) but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads . In my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no ' likeable ' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story . Neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters I wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the ' hero'- a necessity for any story to work for me . We know from Penn 's and Hill 's movies who the ' heroes ' are . Even though they are criminals , we like them and want to see them get away . I could care less who was on the screen in this film . I got the impression that John Milius was trying to give off a non - historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding John Dillenger 's life from June 1933 to July 1934 ( his death).<br /><br />To be fair , there are some moments of good solid storytelling , which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits . John Milius gets better thankfully in future films where he does n't seem to try to ' copy ' other filmmakers . Dillinger ( 1973 ) is n't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial ' big budget ' debut , but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy.<br /><br / >
0 I just finished reading a book about Dillinger . This movie was horribly inaccurate . It 's like they got a list of names and just made everything up . His robberies and getaways were well planned , down to the second - when the time was up , they left whether they had all of the money or not . They had notes of every road , where to turn , etc . Purvis never saw him at the restaurant , he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left . Purvis never even SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed , only photos of him . The way his gang members died were fictitious . Dillinger never robbed a bank by himself , like he did in this movie . If I had never read the book , maybe I could have enjoyed the movie . The acting was a bit over the top in places . The action was overdone as well . On second thought , I doubt if I would have enjoyed it much even if I HADN'T read the book .
0 Once again I have seen a movie made by people that know nothing . I just recently reviewed Baby Face Nelson . Now I 've seen Dillinger and I 've had it.<br /><br />This movie is garbage . I do n't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like Bonnie and Clyde . This movie is far from a classic . Someone called it brilliant . That 's an insane thing to say . This movie ca n't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting I 've ever seen . I do n't know whose dumb idea it was to cast Warren Oates as John Dillinger . First of all he looks nothing like him . Second of all , by the time John Dillinger was killed he was 31 . When Oates made this he was 45 ! You could even tell that he 's older than the real Dillinger just by looking at him . Not only was he too old , but so was Ben Johnson as Melvin Purvis.<br /><br />They show Baby Face Nelson die , then Homer Van Meter , and finally John Dillinger . John Dillinger was killed before both of them . The last one to die out of the three was Baby Face Nelson . Not only do the writers not know when they died , but they also do n't know how they died . Baby Face Nelson was not killed after he escaped from Little Bohemia in a robe . Homer Van Meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns . Homer Van Meter was cornered by the police in St. Paul and gunned down with machine guns . Another member of Dillinger 's gang , Harry Pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie . Pierpont was n't shot . Harry Pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair . I go into what happened to Baby Face Nelson on my Baby Face Nelson review so I 'm not going to go into it again here . Let me also add that Richard Dreyfuss ' portrayal of Baby Face Nelson is pathetic . There 's a scene where he attacks Dillinger and then gets a bad beating . While Dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming , " Leave me alone ! " Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger never fought . Maybe Dillinger did n't agree with Nelson 's bank robbing methods , but they never fought . Nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten . They keep calling him Lester " Baby Face " Nelson . He was never in his life known by that name . Nelson 's real name was Lester Gillis and he changed his name to George Nelson . The black guy that escaped from jail with Dillinger was Herbert Youngblood , but in this movie he is known as Reed Youngblood . John Milius does n't know anything . Where the hell did John Milius get his information ? I could probably make a better movie than him.<br /><br />Finally the way they showed John Dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable . The movie shows Dillinger walk out of the Biograph with the Lady in Red and his girlfriend Billie Frechette . By the way , Billie Frechette was n't even there that night . But a girl named Polly Hamilton was . Melvin Purvis yells , ' Johnny ! ' Dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell . It is a proved fact that Dillinger did not have a gun that night . The FBI gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away . They did n't even have to shoot him . They were so close that powder burns were found on his face . It was murder . They also say that the man killed that night was not John Dillinger . After killing tons of civilians in the Little Bohemia incident can you imagine the FBI reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man ? The gun they had on display that was supposedly on Dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after Dillinger 's death . I could go on and on how the man they killed was n't John Dillinger , but I 'll stop here . If you would like to know more check it out here < br /><br />See the Dillinger version with Lawrence Tierney if you want , but do n't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie .
0 I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee . But then , in Poland in 2000 , I watched it in a complete form . And so what ? The plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong , straight and fundamentally severe ladies . The men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex - drive , constant masculine desire for sex , feminists who are shown like complete idiots ( you may agree with them or not , but idiots certainly they are not ) , and so on . The performance even of the stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like " I am in the elevator with a nude chick and I have n't done anything to her ! " . This was intended to be a comedy , instead , it turned out to be a vapid farce , full of predictable jokes and below - the - waist innuendos . Do not waste your time on it - this is just bad .
0 David Mackenzie 's follow - up to the brilliant Young Adam wants to be a feel - good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho - sexual issues with his dead mother . It wants to be gritty , realistic , and mysterious . At the same time , it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult.<br /><br />To meet this end , the film tries hard to be youthful . Its poster has hand - drawn letters looking like that of Juno . Its original soundtrack is comprised of fast - paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that Hallam is OK ; just a little misguided . But strangely the film is anything but youthful.<br /><br />Like Young Adam this film 's central mystery concerns a drowned woman- in this case Hallam 's mother . Young Adam keeps its mystery quiet , contemplative , and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come . Hallam Foe does the opposite . It foregrounds its character 's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters . The opening scene is Hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend . Hallam swiftly interrupts , asserting his presence in the household . Here we see everything that Hallam will do for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The mystery surrounding his mother 's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father 's girlfriend . The audience can never really trust Hallam because , besides being creepy , we think his obsession has led him close to insanity . This hindered the mystery element for me because Hallam is too sporadic to be relatable . Right when he 's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home , at first it appearing to be looking for the police . Then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother , which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element.<br /><br />While Jamie Bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character , he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs . This movie is in no way mysterious , yet it is not blunt either . It tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues , but it adds a very self - conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite . It goes for a soundtrack - heavy , Trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings , picks locks , and camps out for the sake of voyeurism . These urban peeping tom adventures Hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward - drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy , giddy , or pleasant . They are more neutral than anything ; not propelling the character or story . Mackenzie makes you understand Hallam , yet he fails to build common ground.<br /><br />He expects you to enjoy Hallam 's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification . The film hinges on its audience 's perspective on voyeurism / the kind of person who engages in it . Obviously , most people would be disgusted by it . And Hallam Foe realizes that , but it does not let us see Hallam weigh the morality of his decisions . He goes from person to person , trying to fill his deep void . There is a particularly disturbing line from Hallam 's love interest Kate where she drunkenly says " I love creepy boys , " perhaps asking the audience to do the same . The line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him ( her motivation remains vague throughout ) and tries to further us from judging him . It 's not hard to like Hallam , but it is very hard to participate in his adventure- if it is even an adventure at all . All the while , the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood.<br /><br />Great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act , muddy development , and needlessly ambiguous direction from Mackenzie . Recently this film was re - named for a US release , and for what reason ? Not only is it more unappealing , but the hard truth is that the Hallam character never earns the title ' mister . '
0 In its way , Mister Foe ( originally , and more appropriately , titled Hallam Foe  I ca n't see addressing its title character as " mister " ) , is a tribute to good acting . Both Jamie Bell , as Hallam , a physically attractive voyeur / creep , and Sophia Myles , as Kate , his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance , are convincing . The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life . A young man who spies on the intimate details of people 's lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp . And a woman in Kate 's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police.<br /><br />These things are not , however , what happens in the movie . Poor Hallam 's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he 's been having an affair . Hallam , of course , hates his stepmother and lets he know it . She has sex with him . Kate 's some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games . She looks like his birth mother . It all ends happily with Hallam " resolving " his " issues".<br /><br />Forty some years ago , the play and brilliantly acted movie , Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf , had a similarly optimistic ending , with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart . The trouble is , it does n't always work that way , especially when nobody really cares . In Virginia Woolf , the ending 's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation . In Mister Foe , the emotional revelation never really happens .
0 Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of Oedepus complex afterward.<br /><br />It is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten . There 's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops , and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo ( only he is much less sympathetic).<br /><br />There 's a strange love story involved which does n't have anything to do with anything . She happens to look like his mother , yes so what ? We know he misses his mother , that 's what the first ten minutes were about . They should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a O.K. short film . Now it 's a portrait of a character who does n't change . He is a guy that stuff happens to . The only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job.<br /><br />There 's this whole Oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character . He paints his face , dresses in women 's clothing and wears a dead Badger on his head . A Badger ! You 've got to see the ending ! He returns to his home with the badger on his head ( and it is shot like a tacky Horror film ) to kill his dad 's new wife ( which he had sex with in the beginning ) . And somehow they thought this would n't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background . I 've got to admit though , I 'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose . It feels like this MacKenzie director / guy / whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school . You are so smart ! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories ! You really dug ! What a Wallraff ! Okay so now I realized this film is based on some random book , but anyway .. <br /><br />Photowise it is boring . A lot of talking heads . Plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene , you know cold and warm etc .. why ? maybe " Hallam Foe " is both a feature and a test film for color blind people . Or maybe they just thought that the drama would n't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely , so they increased blue so that we really get it.<br /><br />I'm not even gon na comment on the cliché indie - oh - how - how - how - cute drawings they have made in the presentation . And all the " cute " sex stuff going on . This whole film is an independent cliché . But I do recommend it . I laughed more than a few times . Though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine .
0 First off ... with names like Fred Olen Ray , Brinke Stevens and Jan - Michael Vincent , plus distributors like " Rhino " and " Troma " on the video box , you know what you 're getting into with this one . B movie mania ! If you 're actually expecting to see a thriller " based on Edgar Allan Poe , " then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of Roger Corman 60s Poe films . This is pure , unadulterated sleaze ( with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to " The Premature Burial " ) , complete with lots of R - rated , ready - for - video sex and nudity . However , it 's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way ... <br /><br />Brinke ( who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes ) plays rich , traumatized , insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe , whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father ( Hoke Howell ) . Her worthless husband Terry ( Jay Richardson ) has racked up some serious gambling debt ( owed to a gangster played by Robert Quarry ) and , with help from his kinky , blonde , European - accented sexpot secretary Lisa ( Delia Sheppard ) plots to do away with Brinke for her money . Name - value actress Karen Black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist ( she 's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this ) , 50s sci - fi / horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still - living Vicki . Jan - Michael Vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo - goo eyes as Brinke enters and exits the home.<br /><br />The kill - a - spouse - for - the - inheritance plot has been done a million times before , the ending is an unintentional laugh riot ( concluding with a direct rip - off of the Zuni Fetish Doll segment in TRILOGY OF TERROR ) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head FX for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit . Brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic , but the biggest surprise of all is how good former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in her role . She stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here .
0 Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director , even as far as B movie directors go , but ' Haunting Fear ' is probably one of his better films . Yes , it does butcher the great Poe story ' Premature Burial ' and yes , it is badly paced and uneven throughout , but it is also pretty entertaining . Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty , fragile housewife whose worthless husband ( Jay Richardson ) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster ( played by Robert Quarry ) . Delia Sheppard , a veteran of many early 90s soft - core movies , actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress . You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic , Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes . The ending did n't make much sense !
0 I purchased this video quite cheaply ex - rental , thinking that the cover looked quite nice . And it was nice , but the movie is trash . I can handle B - grade , I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp ( ie . ' Surf Nazis Must Die ' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be ) , but this was just bland bland bland . Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences . This movie has very little to offer .
0 A woman 's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive . The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement . Of course B - horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature . The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard . And the last twenty minutes of Brinke 's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch . The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful . Better watch " Scalps " or " Alien Dead " again . Of course I ai n't expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray , but " Haunting Fear " is too dull to be enjoyable .
0 Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie . Now , imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity . Now imagine something 50 times worse.<br /><br />Got that?<br /><br />OK , now go see The Underground Comedy Movie . That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever . UCM is the single worst movie I 've ever seen . There were a few cheap laughs ... very few . But it was lame . Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame , it was too lame to be funny.<br /><br />The only reason I 'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it . He wasted his money . Vince Offer has n't written or directed anything else and it 's no surprise why .
0 I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago , and said to myself , " Seems funny , plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan , how can I lose ! " I proceeded to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for it . I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted . Wooden performances abound . All the " hilarious " and " outstanding " performances promised never seemed to arrive . After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame , knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back . I literally almost cried as well , because if that was what could be considered " comedy " I did n't want to believe in movies anymore . My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was . Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he did n't want to watch it alone . This was my next horrible mistake , because as I watched I just became angry . I began to yell at the movie , and I 'm not one to talk to movies period . Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they 've ever seen . My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends , but that could not save this movie even . The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding . The fact that its rating ( at the time of this writing ) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity .
0 This is the worst movie I 've ever seen in my life . This is saying quite a bit , considering some of the choices I 've made in film rentals.<br /><br />I got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it . The topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to Roseanne sing Big Spender.<br /><br />The " skits " are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker - room gags , and it 's such a blatant ( and poor ) rip - off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you 'll be begging for Big Jim Slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of " Vince Offer " ( whoever that is).<br /><br />Unless you are a masochist , avoid this pile of rubbish .
0 I 'm into bad movies but this has NOTHING going for it . Despite what the morons above have said , it is NOT funny . I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so boring that the Director / Writer should be prohibited from EVER directing anything but local cable access EVER again ! To love movies and comedy is to despise this film . I may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was . If you like this movie you ARE a pothead as sober there is NOTHING here . ZERO ! If you need to compare underground movies , see " Kentucky Fried Movie " or early John Waters . The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to show me the satire . The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it 's FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING but if it 's NOT funny you are not satirical , you are not edgy , you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny . ZERO !
0 And I repeat , please do not see this movie ! This is more than a review . This is a warning . This sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made . At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos : Everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right . Comedy is hard ! This is not some genre any fool can play around with . I think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to " Kentucky Fried Movie . " Basically , these bozos are comparing their so - called comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers . Come on , I 've seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than " The Underground Comedy Movie . " Here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie : One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named D**kman . The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . That 's it . That 's the whole joke . Wow . This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes . Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . And in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini - clad middle - aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . Plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . It 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . The whole movie is supposed to be a satire . I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire ... is TRUTH ! ! ! For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags ! Some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably wo n't be funny on screen . If I tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh . But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag . I hate how whenever people criticize a low - brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck - up squares . I just saw " White Chicks " recently . That 's another low - brow , politically incorrect comedy , but I laughed my head off . The most offensive thing about " The Underground Comedy Movie " is it 's not funny ! What the writers and directors do n't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does n't work . There has to be more ! Just think of the famous scene from " There 's Something About Mary " ( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list ) . The joke about the semen was n't just funny because it involved bodily fluids . There was a buildup . Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did n't go out on a date with a " loaded gun . " Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . A knock is on the door , and he has to answer it . His date , Mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off Ben 's ear . In this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever . As Jay Leno always says , " This comedy thing 's not so easy , is it ? " Keep that in mind , Vince Offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . Let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . I know comedy is subjective ... but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . As a side note , the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncan 's fame in movies like " Armageddon " and " The Green Mile . " There ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . All the others in the cast are either non - actors , has - been actors or B - movie stars . Karen Black made a good impression in " Five Easy Pieces , " but I do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since . Slash was probably drugged into being in this film . Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without " Baywatch . " Angelyne is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind Duncan was n't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her -- for good reason . Usually , I 'm in support of extremely low - budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . I hope to Lord this does n't become a cult classic ! Should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?
0 A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day . Not as mind - numbingly awful as say " Freddy Got Fingered " or " Lost Reality " , but that in NO way is an endorsement in ANY way , sense or form . Features the worst rhyming clown ever . Any most if it is n't offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct . It also has the worst song parody EVER put on film , the WORST Arnold impersonation EVER ( not just the worst put on film , literally the worst EVER ) . I have NO clue why Karen Black , Micheal Clarke Duncan , or Slash would star in this ( the reasons I watched this in the first place ) The only thing mildly amusing was Dickman . In conclusion I would't recommend this film to ANYONE , but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic . Do something notable with you lives people . Plus if it 's true the Church of Scientalogy hates him , he ca n't be ALL bad.<br /><br />My Grade : D
0 This movie does n't even deserve a one . This was an utter waste of time . It was a waste of film and money . It was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting . My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone . There is full frontal nudity and disgusting language . But not only that , there is NO plot line , the actors are terrible , the accents are horrible , the actors are small time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie ! < br /><br />The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt ( who got only a fifteen second part , by the way ) . I think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times , adding only a new sentence.<br /><br />A film similar to this is Eraser Head , possibly the most disturbing movie in existence . There is no plot line , and is not funny . Although it is n't trying to be funny . DO NOT WATCH EITHER MOVIE .
0 I rated this movie as AWFUL ( 1 ) . After watching the trailer , I thought this movie could be pretty cool . " Guaranteed to offend ... everyone ! " the trailer said . Well ... it did offend me , because this movie really sucks . It is hardly a comedy , as I laughed about two seconds during the entire movie . And what 's with all the gays in this movie ? I 'm not gay and I do n't have a problem with those who are , but what 's the point of adding so many gay - scenes in a so called comedy movie , when these scenes are absolutely not funny ? I guess the director is a gay man in denial , or something like that.<br /><br />So my advice to you is : if you want to waste good money , go rent a good comedy you 've already seen a million times , you 'll be better off than watching this Mother Of All Lousy Comedy 's . It really is total crap .
0 I bought this at tower records after seeing the info - mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central . I was actually really looking forward to watching this . My god where did i go wrong ? Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies , hell i own over 1,500 dvd 's ! With that said , the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have EVER seen . I tried to give it a chance , but not only was it not funny . It had no point , did not offend what - so - ever and was all around stupid . God who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny ? this is going right to the bottom of the bin ...
0 For shame , for shame that a fine actor such as Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel . The movie was not only bad , but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality . The plot , ( was there one ? ) seemed to go no where . The Russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances . I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and turned it off . A " 1 " for awful only because there is nothing lower . Do n't waste your time on this one , you 'll not miss anything .
0 Adrian has just gone out of the asylum , being rich and with no parents , his life seems empty . One day , he meets Gonzalo , a poor boy whom mother is prostitute . Desperate for earning some money , Gonzalo helps Adrian to search about his life and who where his parents . This is a movie from a new director , and it is perfectly clear in most of the film : scenes not correctly directed , dialogues a little forced , some incoherences in the script ... Anyway , the ending is unexpectedly well done ( well , just a little ) and that saves a little the film . Actors are known and with great quality , nevertheless , they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting ; all of them have done better papers in other film . The film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends . Of course there are lots of worse films , but , sure , there are many many better ones .
0 To start with , I have to point out the fact that you 're gon na feel completely lost for more than half an hour . Yeah , some things happen , but you do n't know why or what for . When you finally figure things out you just realize that it 's nothing but a twisted soad opera , dealing with mature prostitutes , dead mothers , illegitimate sons ... The characters are rather poor and the actors ( specially the young ones ) do n't help that much to make'em look credible . Only Marisa Paredes stands out , but she 's a superb actress , no matter if the movie is pure rubbish.<br /><br />The only positive things to say about " Frío Sol De Invierno " is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions , and he 's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense ... Well , maybe the next time ... <br /><br />*My rate : 4/10
0 This movie should be called " plan 9 from joseph smith . " i think its weirdness is underappreciated . the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich 's " the population bomb ( 1968 ) , " and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons . the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of " heavenly father 's " ( god 's ) plan . and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad . get it?<br /><br />This version was filmed in 1989 , which is confusing . it 's utah , so it looks and feels like 1983 , the play was actually written in 1973 , and of course , the theology is part 1840 's , part battlestar galactica . some of the action takes place on earth and some in the " pre - existence , an aimless romper - room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries , losing their shot at celestial glory.<br /><br />it is as stagey as they come , but do n't let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the ' cool kids ' are all into population control , ( presumably ) counseling their parents not to have any more children ! ! having big families was , at the time the play was written , the cultural norm in the lds community , and more importantly , considered part of God 's plan . the church has since done a 180 , and have made family planning a choice of the parents , and large families are much less the cultural norm now . making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern - day mormon moot!<br /><br />ahhh but it 's really only as good as the music . there are some catchy tunes here that just wo n't let this movie die the 1970 's death it was pre - destined for . the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there --wink . and the tough , cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica . so cheers to all that ! gather the family around , make some jell - o shooters and enjoy the show!<br /><br / >
0 I gave 1 to this film . I ca n't understand how Ettore Scola , one of the greater directors of Italian cinema , made a film like this , so stupid and ridiculous ! All the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial , boring and not interesting . Too long , too boring . The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann . Hope that Scola will change radically themes and style in his next film .
0 I 've said this in other reviews , without a story , you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want , still no one will give a damn.<br /><br />The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco ( which I love ) , and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making . However , it 's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie , he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned - plotted film . ( SPOILER ) For crying out loud , they forgot to have a villain in this thing ! OK they have one , but he 's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place . Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain . As far as action goes , well let 's see , Sky Captain ( Law ) shoots down ONE robot , two or three of the flapping wing airplanes ( before Dex ( Ribisi ) tells him to stop shooting them down ! ! ! ) , and a couple robots , but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him . Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie ( the reviewer who comments on hers and Law 's lack of chemistry is so right ) and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera , showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT , both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie , one uncomically , one quite funny , although I saw it coming from 70 years away . No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen , and that 's the movie 's real flaw . An audience does n't identify with robots , they need a hero to root for , and a visible , despicable villain to hate . Without that , plus a good engaging story , all the CG in the world wo n't help .
0 This movie feels so EMPTY . IN every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 . Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird.<br /><br />The ACTING was HORRIBLE ! It 's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor / actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives .. Looking at the floor for their marks ... <br /><br />Spoilers : Also you 'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie . At one point at Sky Captain 's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip . They have advanced warning an attack is coming ... So what do they do ? nothing . All of the planes get blown up and yet again the ONLY person fighting back is the Sky Captain ... <br /><br />THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he 's the ONLY person ever fighting back . At the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally ... but what do they do ? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
0 What a waste of time ! I 've tried to sit through ' Sky Captain .. " about 6 times , and every time , within about 3 minutes , I start doing something else - anything else ! It 's a downright boring movie , the acting is terrible , the writing dull , and obviously a first - time director , because it 's stiff . And I wanted to love it . I love sci - fi , the old cliffhangers , and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon , and Metropolis , but my God , what a waste of money . I used to work for Paramount Pictures , and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests . She told me they 'd never have an interest or need to do it . 10 years later , Paramount releases this piece of crap . Sherry was right in 1993 , but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog . Blue screen an effect shot , but not an entire movie . Let 's not forget , neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors ( but easy on the eyes ) . Paltrow 's performance reminds me of a high school effort . Too bad - it could 've worked , but only under a skilled director . the funny thing is , Sky Captain 's director will keep getting work , even after this dreck . It 's commerce , not art !
0 In a word , this film was boring . It lacked life and spark . A big problem is with the two leads . Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever . He was boring , and she was annoying . < br /><br />The visuals were interesting , but they did n't enhance the scenes . If anything , the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen . None of the action sequences felt real , and hence , the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger.<br /><br />The film had potential , but it needed a better script , better acting , and a better director . I kept thinking during the film , you know , this movie would 've worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain , Karen Allen was Polly , and Steven Spielberg was the director . < br /><br />Ignore the critical acclaims for this film . The critics I think are praising the film because they * want * to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels .
0 " Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow " ( an amazingly incovenient title ) is simply a bad movie ; it has no heart , no deep ideas , nothing very special about it . Yes , the CGI backgrounds look interesting , but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus . Additionally , the movie uses music the same way as , say , " Gilligan 's Island " or the Scooby - Doo cartoons-- IT NEVER STOPS . Terribly , simply terrible . There are no fresh ideas , either , just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc . , of bits taken from older movies and serials . There is no gatekeeper here , the movie just seems to exist because it can . Save your money and your time . Not entertaining at all .
0 Visually interesting , but falls flat in the originality department . This tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle . Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast , but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen on the big screen . In fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film , and had me thinking about work , bills , my dogs , etc . There are many moments that scream bluescreen . Paltrow is as wooden as they get . This could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp . My only complaint on the technique is that Black & White film ( sorry , computer ) would of helped because it looks like Turner colorized black and white . Just a big dull cliché mess . I would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again .
0 " Sky Captain " may be considered an homage to comic books , pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres . One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences . I do n't think this is at all true . One 's expectations of the films , fiction and serials that " Captain " pays tribute to were entirely different . Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children . This film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those . Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama . Toward the climax of " Captain " Law and Paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal . They take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy . Of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency.<br /><br />One does n't expect films like this to necessarily " make sense " . One does expect them to be fun , thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic . " Captain " has almost none . Remember when Law and Paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge ? Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side ? They can FLY ! ! ! The chasm itself means nothing to them . The bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape ? If the land across the chasm is ' forbidden ' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if.<br /><br />I know that Paltrow and Law ( both of whom have given fine performances in the past ) were playing " types " but both were pretty flat . Only Giovanni Ribisi ( who showed himself capable of great nuance here ) and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any " oomph " to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he 'd only been given the chance . He did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted.<br /><br />The film had a great ' look ' but there are so many ways in which CGI distracts . CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical , when it is used to create creatures who do n't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular . When it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints . There is no real sense of wonder . A CGI mountain does n't have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does . I know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it was n't necessarily supposed to LOOK real but should n't it FEEL that way ? It just did n't . < br /><br />As for the weak and clichéd script ... homage is no excuse . Even so , had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable . " The Last Samurai " was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that " Captain " did n't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that " Sky Captain " most definitely did not.<br /><br />I'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30 's and 40 's . The original ( Jay Garrick ) Flash or Green Lantern ( Alan Scott ) come to mind as being ripe for such treatment . Maybe the better , more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film . It would be hard to be worse .
0 Sky Captain is possibly the best awful movie I 've seen in a long while . Rife with amazing CG and special effects , studded with an A - list cast ( Jude Law , Gwyneth Paltrow , Angelina Jolie and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi ) and racing along with an overused but Indiana Jones - esquire storyline , this should have been a great movie to watch.<br /><br />'Should have ' being the key term here , of course.<br /><br />Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over - the - shoulder , heart - melting smirks , but you ca n't make something out of nothing , and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks ca n't save the movie 's stone dialogue . ( If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said , " Good boy , Dex , " just ONE more time , I might have barfed all over the guy in front of me . ) Gwyneth Paltrow , as Polly Perkins , is nothing less than nerve grating . Her nasal whining and not - quite - sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie . Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30 's comic book heroine- who knows ? I expected more from her . An example of how a similar character was played ( and played well ) is in the late 90 's flick " The Phantom , " starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane . Rent the movie and you 'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving graces in the film . ( Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch . I 'll admit it . ) In just a few short scenes , both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry , two - dimensional castmates.<br /><br />The plot and steady story progression were old , boring , and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years . The pace is rapid - fire in the first half of the movie , and a snail 's pace in the second , giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film , but to figure out who the key villain is as well . The pairing is rather clichéd , also- Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly - ended romance , and their story is n't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched . When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film , nobody 's surprised , and nobody really cares either.<br /><br />Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film , and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout . But Sky Captain , despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie , falls flat on its face . Not even worth the $ 2.75 I paid to get into the theater .
0 I like the time period , I like the attempt , but watching a movie that looks like I 'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache . If I played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus , I would upgrade my computer . Could be that this was the look the director was after , but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes . If I had n't taken someone with me to this film , I was out of there . Even though it was a series and not a movie per say , Band of Brothers accomplished this . They made it look like WWII footage , with just a touch of graininess , but it was still a pleasure to watch . Movies need real people , with real sets , and real locations ; Use CGI when it is appropriate , not for an entire film .
0 Visually stunning ? Most definitely . I have seen few films look this good in some time . Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography , computer graphics , and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh . The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s . The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason . Also , mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide . Who can stop them and save the world ? Alright , it does n't take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead , and in the wings his trusty , thoroughly competent sidekick . What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization . The plot for this film is ridiculous . That being said , the film is going for a serial - like feeling of film serials of yesteryear . They had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them , and I mean none of them , had the budget and big names this film had . Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat , one would think , but Sky Captain sinks miserably . Despite its fantastic dark look , I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life . I had little interest in a story that generated little interest . I did n't care at all for any of the glib portrayals . Paltrow was just awful . Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance . Law can not carry the one - liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders . I mean , let 's face it , he 's not Will Smith , Mel Gibson , or even Wesley Snipes . The sad thing about Sky Captain , at least for me , was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little . I was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came .
0 A gave it a " 2 " instead of a " 1 " ( awful ) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning , a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork . But that was n't enough to save it.<br /><br />The " sepia " toned , washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies . Nothing new there . I can see there were some hat - tips to other old , classic movies . OK . No problem with that.<br /><br />But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting , not something that would put you to sleep.<br /><br />The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful , the characters two dimensional . Slow moving . Some of the scenes were pretty to look at , but ultimately , as a whole , it was quite boring , I could n't recommend it .
0 This movie was way over - hyped . A lot of the viewers , who thought this was " amazing " must have been into the old school movies , cause the whole movie is set in the past . At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past , so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass , but it just going . Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past , and the 2 do n't mix very well in this movie , even with special effects . You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with . There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did , so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying " it 's the greatest movie ever done " . It 's just crap on a stick . It also did n't help that the story line was sooo crappy . I do n't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced , and I also do n't understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this . It 's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "It will all be done on a computer " . This was a movie that should have been on a movie network , because nothing about this movie was revolutionary . I 'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this . Whatever you do , do n't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow .
0 The exploding zeppelins crashing down upon ' Sky Captain ' Jude Law 's base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is . First off , let me state right off the bat that I sincerely doubt that Paramount will ever recover any money from this film . A cult hit it might become , but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve . I can see the studio pitch now . " Let 's combine 1920 's German Expressionism and a 1940 's globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene ! Wow , wo n't that be a success ! " Skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess . There are too many fake explosions , too many unconvincing dogfight scenes , and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two - dimensional . After all , why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three , or five , or one hundred ? ! Moreover , what could have been a groundbreaking film , seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting , will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using CGI . Quite simply , the graphics are amazingly poor . From the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights , everything seems to be just a little off . I 'm not being nit - picky here in any way . An infant could notice that a car does n't glide along the road like a maglev train ( unless its a Mercedes S500 ) . And for those of you raising your voices in protest , crying out ' This is a stylized film , it 's not supposed to be like reality ' , let me just say this . Lord of the Rings has set the standard for integrating real - life actors with CGI , Starship Troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films , the Rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920 's back into the Hollywood film portfolio , and Tim Burton 's Batman created a unique picture of New York City / Gotham that has yet to be repeated . Sky Captain falls so short of all these films , it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence . Plus , the acting is so poor , it makes me positively ill . So there you have it . I spent $ 9 to see this film and you get my review . I hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that I did .
0 I entered the theater to Sky Captain in 2004 expecting a good film . Nearly every review of this movie had been positive , the effects looked enticing , the previews convincing.<br /><br />Needless to say , disappointment actually does n't describe the feeling I got from this film . It was rage.<br /><br />Beyond being boring and poorly written , the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source . I understand the difference between an homage and stealing : this was stealing . More importantly , it seems that the filmmakers did n't steal to progress a point or move the plot along . They stole just to show that they could . There is literally no point to showing a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene ( that I wo n't elaborate on ) which steals from the same film . Needless to say , every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept : it was literally just a rehash of something I had already seen , from pulp - era robots reminiscent of the old Superman Cartoons and the recent film " The Iron Giant " , to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films , most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in " Star Wars : The Phantom Menace".<br /><br />On the subject of the actual film , most of the performances were completely wooden . Perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue - screen , with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors . Frankly , this is no excuse for poor acting . If a person was ever a child , they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying.<br /><br />Finally , there is no humanity in this film . The protagonists are the only real human beings here . Nearly all the antagonists are robots , and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand . If robots are attacking the entire planet , should n't we expect to see masses of humanity running from them ? The sub - par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to , really , anything here.<br /><br />The film was n't the worst movie out there , which is why I did n't give it a 1 . Rather , the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films : the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects , but without artistic vision or originality of any kind , it falls flat .
0 When robot hordes start attacking major cities , who will stop the madman behind the attacks ? Sky Captain ! ! ! Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan , the ace of the skyways , tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex - girlfriend Polly Perkins ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) and former flight partner , Captain Franky Cook ( Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming . The film 's running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie . The visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that . However , there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals . The film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary . I blame director and writer Kerry Conran . He focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story . The movie is like a girl with no personality , after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring . Sky Captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality . It 's simply just another case of style over substance.<br /><br />The acting is surprisingly average and that 's not really their fault since they had very little to work with . The main reason I watched this movie is because of Angelina Jolie . However , the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes . Her performance is surprisingly bland as well . Jude Law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him . Gwyneth Paltrow was just average , nothing special at all . Ling Bai 's performance was the only one I really liked . She gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film.<br /><br />The movie is not a complete bust though . There were some " wow " and exciting scenes . There just were n't enough of them . The film just does n't have that hook to really make it memorable . It was actually quite bland and it was n't very engaging at all . It 's too bad the film was n't very good since it had such a promising premise . In the end , Sky Captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching . Rating 4/10
0 In short , this movie is completely worthless.<br /><br />The idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future . An interesting idea , but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief , so the idea just flops.<br /><br />Apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed . But as a graphics person , the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening . The color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality . And I do n't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking . If anything , the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics -- they do n't measure up even to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics . The models for the robots were so simple , plain and very uncompelling . There were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric - like animals on that island , but they are not explained in any way.<br /><br />The story is horrible beyond belief . In fact I ca n't believe I did n't just walk out of this movie . The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated , and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception . Why is the Morris Paley character even there ? We are not in any way convinced that Joe is heroic -- I mean he flies a plane , and saved one person ( Polly ) for personal reasons . Yeah there 's a great hero for you . Dex has very little screen time , so why are we supposed to care about Joe wanting to save him ? Who were the Nepalease that locked Joe and Polly in the mine vault , and why would they do it ( remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was robotic)?<br /><br />Plot holes : ( 1 ) Why did Bai Ling 's character ( a major fall from her excellent character in " The Crow " ) halt the robots who had captured Joe ? They were looking for the vials , and had not found them . ( 2 ) Why in the hell would Dex be captured but not killed ( he does n't have or know about the vials , and the bad guys did n't know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex ) ? ( 3 ) Polly indicates that " they " do n't know anything about Totenkopf , yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI - style file on him . ( 4 ) The blank spot on the map as described by the Nepalese -- if they know all about this mysterious area , then why the hell is their map blank in that spot ? ( 5 ) At one point , Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes ( they are burned ) -- Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes , yet Polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress , then in the same line of continuity suddenly Polly has her original clothes back.<br /><br />*sigh*. How far off am I supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap?<br /><br />We are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music , even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen.<br /><br />And the acting ? We 're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents ? Which character is n't annoying ? I think Ling Bai 's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie ( she does n't have a single line ) . The dialogue was n't camp , and does n't even rise to the level of cheese . Its just bad and annoying . These people are n't hero 's or compelling ; they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life.<br /><br />I ca n't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on IMDb . IMHO it should be competing with " Batman Forever " in the bottom 100 of all time .
0 I saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and I walked out . It was pretty horrible . In the process of trying too hard , they over acted and made a horrible movie . I was disappointed since I felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one could n't be that far off the mark -- but , I was wrong . I was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to release this movie . I was lured in by the free aspect of the preview , but it turned out to be a waste of my time -- and , usually , I 'm very easily amused . It tried to be innovative and creative with the shots , ideas and filming , but because they threw together so many ideas at once , it failed . I 'm not usually picky about movies and I usually do n't feel the need to display my opinions about movies , but I had to warn everyone not to watch it . I registered on IMDb just to tell all of you guys
0 If you are looking for eye candy , you may enjoy Sky Captain . Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live performers . The visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie . Now , saying that , the visuals are the ONLY thing good in Sky Captain.<br /><br />After ten minutes , I knew I was watching one of the worse movies of all time . I was hoping this movie would get better , but it never achieved any degree of interest . After thirty minutes , the urge to walk out kept growing and growing . Now , I own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number . Yet , this is only the second movie I felt like walking out of my entire life.<br /><br />Acting --- there is none . The three main performers are pitiful . Jude Law ( also in the other movie I wanted to walk out on ) is just awful in the title role . I would rather sit through Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Law again.<br /><br />Paltrow tries SO hard to be campy , that it backfires in her face . The last article I had read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting . After this performance , I would applaud that decision.<br /><br />Story --- Soap operas are better written . The story behind Sky Captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses.<br /><br />Directing --- none . Everything was put into the special effects that story , acting and directing suffer greatly . Even " the Phantom Menace " had better acting and that is NOT saying a great deal.<br /><br />I would have to give this movie a " 0 " out of " 10 " . Avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release .
0 Unashamedly ambitious sci - fi from Kerry Conran , for whom this is clearly a labour of love . Unfortunately it 's just not that good . It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score , a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg . The movie also references many pulp sci - fi novels , serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still , Superman , Metropolis , Planet Of The Apes , The Iron Giant , Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me . The film however , fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons : the main being that it 's such a labour of love , so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world , Conran actually forgets about making a movie . There is little to no tension , atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles , dinosaurs and race - against - time set - pieces . Even the noir elements fall flat . This is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green - screen just looks like a video game half the time and it 's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards . The actors do n't get to do much either - Jude Law is wooden , Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid , Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it 's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything . It is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday . Nice ending though .
0 Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain ! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties . This is a horrible film in every way . Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher / comedy video . They would receive a D for this . College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school . Since this monstrosity was made by " Professionals " I believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation . I enjoy watching bad movies Like " Plan 9 From Outer Space " but , this thing does n't even fall into that category . The script , acting , sound , and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable . If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood , blaxploitation , or 1970 's horror films . After viewing this you get the feeling you 've wasted an hour and a half of your life .
0 By reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing . You know the type .... funny but supposed to frighten you .... this was not funny or horrific . the writing was lame ... the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness .... they were so expected . the actors did n't even do much with such a not so good script ... at least I hope that was n't their best .. watch this movie at your own risk ...... I give it negative 3 stars outta 10
0 I went to see this film with low expectations , but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film . Sadly , that 's about all I got . The story covers familiar territory ( the high school reunion ) , but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well - worn theme . Though the quality of the acting was good overall , the content of the film was appalling . The sexism of the film was blatant -- women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married , procreating or both ( though this was couched as a post - feminist choice ) . Worse still was the racism -- the shrill Jewish mother , the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty ( tormenting the class geek ) . We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo , and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen .
0 As a former Kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town I was looking forward to seeing this movie . But , what a disappointment ! Although the acting and the production values are n't bad , the script is awful , the plot is unrealistic , and the theme is disturbing.<br /><br />The main message of this film is that Women are nothing without husbands and children . I can hardly believe how regressive it is in it 's view of women . Has the writer been living under a rock ? < br /><br />Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen , I would n't suggest this movie to anyone . It 's terrible . It 's an embarrassment to the city it 's named after .
0 One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams , rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins . One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold - bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s . This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside , causing the material to wash downhill , where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment . The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries . The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas . Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields , where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult . Thus , the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.<br /><br />First , we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor , a very rare treatment in 1938 . A story about wheat farmers and gold miners would n't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time . The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors , with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations . Then , we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero , to be paired with Olivia de Havilland . Among other things , this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it . Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes , in his small role , seemed unusually subdued . Unfortunately , I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film . The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems . It needed to be more like " The Good Earth " , released just the year before . Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man , such as Errol Flynn . Finally , there is the matter of the inane title . Surely , Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title . " Gold or Grain " is short and to the point . Incidentally , I understand there is still plenty of gold in ' them thar hills ' , waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining .
0 This movie is a bad to alright rip off of Friday the 13th . The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp . He kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father , and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother ( Another F13th take off ) . The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims . Then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods , soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son . Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute . He sets Bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on.<br /><br />This Movie is only recommended to those who enjoy B grade 80 's Slashers .
0 As far as I can tell you , in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors , this film IS currently available on DVD . I found it only a few weeks ago.<br /><br />It is on the Value DVD label and I paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it . I found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks . Now do n't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super - duper Swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had ? ? ? I thought so.<br /><br />This film was indeed well worth 98 cents . 99 cents , I might start to argue with you . But clearly worth 98 cents . And remember that saying about getting what you pay for . For slasher film mavens only .
0 IT IS So Sad . Even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like Blood Lake , There 's Nothing Out There & . The music they play in this is the funniest stuff i 've ever heard . i like the brother and sister in this movie . They both do n't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they 're saying stuff like " My friends are going to be so jealous ! " Hey , what s with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning ? That s retarded ! I practically ignored the second half of this . My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe . The same exact sound for every chop !
0 I love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one . But this film is static . Never mind the production value , which is very noble for its budget , but the pacing is deadly . Admittedly these folks achieve much with little , but the film fails on the most fundamental level . It 's boring . The editing is glacial and the pacing stalls . It should have been 65 minutes . The best thing about the Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who is n't seen nearly enough . He had the most dramatic potential . Instead we have to suffer through dithering Baltimorean - Brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition . It feels like a backwater stage play committed to video.<br /><br />Noble efforts by everyone in the production , but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice . Instead it 's just a lame retread .
0 In sixth grade , every teacher I had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester . Every class had something to do with this terrible show . We watched it in English and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters . In math we talked about charts and other sea crap . In science we talked about whales ( which was actually somewhat interesting , so this was n't a 100 % waste of time ) . All day everyday was torture . Not only that , but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well . I could see if this was a new series or something , but it was , like , ' 93 . I 'm still trying to block this out .
0 They made me watch this in school and it was terrible . The movie is outdated . The episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting . The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience . I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors , but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life . This accounts for cheesy acting very often . Also , very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far - fetched . I do n't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them . Though , it was written to be educational , funny , suspenseful , and hip , It ended up being boring , dry , far - fetched , and old . I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it .
0 The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script . It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie 's story and re - creations of the Klaw short films . While the Klaw re - creations are well done , it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety . Page Richards , while not an amazing actress , does a decent job overall . And , at times , she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie . Also of note is some faithful attention to detail . Costumes and clothing well done , as is some of the set direction . The sets are generally sparse and feel stage - y , but do feel of the era . It is sometimes surprisingly well lit , and the color palette was clearly thought - out to give the overall look a vibrant , retro feel .
0 This movie was bad beyond belief . I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival . Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before , which happened to be its " world premiere . " I do n't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point . We all understood by the end . < br /><br />Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one . Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige , in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies . The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least . A scene would start going then someone would say " wow you 're so great Bettie , why do n't we make another movie . " this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as ( and even more boring than ) the normal part of the movie . by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up . it was that ludicrous . I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre , but people were not laughing with the movie maker , they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure . This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory . < br /><br />I know movies are expensive . I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen . The movie looks like it was made for $ 12 . The cuts , the graininess , and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience . This movie makes " Dude , Where 's My Car ? " look like Citizen Kane . < br /><br />My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured . The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good . Apparently , the previous night , the night of the " world premiere " the director / writer / producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie . Bettie Paige 's movies were destroyed . They should destroy this movie too .
0 I 'm kinda torn on DARK ANGEL . The film appears to be a " loving " tribute to the greatest pin - up to ever live - but there is so little actual " content " that the film itself is virtually pointless . I ca n't really see what the motivation or " point " of this film is - as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative - so those who do n't know much about Bettie are n't gon na know much more after watching DARK ANGEL either ... <br /><br />The film basically chronicles the last few years of Bettie 's career in bondage modeling . Almost the entire film is comprised of " re - enactments " of some of Bettie 's more " famous " photo - shoots and loops . These re - enactments take up literally 75 % of the films run - time , and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person . The film touches briefly on her short - lived legitimate acting pursuits , and her subsequent decision to leave the " business " and become religious - but all of this is pretty much glossed - over in favor of showing long and drawn - out re - enactment scenes ... <br /><br />DARK ANGEL is n't a horrible film - there 's just no substance to it . The other problem is that the actress that plays Bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots - up - close it 's a no - go . The other thing that irritated me , is that although Bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits . The film itself is obviously extremely low - budget , but does what it can set and costume - wise within it 's limitations - so no gripes from me there . The acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved . In fact - the most memorable thing about the whole film for me , was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played Irving Klaw 's real name is Dukey Flyswatter . No joke - check the cast list . Ca n't say that I recommend this one too highly unless you are a true Bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her . And if you are that bad off - then you need to seek treatment anyway ... 4/10
0 This documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of Betty Page's(Paige Richards ) career . The Tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin - up queen in history . Her most memorable work came in the 1950 's and was fetish photos , bondage and cat - fight " girly flicks " . Irving Klaw(Dukey Flyswatter)at his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera . There was no nudity in the famous photos or " stag films " , but nonetheless , Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution . It is no surprise that Betty had a cult following at the height of her career . The girl - next - door with jet black hair , blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades . After all , it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world , Elvis Presley . Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion . This movie actually could have been a lot better ; but good enough to hold interest.<br /><br />Miss Richards is stunning in her own right . Bra , panties , garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least . Also in the cast : Jaimie Henkin , Jana Strain , Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone . Be advised this movie can change your heart rate .
0 ... and even then , even they can live without seeing it . To be honest , this film ( if one deigns to call it that ) is of real interest only to bondage freaks . Bettie Page fans will learn absolutely nothing new ( and I do mean * nothing * ) , nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar , loved , or cherished.<br /><br />Nevermind the abysmal screenplay , the wooden , less - than - community - theater acting , the utter absence of direction , the crappy lighting , or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values . This is definitely " Hey , kids , let 's make a movie ! " movie - making of the lowest order . I suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera . No , I 'm sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright * wrong*.<br /><br />It 's wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page , a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs , utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged . This is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess , but not for the wretched excess itself , which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re - enacted B&D set - pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux - biographical scenes delineating Ms. Page 's fall from grace ( so to speak ) . There 's actually probably more information , per se , about Page 's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Do not be fooled . This is not a worthy companion film to " The Notorious Bettie Page . " This is not a worthy film at all . This is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin - ups of all time , and does it without class , without style , and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page whatsoever . No true Bettie Page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment , I guarantee that.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs . If free , remember that time is money , too . Yours may not be worth much , but I 'm betting it 's worth enough that you 'll be sorry you wasted time with this one . That 's it , I 'm done , you 've been warned .
0 I watched the movie , and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience . The language would put to shame the street loafers.<br /><br />The plot ; a father forcing none of his son to marry , seems far - fetched . < br /><br />The idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded 's attention.<br /><br /> ... and I was waiting the whole movie for a laugh , and laugh I did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look.<br /><br />Hope it saves YOUR time !
0 Cybil Richards directs another Full Moon / Surrender Cinema masterpiece of erotica . This time Jacqualine Lovell ( dressed in rather fetching silver outfit ) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity . However she ca n't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them . The sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack ( at least for this sort of film ) . The cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too . Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below . She also fits in a little lesbian activity . To be honest Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare . Here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the ' drama ' . Utterly rubbish movie with Lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features . Mediocre even for Surrender 's output and clearly a new budget low for them also .
0 Lolita is a rebel and she 's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories , between sci - fi and fantasy ... Well , this Surrender Cinema production is not very good : very bad acting , horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line . BUT , the sex scenes are pretty well done , lot of lesbian scenes , and Jacqueline Lovell , as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax , offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show . For Lovell 's fans only .
0 For a film with so much promise it was disappointing , thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable . The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it 's the worst clichéd ending I 've seen in a movie for some time . The final scene would have ripped my heart out , if the entire movie had n't been so painful to begin with . I was numb ! From the very first scene - one was left wondering , if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help , or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting I 've seen to date . It was a horror in the true sense of the word .
0 This was a movie about infidelity and revenge . A twin with the " twin " connection senses that something is wrong with her sister . This movie took forever to establish the plot . A plot that has been done many times . The acting was lousy for the most part . Once the plot comes together , the movie ends . Laura and Ashley are twins that live with an abusive father . The father seems to favor Ashley , so Laura gets the blame for everything . There is a promise made that the girls would never be apart , but as they grow up , their lives go in different directions . Ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets Barry , a married man . Of course no good can come of this . The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down . I kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere , but it never happened .
0 This movie is n't worth the film it was photographed on . The dialog is flat , filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time . The choppy , shaky , film style is a cheap imitation of the " The Ring " style visual effects . The characters do not even act like a normal person would . For example , the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door , creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she does n't even once call out her sister 's name to see if she is home . What ? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her . Way too many flashbacks to her childhood . Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director . It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street , up the driveway , around this corner , over here , over there , oh a side view , now a front view . Enough already . You would think you are watching a TV commercial for the Solaris ! Terrible movie . 0 out of 100 . I really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it .
0 So the wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off . For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie , there was just very little excitement . The acting was atrocious , to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes ( the church lady for example ) . The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin , although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like The Ring . Rather then get the police involved -- which I 'm sure those earplugs she found would have DNA all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to ' get ' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister . I call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too , which the movie then fades to black . Bad dialog , bad acting , bad ending .
0 Just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home . She then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why.<br /><br />This is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but does n't quite . I ca n't really put my finger on why it did n't work but it was good enough that I kind of wished it was better , or at least had gotten the little things right- like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size . I think perhaps that s what s wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong .
0 Okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $ 60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed ? Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why would n't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her ? And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her " proof " . I do n't know I was not happy with the ending . This movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad ! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy .
0 I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago . First , I 'm going to say that it looks great . Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer . I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks . I would not call this a horror movie . Putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie . There 's no mystery , there 's no suspense , you know who did it the entire time . < br /><br />It 's a drama . You know what 's going on with both sides the entire movie . The acting was okay , I guess , but nothing special.<br /><br />And the tagline , " Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... they should have check how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have that exact same tagline?<br /><br />It pains me to say some of this , but I know a lot of the people who worked on this movie , and I know they do n't want people blowing smoke up their ass , so I give my honest opinion .
0 OK ... I watch a lot of bad movies . I pride myself on that fact . many times there are some gems in the B rated bombs . But this movie is one of the worst I have watched . I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot of and sense of movement . The opening scenes seemed pretty good . Decent music and imagery . Then it goes down hill from there . One of the main characters has a disability ( Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus ) . Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret . They made that too much of a focus of the movie . So what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he should n't have been . No need to keep bringing it up . So this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table . So instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body . Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her . Well after seeing her sister over and over again ( as a zombie like ghost ) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her . Now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her . Bad thing is that she did n't have much of a plan . Only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped . The idiot did n't even believe he killed her . So all is revealed there and even though she had a gun .... somehow she manages to get herself strangled . So the last scenes of the movie are of the " spirits " of her and her twin walking out of the water . So you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins . And not one but two innocent people die.<br /><br />Good things about the movie : imagery < br /><br />Bad things about the movie : music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
0 The premise of this movie was decent enough , but with sub par acting , it was just bland and dull.<br /><br />SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death , it was accidental , so although it was a murder it was n't like the guy set out to do it . Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree . There is no emotion in this film . The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister , and hearing her message . It was dull and boring.<br /><br />With some polishing , and better acting it could have been pretty good .
0 There is so much that is wrong with this film , but to sum it up : Terrible acting- so bad it must have been on purpose . poor script - they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story . ridiculously bad ending- in some cases the ending manages to save the film - not in this case . if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for . This is the worst film i have seen in a long time . It was complete torture sitting through this film , i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance . So do yourself a favor . Watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do . Even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture .
0 I read John Everingham 's story years ago in Reader 's Digest , and I remember thinking what a great movie it would make . And it probably would have been had Michael Landon never got his hands on it . As far as I 'm concerned , Landon was one of the worst actors on earth , and his artistic license went way over the top , similar to his massacre of the " Little House " book series is proof . The acting , for lack of a better word , is atrocious , the screenplay sloppy , and there are more close - ups of Landon 's puss than should be allowed.<br /><br />This movie reflects Everingham 's story as much as " Little House On The Prairie " reflects the books is was " based " on . It 's just another vehicle to show off Landons horrendous hair .
0 This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy - McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes . It 's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers . In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow ; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.<br /><br />Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices ( with little acting ability ) and there 's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.<br /><br />This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers . With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation .
0 Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend ( Dick Foran ) thanks to his affection for his friend 's wife ( Angela Lansbury ) . This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason , so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting.<br /><br />There is n't all that much else here that 's interesting though . Lansbury is always good , but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious . There 's an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who 's also in love with the " femme fatale " , but the Burr character is pretty straightforward . It 's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury , and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films I 've seen him in . There 's no mystery at all really , and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that Burr 's character is setting up the Lansbury character to implicate herself ( double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder , presumably ) . He does so with a very large tape recorder which she does n't notice when she comes into the room I guess.<br /><br />A few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for TV .
0 As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser , I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released . Sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again , but it was no better the second time . Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer , but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester . The penchant for slapstick spoilt ' The Three Musketeers ' for me and the same applies here . To me , the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong . The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts , but they are adventure novels . There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all , he is involved in dangerous situations . This is conveyed in the novels , but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style . It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book . When I first read that the book was to be filmed , the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed . I rejoiced , as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman . How I would have loved to see him in the role . Malcolm McDowell is a good actor , but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books ( too scrawny looking ! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow ) . Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck . What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy . The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet ( Tom Bell ) . A great shame , as the production values , costumes , sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell . Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is , as a recent radio adaptation of ' Flash For Freedom ' , adapted by Mr Fraser , worked quite well . Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen .
0 No one is a greater fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser 's Flashman papers than I am.<br /><br />I was surprised to see just now that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash , since I also see he had made the Three / Four Musketeers with Fraser which I though turned out rather well.<br /><br />Not so Royal Flash.<br /><br />I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published up to that time , and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel ( I still am , but he was never really given a chance after that).<br /><br />What a disappointment ( I saw it once again when I was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse).<br /><br />None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen . The comedy of Flashman 's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do . The dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.<br /><br />Looking back with more mature eyes , the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda.<br /><br />If you have read the book and not seen the film , I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi has just invented : Russian roulette.<br /><br />A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.<br /><br />My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently , but I am glad I have not.<br /><br />If by any chance Fraser ever reads this , I can only say I think he is a genius -- perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation , but , based on my appreciation of that corpus of work , it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film , as that he did all those awful Roger Moore James Bond films .
0 Yeah , well , I definitely had regrets about giving up my Saturday night watching this strange little , yet very long , movie . Apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life . Here 's the epitome of the antihero in ' No Regrets . ' We have this jerk , so messed up , so wandering , so selfish , aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman 's up - and - coming son , Jaemin , unless it was just that : physical attraction . He claims otherwise , that it 's love . But after watching this , it 's like loving Charles Manson because you dig the beard . ( Alright , he 's not that bad , but still no real redeemable characteristics . ) I could never get past the reason Jaemin endless stalks Sumin . It was never shown , just told , that Jaemin loves Sumin . Perhaps it 's a culture thing that flew over my head : crazy / stalking = mad love over in Seoul . It has to be , because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point I thought this was turning into a screwball comedy . I was waiting for a tiger named " baby " to make an appearance . Okay , so Sumin works two jobs while going to school , so far so good on someone trying to better themselves . But after his first taste of his stalker 's attraction , he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring . What ? OK , well , as previously mentioned , the obsession does n't stop due to the job / career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup . Basic movie , not 100 % terrible , but you can do better with foreign gay - themed movies .
0 : : POTENTIAL SPOILERS::<br /><br />Man , this movie was awful . A Catholic / superstitious / suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies.<br /><br />The doubting priest . Sex and the priesthood . Politics and religion . Church hypocrisy . Conspiracy involving the church . The dawn of a new evil age . All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil.<br /><br />Pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice . The story revolves around two concepts : Absolution , better known as the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick - the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one 's sins while on the brink of death ; And Excommunication , the act of cutting a person off from the Church . Basically , an Excommunicated person ca n't receive Absolution . Thus comes in the Sin Eater , and I 'll leave it at that . Throw in all the dopy things I already listed and you have " The Order".<br /><br />I found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the Virgin Mary rather insulting to Catholics . It also ends with Heath Ledger saying ( I paraphrase ) " I am the redeemer and damner of sins , I live on without love blah blah blah " /cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla " The Matrix".<br /><br />I gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process . If you want to see something better I suggest " The Prophecy " with Christopher Walken .
0 The screenwriter poorly attempted to re - create the " Exorcist ' . But put in some blah - blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged . There is no substance whatsoever in this entire film . It had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about . Extremely boring , I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so I had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever . Nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about.<br /><br />They use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me ( as it intended , I hate CGI ) just ruined the movie even more . Some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how " thought - provoking " and " slow - paced - without - action - because it 's an intelligent film " it was . What is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy Heath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion ? Seems like an uninspired concept . Oh and there 's some mumbo jumbo about the " sin - eater " ( movie was originally going to be titled " sin - eater " ) . Lame concept but the movie took the " sin - eater " thing too seriously , making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was . Yeah , I know there were really sin - eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy.<br /><br />Nothing in the movie was executed right and I forget why I even bothered to see this movie . If you want horror films that actually have depth , watch Rosemary 's Baby , The Tenant , Naked Blood , Society , Cannibal Holocaust , Pin , Exorcist , Omen , or any of the Romero " Dead Trilogy " films . Nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people , mainstream movie fans think that though ( same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece ) . If you want mind - numbingly boring horror , watch the Order . This movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride .
0 In the bygone days of the Catholic Church , a sin - eater was an individual that , through ritual , would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves . Often , these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve , thereby denying them entrance into Heaven . The sin - eaters were seen as blasphemous , circumventing the chruch 's monopoly on redemption . Sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo , let the concept wander where it may , and you have " The Order " , a movie that combines " Stigmata " 's religious anti - authoritarianism , " The X - Files " ' paranormal investigation , and " The Thorn Birds " ' sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works.<br /><br />Alex ( Heath Ledger ) is a rogue priest , one of the last members of the Order of the Carolingians , a semi - heretical order of knowledge - seeking , demon - fighting priests . When Alex 's mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances , Bishop Driscoll ( Peter Weller ) sends Alex to investigate . Tagging along are fellow Carolingian Thomas ( Mark Addy ) and Mara ( Shannyn Sossman ) , who was subject to one of Alex 's exorcisms a year prior . The three go to Rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre Catholic heresy , ominous prophecies , demonic intrusions , and a man claiming to be the last surviving Sin - Eater ( Benno Furmann).<br /><br />Written and directed by Brian Helgeland ( who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and half - hearted " A Knight 's Tale " ) , the film is an odd one , and difficult to classify . It wants to be several things at once -- supernatural thriller , religious intrigue , dramatic television pilot -- and only sometimes succeeds at any of them . This is n't helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance . Ledger , in particular , has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance . Sossman , however , displayed the same disconnected performance that she 's given in all of her films ( most notably in " The Rules Of Attraction").<br /><br />The plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs , leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings . Large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times , which can be confusing for many , but this is also one of the film 's saving graces . The structure of the film -- coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film -- forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything ( the exception to this is historical background on the Carolingians and the practice of sin - eating , both of which are explained in dry exposition ) . Even at the beginning of the film , character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained . Combine this with the on - location shooting and judicious use of special effects , and you have a very old - world supernatural thriller , with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70's / early 80's.<br /><br />A brief mention here , as well , for the subtle and organic score by David Torn , a combination of minimalist orchestration and Lisa Gerrard - style exotic vocals . A very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity.<br /><br />A confusing plot , a lack of purpose , and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie , but for some reason , " The Order " remains watchable . Many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities , and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it . Still , the film 's sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the DVD , which I 'm sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes . A recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch . 6 out of 10 .
0 Horrible waste of time - bad acting , plot , directing . This is the most boring movie EVER ! There are bad movies that are fun ( Freddy vs. Jason ) , and there are bad movies that are HORRIBLE . This one fits into the latter . Bottom Line - do n't waste your time .
0 The good fellas at Webster 's Dictionary define Logophobia as the fear of words ' . I may just be Logophobic . For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film , credits contain the words ` Produced , Written and Directed by : ' , and are followed by a single individual 's name . Think about it . There are carpenters , electricians and plumbers , but so few jack - of - all - trades . Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films . But there I was , all nestled in my theatre seat , popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball , were the words ` Produced , Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland ' . Whoa ! < br /><br />Being a film buff , I knew of Brian Helgeland . As a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company 's stock price in 1998 . There were as many theatrical unpleasantries ( Assassins , The Postman , Conspiracy Theory ) as there were critical and award winning successes ( L.A. Confidential , Mystic River ) . They seemed to alternate  one good , one bad , so knowing that his last film , BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood 's career , I took a breath and hoped for the best . In retrospect , I should not have exhaled . < br /><br />The Order stars Heath Ledger ( Helgeland 's A Knights Tale ) , as Alex Bernier , a priest in an order known as the Carolingians , who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the Arch Bishop deems curious ' . Meeting up with Father Thomas ( also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings ' Mark Addy ) , they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest 's untimely death.<br /><br />Complicating matters is a sub plot involving Mara Sinclair ( played by Shannyn Sossamon ) who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism . Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience , they travel to Rome together.<br /><br />Nary a good nights sleep goes by and Alex is confronted by William Eden ( Benno Fürmann ) who claims to be a centuries old Sin Eater . A Sin Eater , as we are told , are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not , thus allowing entrance into Heaven . William , as luck would have it , is tired of a life of healing and looks for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties . Alex is reluctant , but after the death of his new love Mara , Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save her and the transformation is complete . Alex then searches for answers to his many queries while Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator . < br /><br />The Order is not a terrible film , but it is terribly boring . There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters . Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex walking in on the dying Mara - is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple 's plight . Everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film.<br /><br />So , Mr. Helgeland , I plead with you not to try this again . Share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self - serving . Until then , there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade . Two stars.<br /><br / >
0 The turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide . There was no real suspense . Most of the characters were insipid . The chesty Irish priest was as lame as the love interest . Interest is misleading . The girl that they chose to provide the film 's sensuality might be better . The central conflict of the main character was uninvolving . This film is entirely devoid of positives . It is like a tedious exercise by someone who did n't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway .
0 I should n't even review this movie , since it 's not actually a horror movie -- and thus not worthy of Dr. Cheese 's attention . At least , it 's not horror in the usual sense . It 's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap . That 's why I turned it off after the first four hours . Imagine my surprise , then , when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed . Yep , that 's right ; in plain terms , this movie is b - o - r - i - n - g.<br /><br />"The Order " had lots of flaws , not all of them unique . In particular , it seems to me the main problem with the " religious " subgenre of horror films is Hollywood 's unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms . It is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox . Just ask William Peter Blatty . In fact , without orthodoxy , films like this are just an anything - goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers ' ( usually dull and illogical ) imaginations.<br /><br />Think about it . If someone made a movie ostensibly about , say , physics , but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong , but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals , you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot . The same goes for these sorts of movies.<br /><br />In other words , " The Order"(and many similar movies before it ) invent out of whole cloth stuff about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions . Unsurprisingly , the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid . This movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing.<br /><br />Avoid this steaming pile .
0 What was the worst movie of 2003 ? " Cat in the Hat ? " " Gigli ? " Mais non ! I propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year . Badly written , badly edited , and ( if I may be so bold ) badly acted , " The Order " is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck . It is n't even accidentally funny , like ( for example ) " Showgirls." < br /><br />You know that the producers are assuming that their audience is n't going to be very smart . They renamed the movie , originally titled " The Sin Eaters , " because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was , even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie . Instead , they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there.<br /><br />And , hey , what do you know , they were right ! My ex - girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me in . Congratulations , producers , you 've met your target market . She also liked " Grease II , " so you 're in good company.<br /><br />Back on topic , Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific ( you guessed it ) order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor . He has celibacy issues , possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion , much less be a celibate monk . The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy . As much as I 've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen , his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of Monty Python , thinking that if they just said the lines like the Pythons did they would automatically be funny . You know the sort of people I 'm talking about.<br /><br />If I utter any more , I would be in danger of generating spoilers . Frankly , the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created .
0 My friends and I walked out after 15 minutes , and we were n't the first . Afterwards , we tried to get our money back . Movie theater management would n't allow this , but they did agree to let us see another film . The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star . As you can tell , this was n't a memorable night . Probably one of my worst movie nights . Close second has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist . In conclusion , for the sake of humanity , please do n't see The Order .
0 This sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what I heard about " Gigli " , that Ben and Jen flop earlier this Summer . " The Order " was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes , rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film , appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot . Now , I 'm a Heath Ledger fan ( " 10 Things I hate About You " , " A Knight 's Tale " and particularly his supporting role in " Monster 's Ball " ) , but my man needs to find himself a better agent . Keep accepting scripts like " The Order " and " Four Feathers " and he 's going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion.<br /><br />Here are the problems I had with the film . Firstly , the Director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with , well , much of anything . Plot skeins involving the American trying to take over the Vatican and the Dark Pope , while mildly interesting , did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters . The attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best . Secondly , please do n't insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory . We had manufactured angst , manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of " Matrix Reloaded " with skull - numbing techno music . Rather than developing character , these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were , a half - hearted attempt at putting popcorn - chewing adolescents in the seats . Thirdly , and most importantly , this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept . We have scandal , we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play . Why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone 's background ? We learn a little about Alex , but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days , a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past . And Alex is the most developed , if you can call it that , character in the entire film.<br /><br />As the cliche goes nowadays , if you 're going to see one movie this year , make sure it 's not this one . There 's about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair . The only thing that saved me was going with a girl who I 'm rather fond of.<br /><br />1 out of 10 . I 'm disappointed . File this one firmly under -had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing- . Heath my man , go back to Monster 's Ball - like cameos . They really suit you .
0 The coming attractions to " The Order " make it seem like a decent horror mystery / thriller , but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage.<br /><br />First off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects . The acting was also nothing to be proud of , but Keath Ledger ( I think I spelled that right . ) saved the movie in this category.<br /><br />For heaven 's sake : DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE !
0 OK , I did n't have high expectations but this film descending into depths I could not imagine.<br /><br />The plot , as it were , involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a Sin Eater . The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui . Nevermind that this makes no sense since then a Baptist could give you salvation .... we'll move on.<br /><br />I'll layout the plot w/o giving much away : the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to investogate . He brings with him a mental patient ( I 'm not making this up ) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him ( not one lick of this BTW is explained ) , a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal . They get to Rome , find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film , meet with a bondage gear S&M anti - pope that the drunk Irish guy knows ( not explained ) and who gives information by killing people ( oh , BTW , he 's a bad guy so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack ) and then ... umm , seriously , I 'm not sure . the plot meanders about . Heath chills with the Sin Eater , flies to New York with the Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then ( all off camera ) the anti - pope falls and the film ends.<br /><br />About 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened . By the end something has happened but you ca n't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off - scren you 're really feeling cheated .
0 I was not entirely impressed by this film . It was originally named Sin Eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film . I 'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it . It was very slow and what was with picking Robocop ( Peter Weller ) as one of the main actors . That was a sad point.<br /><br />All in all I would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the Catholic religion but do n't expect an Exorcist or Stigmata from this film . It will surely flop after a few days and word gets out .
0 The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named Brother Dominic ( Francesco Carnelutti ) is found dead , cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier ( Heath Ledger ) is contacted by top - brass Cardinal Driscoll ( Peter Weller ) who ask 's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic 's death . Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims ( Shannyn Sossamon ) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett ( Mark Addy ) Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor 's death , as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a ' Sin Eater ' someone who absorbed other 's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the Church was n't happy about his activities . Alex must do what 's right even if it goes against what he believes ... <br /><br />Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co - production was written , produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & did n't really do that much for me if I 'm honest & I usually am , honest that is . Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it 's throughly predictable , excruciatingly dull & boring , really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously . The whole concept is daft & while it thinks it 's clever with it 's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things . There 's the usual religious themes here , morality , sin , forgiveness , faith , belief , prophecy 's , blah , blah , blah you know the sort of thing . Then there 's the twists which are n't hard to see coming , there 's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen , corruption , greed , evil , etc . you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church . The Order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film - making it sucks , a lot . I 'm not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to , as a die - hard horror fan I did n't see much horror in this at all , as a thriller it 's less than thrilling , as a mystery it 's too predictable & there 's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason I can not figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it 's as exciting & action - packed as the average episode of Sesame Street ( 1969 - present ) , harsh maybe but it 's what I think ... <br /><br />Director Helgeland does an OK job , the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab , grayish & dull . For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements , in fact there are n't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason , do n't ask . Forget about any gore or violence as there is n't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable . According the IMDb 's ' Trivia ' section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny , all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they are n't exactly brilliant as it stands now.<br /><br />I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about $ 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just ca n't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good . The whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable . The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul - mouthed comic relief irritates , a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this.<br /><br />The Order , I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much , misses all of it 's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I 'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so do n't do it ! Not recommended .
0 First of all , I have to say I have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something I have n't seen . Taking this into account , I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made , it made me pine for Gigli , My Boss 's Daughter , and any other piece of junk you 've ever seen . BeLyt must be out of his mind , I 've only found one person who liked it and even they could n't tell me what the movie was about . If you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there 's any other way a person could figure this crap out.<br /><br />FOR THE LOVE OF G - D STAY AWAY !
0 Always enjoy great films which deal with the super - natural and the deep thoughts of the Spiritual world . However , this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction . There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell ; all I can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen . The actors , namely : Mark Addy , Thomas Garrett , gave an outstanding performance in his native land England , and we have seen him in " Still Standing " a TV Series . Heath Ledger , played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in " Brokeback Mountain",'05 , gave a great supporting role . Shannyn Sossaman , ( Mara Sinclair ) , did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith . Do n't waste your time , you will be sorry !
0 This really is the worst film I have ever seen . Ever . Period . I actually paid £ 3.50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie . Incredibly dull , poorly acted , dire script , often incoherent and too many scenes that do n't seem to have any relevance to the overall film ( like when Heath Ledger 's priest partner get 's nailed to a wall by a ghost ... what was the point in that scene ? answers on a postcard please ... )<br /><br />I should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it 's entire running time . I would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again.<br /><br />This should be cast into IMDb 's bottom 100 . Hopefully my vote of 1/10 will help it on it 's way .
0 The orders fatal flaw - besides an asinine plot - is that the character 's simply do n't resonate or even react.<br /><br />Two examples : A priest , walking through a graveyard late at night , is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits . After fighting them off , he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up . " Anything wrong ? " His buddy asks , having seen the attack . " Just some demonic spirits - nothing I could n't handle . " No reaction , no surprise , just like he 'd changed a tire . His buddy is equally unconcerned ... must be standard priest training ... [ " And then you put the wafer into their mouths . Any questions ? Ok , moving on , Demon Spirit attacks ... "]<br /><br />Example two : At one point the priests need an answer to a question , and only a demon ( or something , who cared by now ) could provide it . How ? Why , you have to ask a dying man ! So the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing , gasping man . " Hey , do n't kill him ! " or maybe " That 's not nice ! " would have been more realistic then their response . They never ask that they let the man go or stop - in fact , the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance . They ask their question and go.<br /><br />I had to shut it off at that point - my brain was starting to atrophy.<br /><br />Avoid < br /><br / > * / * * * * ( one star out of four)<br /><br / >
0 I wanted to watch this movie , but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off . Character 's do n't seem to react to anything . Consider this : Heath Ledger is walking a night ( through a cemetery I believe ) when he is attacked by spirits , which he drives away . Once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all . When asked what happen he says blandly " attacked by demons , nothing serious . " , as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire.<br /><br />I shut it off when they go to ask something - a demon or something , I stopped caring - a ques ion . The answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death , and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing , dying body question.<br /><br />0 out of * * * * stars .
0 Yes , MTV there really is a way to market Daria . What started as a clever teenage angst-"comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life " sitcom now mutated into a " how you should deal with your problems "- charade . I used to watch Daria all the time and loved it . Now , sitting here after watching the so called " movie " I can only wonder what the point of this all was . Daria tells us how to lead out life in college ? Excuse me ? did n't the point Daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok , as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ? This entire thing reminded me of the scene in " Reality Bites " the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time .
0 This is a truly terrible film.<br /><br />I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it . If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy.<br /><br />Unutterably dull , although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen . Then the credits rolled , and I realised I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.<br /><br />I can not believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb ( over 5 stars when I last saw the voting ) . Are you people voting ironically?<br /><br />Please , please , please do not watch this film !
0 " People I Know " is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast.<br /><br />Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman , a past - his - prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption . But unlike Michael Corleone , it 's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character , his dilemma , or his fate.<br /><br />The film traces Eli 's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause , while distracted by a client 's ( Ryan O'Neal , good in an underwritten part ) latest " dirty laundry " -- in this case , a TV actress companion who 's gotten involved with the wrong people . Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role , although again , the script does n't give her much to work with . As Eli 's sister - in - law , Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics.<br /><br />This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff , and enjoy the other principals . Unfortunately , between the script and direction , " People I Know " is strictly amateurish . Hence its limited theatrical release , and speedy journey to DVD . Consider yourself warned .
0 Very silly movie , filled with stupid one liners and Jewish references thru out . It was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously . A familiar movie plot ... Being at the wrong place at the wrong time . An atrocious subplot , involving Kim Bassinger . Very robotic and too regimented . I have noticed that Al Pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill . A troubleshooter with troubles , but nothing more troubling than Pacinos horrible Atlanta accent . Damage control needs to fix this damage of a film . OK my one liners are bad , but not as bad as the ones in this film . This movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well . Usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons . This movie is unwatchable . I did manage to sit through this . The plot , if written a tad bit better , with , perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot , and even dumber jokes , could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums . What we are left with is a dull , silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish . An embarrassment to all the good Jewish folk everywhere .
0 The movie is about two stories : one is a political murder of a call - girl , the other an upper - class political party . The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino , as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening.<br /><br />If the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama , the performance of Al is memorable : how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man ( as " The Godfather " ) as here as a little servant ( see also " Donnie Brasco").<br /><br />Actually , the big young lion has become a tired old one . This passing of ages is very moving , because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too.<br /><br />But his slowness is only a make - up because he can get back his energy in Church scene.<br /><br />Maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on Al 's talent !
0 The only good thing about " People I Know " is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid performing in . The first big turn - off I had was the way in which Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent ; at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone . Dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot . The supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting , and within an hour I still saw no signs of a sturdy plot . The story overall is a real bore , and I had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake.<br /><br />This movie will surely bore you as well ... avoid at all costs .
0 Much as we all love Al Pacino , it was painful to see him in this movie . A publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career Pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent.<br /><br />The plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels ( and then retreats).<br /><br />Kim Basinger is there , not doing much . Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing . Hard to believe they meant a lot to each other . There 's no energy there.<br /><br />Tea Leone , on the other hand , lit up the screen . She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie , but not enough to save Al from embarrassment .
0 Firstly , I must admit that it is n't a good movie . And , I would never watch this movie if Pacino was n't in it.<br /><br />The movie is about a publicist 's strange 24 hours . And he is overworked , dizzy , sick and sometimes regretful . I do n't like the character at all . It 's really boring , after 20 minutes you may fall asleep . And I do n't understand why Pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie . Just because of money or what?<br /><br />Since I 'm an avid Pacino fan , I bought this 2002 movie People I Know . If you have n't bought it yet , don't even think about it , it 's just a waste of time .
0 In what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 I 've had to endure in a long time , Al Pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure . Not his usual typecasting , which was nice . But his character was just truely pathetic . Someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the Hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy . But in this movie we needed someone to like . And for some reason , every character in the picture said " I do n't know why I like you , Eli " to Al Pacino 's chracter and I could n't even come close to liking him.<br /><br />All the other actors played their usual styles . Tea Leoni , Richard Schiff , and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on TV or in earlier films . And Kim Basinger was n't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind.<br /><br />The movie 's story had no momentum . Most scenes never driving the story forward , but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti - climactic ending . It had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story.<br /><br />Whats the point of the film ? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have you believe " Once Hollywood has you , you ca n't get out . " Yeah right ! And that 's why so many people get fired in Hollywood .
0 Saw this movie in an early preview , and I can not stress enough how bad I thought this film was . From the very beginning , the audience was groaning over Pacino 's awful southern accent . Poor Al looked really , really haggard , and I ca n't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist , or perhaps he just did n't get any sleep before coming to the set . Much worse than Pacino 's close ups , however , is the wretched excuse for a plot . Early in the film we are given indications that Pacino 's character is gay , and I suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended . Later , however , we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger ( both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles ) lust after this elderly , half dead looking , effeminate man with the ridiculous accent . The worst part overall was the main plot thread , which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never , ever care about in the slightest . Because this was a preview I will reserve my final judgment , because of the possibility of re - shoots and editing , but you can bet I will not pay a cent to see this in theaters .
0 Unless somebody enlightens me , I really have no idea what this movie is about . It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it . This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems . And , that´s basically all . When that agent is played by Pacino , one must think that it must be something important . But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is . To one of the best actors in the world , Al Pacino , this is the second movie of the year ( the other is " Simone " ) that deserves the title " the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year " . So , what´s going on , Al ?
0 Al Pacino ? Kim Basinger ? Tea Leoni ? Ryan O'Neal ? Richard Schiff ? My mouth was watering . I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable . 30 minutes in I was having trouble staying awake . 60 minutes in and I hit the record button and fell asleep . Finished watching it the next morning . Should n't have bothered . What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a " Day in the Life ... " Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie . I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep . Dialogue horrible . Continuity non - existent . Camera work could have been done with a hand held Super 8 and looked better . < br /><br />This movie was a total disaster .
0 If it was n't for the bad dialogues and script . I mean , the direction was really in touch with it 's subject . The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life . But in the end , the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together . I would highly suggest not to watch this . Unless you 're a Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and will watch everything he is playing in . Even if the result lately are rather poor . This is , after S1m0ne , a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles .
0 2002 's undeservedly popular " I Love the 80 's " is an inane , idiotic , offensive and downright disgusting pop - culture mess of a show that was the first in a long - line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1 , which was at one time the only real music - oriented channel left on TV ! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter , I forget which one now , of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever . Out of sheer morbid curiosity ( I 'd guess that 's what you 'd call it ) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look - see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap . At least I can honestly say that I was n't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement - level to begin with . The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980 's and what was and was n't culturally significant or popular ( which is what I was expecting to see ) , but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god - awful no - name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills * rolls eyes* ... more like lack - thereof if you ask me ! It 's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so - called " humor " that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one - liner they shot off one after another ! Altogether , I have no problem in saying that " I Love the 80 's " was / is trash of the lowest denominator , and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore .
0 Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue , bad flashbacks , and an almost entirely male cast . The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.<br /><br />O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks ; unfortunately , he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery . Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he , too , is terribly underused.<br /><br />The film has one additional positive aspect , in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies ( such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti ) that many people today are unaware of . Too many of today 's films about WWII paint the Allies as all - good and the Axis as all - evil , when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />This would be a good movie for when you 're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex . If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize , this is the movie for you .
0 There is a reason why this made for British TV movie only appeared at the 1977 Toronto Film Festival . It is dull , plodding and lacking in suspense.<br /><br />Peter OÕTooleÕs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright Harold Pinter are the only elements of interest.<br /><br />Note : Some British film fans will enjoy seeing Philip Jackson , best known for his portrayal of Inspector Japp in the Poirot television series , in one of his earliest roles ....
0 Are you kidding me ? ! A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal ? How talented do you have to be to do this ? She MAY be able to cook but it is NOT portrayed in this half - hour stomach churning painful production . I know she has a Martha - Stewart - esquire empire . So does Warren Buffett but I do n't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and Alpo.<br /><br />She has a nephew named ... Brycer . Brycer ? Stop talking about anyone a name that stupid.<br /><br />More time is spent on " table - scapes " than actual cooking . Who has that kind of time ? ! Silicon should be on your spatula , not on my TV . This show should be on Cartoon Network , NOT Food Network .
0 - A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something -<br /><br />I went to see this movie because it was about non - WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny . It was n't . It is excruciating to watch . Embarrassing . Any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered . < br /><br />I admit I do n't like Jack Black anyway . After this I have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed . The only thing I can come up with where he was o.k . was as a necessary foil to the John Cusack character in ' High Fidelity ' . Jack Black is one of those awful relentless flat - out ham - it - up knockabout guys ( like the little fat one in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis ) who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny . < br /><br />It is not even slapstick . It 's just irritating . It 's not even stoopid , it 's just stupid.<br /><br />I heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too , but if this is anything to go by I wo nt be rushing out to find it on DVD .
0 Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing , but in this movie ... <br /><br />Besides the direction , writing , lack of plot , constant mugging ( aided and abetted by constant straight - on camera shots ) , and a .050 joke batting average , it was still an utter waste of time . The idea sounds promising , but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I 've seen this side of you - tube.<br /><br />I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively . While that 's no doubt true , I really do n't think this movie is meant to be racist . I think that 's it 's more a result of a " creative " team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess . You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera : " Hey look , it 's an ugly Mexican ! Laugh , people ! Please , for the love of all things tenacious , LAUGH!" < br /><br />But put the racism charges aside . When you get down to it , it 's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended , IMO .
0 I 'm sure deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it is n't . You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy , slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.<br /><br />I just sat there through most of the movie thinking " Is this supposed to be funny " and " This is the guy from Tenacious D right ? " . The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer . AT ALL ! It 's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction . You 'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just does n't . I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up . It did n't . 90 minutes later I 'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.<br /><br />It 's like , remember years ago when you 'd see anything with your fave actor in it , even some of their really early pap from before they were famous , and you 'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop . Yeah it 's like that.<br /><br />I've enjoyed some of Jack Black 's earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I 'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man . If you do this to us again Jack I 'm gon na have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something . At the least give you a serious talking to.<br /><br />I know it 's a cliché but this is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and for so many reasons ....
0 I mean , really ... either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie . It 's stupid , ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL.<br /><br />Since i saw the preview i knew it was n't going to be a great movie , i just did n't think it was gon na be that bad ... <br /><br />What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie ? When the actors did n't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny ? . Now we find ourselves with movies like this one , Borat , Little Men , Scary Movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts!!<br /><br />Just skip this piece of garbage < br /><br />P.S. ( sorry for my English )
0 What a disappointment!<br /><br />This film seemed to be trying to copy ' cutting edge ' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy , sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition . Jack Black 's acting / role was self - indulgent and self - regarding ... and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting . The soundtrack was tedious . We are ( WERE ) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration . Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake?<br /><br />We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first!!<br /><br />Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel ?
0 We loved School of Rock and Jack Black . We could n't wait to go and see this movie . It was the only time in my life the movie was so bad I wanted to walk out . My husband hated it too . The only funny parts were in the trailers . My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money . The writing was awful . It had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people who should be utterly offended . The movie was n't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity . The people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry . I made my husband stay because I was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts , but there were n't . Save you money and your time .
0 Jack Black is an annoying character . This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds . Do I have to write eight more lines?Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at , as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black . This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film . I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture . This movie explores Mexican culture - deeply . I just choke on its cultural rudeness : Jack Black is just so rude . A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary into Mexican culture , as it were . Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy , such as myself could seek . I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here.<br /><br />I think IMDb changed my review . Has anyone else had his review changed as well?Just a question .
0 " Nacho Libre " ( 2006 ) < br /><br />Directed By : Jared Hess < br /><br />Starring : Jack Black , Ana de la Reguera , Héctor Jiménez , & Darius Rose < br /><br />MPAA Rating : " PG-13 " ( for some rough action , and crude humor including dialog ) < br /><br />Say what you will about it ( I know some people who despise it to no end ) , but I have always thought that " Napoleon Dynamite " was a funny movie -- not the brightest brick on the wall , but a funny movie , nonetheless . Jack Black is also a very funny man -- irritating at times , yes , and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him , but funny . There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree . So , I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess , the writer and director of " Napoleon Dynamite " , and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage . My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin . Unfortunately , my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie . This plot , had it been done as a skit on some such show as " Saturday Night Live " or possibly even " Mad TV " , would have worked flawlessly . Unfortunately , the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one - joke comedy falls flat.<br /><br />Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord . Feeling shunned by the entire monastery , Nacho ( Black ) , now the monastery 's cook , decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler . As the monastery 's finances hit an all - time low , Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery 's orphanage . This plot sounds so sweet and caring . It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black . Look what he did with " School of Rock " after all . Well , to my displeasure , this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie . It is again Hollywood 's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor  of course , for all I know , maybe that is the general thought of teenagers , as many seemed to enjoy this movie . Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh , but do n't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie . A seven - year - old could make up the same joke.<br /><br />The performances in " Nacho Libre " are actually good . Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic , worthless lines in ever put on paper comical . Unfortunately , this movie just was n't enough for him . It did n't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him . I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before , but now I can say that , not only is she quite talented , but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight . She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well . Héctor Jiménez , who plays Nacho 's bumbling partner , Esqueleto , kept me laughing continuously . He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black 's . Darius Rose , who plays an orphan named Chancho , did n't have many lines , but , what can I say , I just enjoyed him . He was adorable . The rest of the cast did their job . It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub - par movie.<br /><br />"Nacho Libre " just does not work . Its plot is stretched far too thin . The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just do n't work . I very rarely laughed and , if I did , it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast . And that leads me to the bright side of " Nacho Libre " : yes , the cast . This cast was just  well , for lack of a better word , they were on . They all clicked , had excellent chemistry together , and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script . After Jared Hess 's " Napoleon Dynamite " kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie , I was surprised to find myself so often bored with " Nacho Libre " . Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was . All I know is that " Nacho Libre " is not a good movie and yet , because of its cast , it is completely worthless . There is a small reason to watch , if only to watch Jack Black work . But , if you are not a fan of Jack Black , then avoid this movie like the plague . I like Black , but I am done with this movie and with this review.<br /><br />Final Thought : Yikes ! This is Jared Hess 's surprisingly disappointing follow - up to his hysterical " Napoleon Dynamite".<br /><br />Overall Rating : 4/10 ( C+ )
0 This kind of " inspirational " saccharine is enough to make you sick . It telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth . It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it . The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car ; I guess you 'd need such prompting to feel if you 're stupid enough to watch a film as simple - minded and sappy as this . Streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it 's just that --- a display , switched on and off like a light . Because I ca n't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film . Even though it 's based on a true story , and an inspirational one at that I 'm sure , the set - up , execution and performances play like a third - rate TV movie or half - witted high school drama .
0 I saw this movie at a ' sneak preview ' and i must honestly confess that I do not like films with Meryl Streep that much . This picture was the worst . Half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film . I could nt blame them , if this was n't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture . Just before the film goes forward in time about ten years I myself was expecting the credits to appear .
0 What a horrible , horrible film . The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time . Not that I saw much . I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves . Meryl Streep was awful as usual . How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have ? Aidan Quinn 's talents were - as so often - totally wasted . And who told Gloria Estefan she could act ? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes . ( Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school ) . The kids were n't even cute ! Just written in to suit the appalling script . Aaargh ! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once . real horror this one !
0 Hip . Erotic . Wickedly sexy ... whatever . It 's " The Terminator " with werewolves.<br /><br />No , seriously . The cop saves the girl ( waitress ! ) from the big monster and refers to himself as her ' protector ' . The lead actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... there 's a massacre in a police precinct ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and it even contains dialogue along the lines of " You said it yourself , he wo n't ever stop . Never . " The dire script comes from a first - time screenwriter who , thank God , has n't sold anything since this , and it 's all thrown together by famously bad director Richard Friedman.<br /><br />The movie opens in a strip bar ( always a good sign ) , and a mean - looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason , pursued by three cops . One of them is black , and ( shock horror ! ) he 's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes . The film goes downhill for the next hour or so , then picks up a little with some decent action sequences , before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending.<br /><br />For the most part , the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who 's willing to settle for less . If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio , along with some of the supporting cast , shows signs of talent . DarkWolf in his human form is played by gargantuan Kane Hodder -- famous for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the ' Friday the 13th ' movies . He 's decent enough , especially considering he is n't used to speaking roles.<br /><br />It 's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams , who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former ' Power Rangers ' actresses . And it 's unnervingly clear that the editor spent WAY too much time on that scene ... anyway , the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good , and the design of the wolf is n't bad at all . But the CGI is bad . Just plain bad . I mean seriously , if you ca n't reach some level of realism - why bother ? Just throw a little extra money into the make - up ! Aside from the terrible script , this movie does have it 's moments , many of which are unintentionally funny . It 's good for a laugh if you do n't have anything better to do , but just do n't spend any money on it . Please .
0 Dark Wolf ( Quick Review ) Let 's get right to it : This is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh*t on it . It 's just an awful movie . It 's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80 's high school drama film . What 's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf . Kane f*cking Hodder . Someone 's trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his film career ... <br /><br />Anyway , former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf , too . It 's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world 's worst looking werewolf in it . But it does have moments of near - rampant nudity . But that 's about all . Want to know more ? Okay , the werewolf is generally an ugly - looking black blur zipping around the screen . And when we 're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence , we 're presented with something that resembles a full - motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation . The first Playstation . The CG animation is really that primitive . Only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit . 2/10<br /><br />www . ResidentHazard.com
0 The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library ( and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it ) , and despite the plethora of tits and ass , it did n't take long to realize that the fast - forward button was my friend . Terrible direction , pedestrian camera work , sporadically bad - to - nearly - passable acting , chintzy effects , and one of the worst screenplays I 've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life ( such as it was , horribly crippled and mutilated ) in a long , long time . Best laughs actually come from the " Making of ... " featurette , in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special , instead of something that wo n't be utterly forgotten next week . Wait ! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi " The Birds " Hedren , of all people , into doing a bit part , along with Kane " Friday the 13th " Hodder ! How this came to pass , I 'll never know , and to be honest , I do n't really care . Watch at your own risk , and do n't say you have n't been warned . This is film - making at its pretentious , craven worst . It only gets a 2 from me for having some good - looking naked women , and even then , just barely .
0 This move was on TV last night . I guess as a time filler , because it sucked bad ! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way . ( Not bad tits and ass though ) . But the story is too ridiculous for words . The " wolf " , if that is what you can call it , is hardly shown fully save his teeth . When it is fully in view , you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI , because the wolf runs like he 's running in a treadmill , and the CGI fur looks like it 's been waxed , all shiny : ) < br /><br />The movie is full of gore and blood , and you can easily spot who is going to get killed / slashed / eaten next . Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed , they did n't do a good job at it.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the actors ... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds . But then again , if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks , then hey , where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall boring and laughable horror .
0 Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story . Within 15 minutes , the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines , so there is absolutely no mystery , which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense . The only half - way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film , so we 're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things . Low budget films ca n't afford expensive special effects , so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive , but were at least a valid attempt . The creature suit is terrible , as seen when it falls to the sidewalk , and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes , which are n't even the red color shown in mirror shots . The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired , with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator . The last action sequence takes place in a police station , also a rip - off from Terminator , with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf does n't smash into . In the end , the girl calls the hero " a good Protector " , but he gets both his partners , the original Protector , and at least three other civilians , not to mention a dozen cops , all killed without getting a decent shot off , in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun . But here 's the real clincher for bad writing : They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes . Instead , they took it into custody ? ! ?
0 Why bother seeing this movie , if you have great movies to see . It is a total waste of time and money . The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to watching it . Everything in it is BAD . Actors were bad . Script was REALLY bad . The story is stupid . And the worst CGI EVER . The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club . One interesting thing that , there is a characther that we wish that he dies because , he is so stupid that we get enough of him.(I do n't remember the name but was the BOYFRIEND of the " Chosen One".)<br /><br />NOTE : If you want to see a good movie , this movie is n't the right choice . 0-Stars out of 10
0 DarkWolf tells the tale of a young waitress named Josie ( Samaire Armstrong ) who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend Mary ( Tippi Hedren ) is killed by a Werewolf , you see Werewolves actually exist in modern day America & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the Werewolf threat headed up by Detective Steve Turley ( Ryan Olosio ) who has the difficult task of telling Josie that she is in fact a pure blooded Werewolf herself & that a so - called ' dark prince ' Werewolf ( Kane Hodder ) wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood Werewolves that will take over the entire world , or something like that . Understandably Josie has a hard time believing it , that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes . It 's up to Werewolf cop Steve to save Josie , the day & the world ... <br /><br />Co - executive produced & directed Richard Friedman I thought DarkWolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that did n't really do anything for me . The script by Geoffrey Alan Holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there 's a Werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it 's pretty much down hill all the way I 'm afraid . For a start it 's slow going , it 's dull , it 's predictable & it 's populated with highly annoying character 's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the Werewolf they do n't , I have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead . The script is dumb & does n't explain itself , why has Josie never turned into a Werewolf before ? Is she really the only one ? Why ca n't this ' dark prince ' find another female Werewolf ? There are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half - way through but you get the idea anyway , as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least.<br /><br />Director Friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & does n't really improve the film as a spectacle . Now let 's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in DarkWolf are far from special , the Werewolf transformation is achieved using CGI & it 's among the worst looking CGI I 've ever seen , seriously a Playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics . It 's easily the worst Werewolf transformation I 've ever seen , An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ) was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light - years ahead of the ones seen in DarkWolf , who says special effects have improved over the years ? The animatronic puppet effects are n't much better either although at least there 's something psychical on screen . The gore is n't up to much after a gory opening kill there 's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else . Thre 's a fair amount of female nudity if that 's your thing but do n't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it , is it really worth it?<br /><br />Technically DarkWolf is alright apart from possibly the worst CGI effect ever , it 's reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values . The acting is what you 'd expect really.<br /><br />DarkWolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable TV stations , I did n't think it was as bad as some but it 's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they 're both horrible still ...
0 I watched this film alone , in the dark , and it was full moon outside ! I did n't do it in purpose , it just happened in this way . So all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me ! ! Well , it did n't , in fact i wanted to shut off the DVD player after only 8 minutes , but i thought come on give it a chance , unfortunately i did . The acting was awful , the only one with some decent acting was Samaire Armstrong . The plot is not original , if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before . Some scenes did n't make sense at all , and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer ! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie . The ( scary ) scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology , yet some good movies were made back then ! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie , i thought could n't they put some money in this and make it decent ? ! ! I could n't agree more with the ratings that the movie got , it is also my rating for it , 3 out of 10 .
0 Recap : Full moon . A creature , a huge werewolf , is on the hunt . Not for flesh , not for blood ( not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though ) , but for a mate . He is on the hunt for a girl . Not any girl though . The Girl . The girl that is pure ( and also a werewolf , although she does n't know it yet ) . Three , well check that , two cops ( after the first scene ) and an old bag lady is all that can stop it , or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf . This particular powerful werewolf , Darkwolf , is closing in on the girl . If he gets her , mankind is doomed . Now the cops has to find the girl , convince her not only that there is someone , a werewolf nonetheless , that wants to rape her , and perhaps kill her , but that she is a werewolf herself . And then they got to stop him ... <br /><br />Comments : This is one for the boys , the teenage boys . A lot of scenes with semi - nude girls more or less important for the plot . Mostly less . Well I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is ( expectedly ) thin . And unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking . One usually turns to two main themes . Nudity . Check . And then special effects . Hmm ... Well there are some things that you might call effects . They 're not very special though . In fact , to be blunt , they are very bad . The movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds . They could n't afford clothes for some of the girls ;) , and the effects are cheap . Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form , obviously done by computer , are really bad . You might overlook such things . But the Darkwolf in itself is very crude too , and you never get to see any killings . Just some mutilated corpses afterwards . And there is surprisingly little blood about , in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters . Most of the times they do well , but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters ( or actors ) just looses it . A few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above . Like the poor effects , or the poor budget ( ? ) . That could explain why there is precious little shooting , even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight ( and not moving ) . But hey , when you 're in real danger , there nothing that will save your life like a good one - liner ... <br /><br />Unfortunately that ca n't explain moments when the Cop , Steve , the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem , the werewolf that is , runs away , when the only things he can be sure of , is that the werewolf is coming for the girl , who is just beside him now , and that he can not let it have her . But sure , it let the makers stretch the ending a little more ... <br /><br />But I would n't mind seeing none of the lead actors / actresses get another try in another movie.<br /><br />Well . To give a small conclusion : Not a movie that I recommend.<br /><br />3/10
0 This is the prime example of low budget , winning over what would be a good story line . Let 's bring back Samaire Armstrong ( having seen her work on the O.C. I know she can do better ) , then find a better script and budget.<br /><br />The special effects were so bad , and mostly badly computer generated , that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on - screen . And Samaire Armstrong 's ( alert!)changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad GCIF figure before she even begins to change(Final Fantasy 's humans , as well as Pixar 's made these laughable , think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll).<br /><br />The story of was interesting , though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new . As it also got into the balance between evil , ( maybe ) not so evil , and the possible end of human - kind should the two lines mate . The subplot of a " book of werewolf linage " which effected some of the other characters in a spell - like manner for a while was effective , but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past . < br /><br />Bring in a better script and direction , and I 'd come back again .
0 I have nothing to comment on this movie It is so bad that I had to put my first comment on IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting , instead of watching this " movie " ... anything will do , even stare at the walls is better.<br /><br />And because I have to write minimum 10 lines of text , i tell you also is a low budget movie , bad acting , no name actors , a stupid mutt as the wolf , and so on ... Also the story brings nothing new , the special effects are made in the 80 's style.<br /><br />The movie is almost as bad as the movie " Megalodon".<br /><br />So have fun ! ;) ( not watching this movie )
0 Well , no , not really . Its not really a good movie , but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be . I really did n't feel ripped off of my rental money , and sometimes that s all you can ask for . The plot is OK , nothing brilliant or new , the acting is pretty bad , but the cast is pretty . The directing is passable , but the effects are horrible , especially the werewolf effects , which in a werewolf movie , is a pretty big problem . There was a fairly decent amount of nudity , which to me is a pretty good thing , but it was n't all that hot . All in all , its a fairly average direct to video movie , not the worst film I 've ever seen and if you 're bored a genre fan , check it out sometime . I 'd even watch it again.<br /><br />Bonus fact for horror geeks , Kane Hodder ( Jason Vorhees in a few of them ) plays the werewolf .
0 Where to start ? ! . . . I feel ... violated ! That s right , violated ! I just spent 1.5hrs of my life , 1.5hrs that I could have spent doing something more useful , like watching paint dry , on this so called horror flick.<br /><br />Its not scary , its not funny , its not dramatic , its no action , its nothing ... <br /><br />Its predictable , its boring , its tragic ... <br /><br />I might come of a bit harsh here , but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no , do n't watch it ... unless you want to feel violated also .
0 This flick reminded me of those lame " erotic thrillers " I used to stay up late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13 . I 'd label this flick softer - core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder . There is , however , a ton of nudity- the opening scene is in a strip club , we see Kane Hodder 's keester ( or at least a stunt butt ) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the Munster 's for a costume . 13 year old boys rejoice.<br /><br />Other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I 've seen in years . The shots look like FMV 's from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality . The wolf is too bad to be explained and , despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way , way too many times.<br /><br />The plot and acting make no sense . There is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid - werewolves- the Darkwolf is the latter but from what I can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do- look human , change to a wolf an kill people . The Darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly ca n't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches . Once more , this skills proves less than useful since the Darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched , met or even saw as best I can tell . The mate does n't know she 's a werewolf and she 's fighting the transformation or something.<br /><br />You'd think it 'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but , well they did . Want quality low - end werewolf - ism , go rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T&A this is your flick .
0 Hi , I 'm a friend of werewolf movies , and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like " hmm , simple and nice name to it at least . Althou ... i wonder why i have n't heard of it before." < br /><br />First of all , the movie starts with tits . Lots of tits . Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to . Who cares about a werewolf effect , just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots!<br /><br />So , about the mysterious darkwolf character ( a little spoilers ahead , but who really cares ... ) He 's your average everyday biker . Not even super - tough looking , but like the old wise woman says in the movie " he is far more powerful and dangerous than you 've ever faced before . " Just by describing her a tattooed biker - type of a guy . Pretty original . I even had look twice when they first used the " red glowing eyes " SPECIAL EFFECT ! I mean my god , that " lets - plant - red - dots - on - eyes - with - computer " effect has been used since the seventies . It looks plain ugly here ! And do n't get me started with the werewolf 3D - CGI . As said before , like an bad and old video game.<br /><br />And finally , as i do like werewolf films , like i said . They prettymuch always build a werewolf - legend of their own . Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well , about some silly legends of hybrid - werewolves and the ancient bloodline . BUT . It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement " the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched " starts random - slashing . Which just does n't make any sense , why even bother telling us the rules of killing , when they are n't even gon na play by them ... Aplus the wolf - point - of - view shots are made with a sony handycam or something , filming mostly the floor and walls . Just add growling noises and you 've got a super werewolf effect . The gore is partially OK . But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand , just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims , it just does n't do the trick for me ... <br /><br />Truly , WHO gives money to make these heaps of junk straight - to - video horrortitles , they are n't even funny - kind of bad movies , just sad .
0 This is the absolutely worst piece of crap I 've ever had to watch - actually it was so bad that I just HAD to watch it : -)<br /><br />The CGI is sooo bad it 's fun ! It 's not even close to the shitty CGI animations in Spawn , that 's how bad it is , har har har ... <br /><br />I'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on DVD , but I guess they 'll get more money out of it that way , 'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars.<br /><br />It 's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it.<br /><br />See it and laugh !
0 Man , this movie sucked big time ! I did n't even manage to see the hole thing ( my girlfriend did though ) . Really bad acting , computer animations so bad you just laugh ( woman to werewolf ) , strange clips , the list goes on and on . Do n't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie ? And I do n't mean all the naked ladys ... It 's something about the light or something ... This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women , but not because it 's an original movie white a nice plot twist . My final words are : Do n't see it ! It 's not worth the time . If you wanna see it because the nakedness there 's lots of better ones to see !
0 I thought I was going to watch a scary movie .. and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie . In the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf I thought they was kidding . Todays computer games have ten times better animations . Low budget , is a fitting comment . I would recommend Wolf ( 1994 ) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie . It has good special effects as they should be ( human transforming to werewolf ) . Unless you wish to have good laugh I would not recommend you to watch this movie . This movie is a joke .
0 There is n't much to say about this film , it is horrible.<br /><br />The acting and dialog are way far away from even decent , the story of the hybrid werewolf 's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there.<br /><br />CGI is something you would n't like to see . It so amateurish that it makes me vomit.<br /><br />The only good thing on the DVD was in the Extras . The gag reel . Everything else , just waste of time and money . I hope noone will buy this , this is not even worth renting.<br /><br />Just stay away of this .
0 Let me start by saying that I 'd read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect . Still , I was surprised by just how bad it was . < br /><br />I am a big werewolf fan , and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one . Most of them have sub - par effects , poor acting , and weak storylines ( at best rehashed from earlier films ) . So far , with the possible exception of some of the later " Howling " series films , this is the worst of the lot.<br /><br />First , the story . It 's been quoted several times in reviews on this site , so I wo n't go into specifics . However , it is very obvious that the writer(s ) had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters . As so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves " above " such fare , they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos . That 's fine , but a non - horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them . The plot feels like a parody of werewolf films , and the events depicted just ring so false that I felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted . TV news footage , for example , never pans away from the reporter to close - up on someone in the crowd behind them . Give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign . And that 's just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />As for effects , I have NEVER seen a less believable werewolf . I 'd have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in crepe hair . The beast they used look a great deal like ... well , like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics . And , I know that many people have already criticized the CG , but my God it was awful . One scene features a woman changing , and starts with a completely CG version of the actress , nude but for some reason without nipples . My first thought was , " hey , why is one of the characters from ' ReBoot ' turning into a silly looking werewolf?" < br /><br />Anyway , I like to look for positives in any film , and there were a few . The cinematography was passable ( the film was shot all - digital , which is interesting ) and some of the performances were not terrible . It was also interesting seeing Tippi Hedron as the world 's most well made - up homeless woman , and Kane Hodder as the title bad guy . Also , the Yellow Power Ranger got all growed up and ... well , damn . And if you 're looking for skin , there 's some pretty tasty examples . This ends the male - pig segment of the review.<br /><br />Overall , if you want a good werewolf film , try " An American Werewolf in London " , the original " The Howling " , " Dog Soldiers " , or even " The Wolfen " ( though that one 's got more wolf than were ) . If you 're a lycanthrope completest , then take a gander . Otherwise , give this one a miss .
0 All the bare chested women in the world could n't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish . With the derisory acting , equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match ; this movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre . It is supposed to be serious , which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent . Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead.<br /><br />0 out of 10 !
0 This is only the second time I 've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film . The first time was for probably the best movie I 've ever seen and that was for Memento.<br /><br />Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento , as in the worst film I 've had the misfortune to see . Apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash - pile that it is.<br /><br />Let 's see , apalling effects , cliched script , bad acting and about 90 minutes too long . My wife and I laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad . Amazingly I watched it to the end , how I did that I do n't know ! AVOID ! ! !
0 When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train . The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring . Its not that I do n't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact , it 's just that in this film they are very boring . If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you 'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you . It is realistic but you would n't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie .
0 This is n't a movie . It is a collection of unrelated , ill - conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini - DV camera . In fact , I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair , dead - pan stare , ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase.<br /><br />If you made it further than the ten minutes I did , do n't bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the European Artiste mentality praised above . This is a true and complete waste of time , money and film that would have made William One - Shot Beaudine cringe.<br /><br />The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum - packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity.<br /><br />What 's next ? Six directors shooting social intercourse at the Wal - Mart snack counter ?
0 If you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex , this film is for you . On the plus side the lead actor / actress ( newcomer transsexual ) does have an interesting screen presence , but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie - if that . Essentially this film is about 3 social outcasts ( transexual prostitute , male hustler , and Russian , gay immigrant ) who somehow have developed a bond . Why is not clear . We are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street . Right ! ! And Anna Nicole Smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy ! The filmmaker shows a gritty , unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life . Quite a fantasy , but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side . In sum , no plot , no truth and no real reason to spend much time here . Unless of course you just like to revel in the kink ! ! !
0 This story is about the romantic triangle between a nth . African male prostitute , a French transsexual prostitute ( Stephanie ) and a Russian waiter who speaks no French and never seems to shave.<br /><br />As a film it is dull , dreary and depressing , shot either on foggy , overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors , where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence . And yes , I know , it 's because the white balance was out . Everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard , shabby and dirty . Bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing . Moles , greasy hair . Yuk . Bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex.<br /><br />And the story ? Well , Stephanie 's mother is dying . All three characters go back to Stephanie 's home village where , through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors , we see a bit of Stephanie 's childhood as a boy called Pierre . The mother dies . Well ... and that 's about it , really . Character development is kept to a minimum , as is the denouement of the story . < br /><br />I suppose the storyline is not linear ( it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs ) but really , after paying my seven euros I do n't feel like having to construct the film myself : that 's what the director takes my money for . To expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty , so to speak , is asking way too much.<br /><br />This film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made , above all , from a desire to epater les bourgeois ( ie shock the straights ) . I can see how it was a shoo - in for the Berlin Film Festival , and I can see why it got nowhere .
0 Medellin is a fabulous place to live , work , and study . I 've been there twice , and never did I hear anything about guerrilla activities , paramilitaries taking tourists hostage , or anything of the sort . There are " invisible police , " but it is * not * a Big Brother system . There are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life , but they do not hassle someone without good reasons.<br /><br />La Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters . The directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra , and when a " character " dies , there is genuine pathos . It is difficult to imagine , however , that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro , a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country.<br /><br />La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia ; there are , of course , things to be wary of such as petty crime , but when one considers pickpocketing happens in " modern " cities such as London , New York , or Tokyo , Colombia does n't seem that different after all . Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war - torn country is now prospering more than ever .
0 One of those Thank - God - I - don't - live - there documentaries . This one tells of two warring factions in Colombia , guerrillas and paramilitaries , and the surrounding peoples of Medellin.<br /><br />Guns , drugs and death run rampant . The guys , no older than 22 , not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail . The girls  not women , girls  always react the same way when one of them is killed , with tears and screaming . You scratch your head ; what did they expect , really ? I do n't know what 's more disturbing : the nightly shoot - outs and civil unrest , or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are . Or , seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer , being all of what , 10 ? If you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more , be more , how many would choose not to stay?<br /><br />Based on this documentary , all , I 'm afraid .
0 Before I start , let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing , which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some . So , it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference . I have also not read the corresponding book ; I 'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context.<br /><br />Potential minor spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories ( the likes of Blade Runner , 12 Monkeys , etc . ) , but I did not enjoy this movie at all . While it started out mildly intriguing , it became tedious by the time it was only half - way finished . There are all sorts of problems ; let 's start with what is probably the most severe : the dialogue . The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences ; if they are n't shouting each other 's names for the n - th time , they are usually grunting monosyllables ( " Kanedaaa ! " , " Tetsuoooo ! " , " Huh ? " , " Grrr " , etc . ) . This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two - dimensional . It does n't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals.<br /><br />The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo - philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards . There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems haphazard , thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci - fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever.<br /><br />What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction . Not that there 's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction , of course ; but in this case you 'll find yourself asking " what 's the point of it all , and how long until it 's over " . Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason.<br /><br />The ending resembles the one in 2001 - a bizarre string of images that , far from resolving or explaining anything , leave the viewer feeling he 's just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours . I 'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art ; but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes . ( Some of the music was also quite interesting ) . Unfortunately it 's all style and no substance.<br /><br />Tired of Disney ? Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with " adult " themes ? I 'm sad to say you 're more likely to find that sort of thing in " South Park " .
0 From around the time Europe began fighting World War II , until the war 's end , Hollywood ( with significant prodding from the government ) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army , by making the life of a serviceman appear " cool . " This is by far the sloppiest , implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work , you get the best food , and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio . I am far too young to have participated in WWII , but I think that there was more to it than that . There is the barest cat 's whisker of a plot , and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day 's leading acts.<br /><br />I think that by 1943 , even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie . While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment , I ca n't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war , were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones ' sacrifice .
0 This is a truly awful " B " movie . It is witless and often embarrassing . The plot , the basic " making into show business " routine , is almost nonexistent . In fact , the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942 , including the Mills Brothers , Count Basie , Duke Ellington , Bob Crosby , and Freddy Slack . Each group gets about the standard three minutes , the exception being the Mills Brothers , who for some reason warranted two numbers . Ann Miller does n't get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film , and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda.<br /><br />The most interesting moment in the film , in my view , occurred in the Duke Ellington segment . The band appears to be playing in a train , standing in awkward positions . ( In the deep South at the time , the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling . ) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke , and Harry Carney may also be identified . In the last moments of the film , trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an " uncle Tom , " bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way Willy Best did in many films . For modern viewers , especially jazz fans , this homage to segregation is sad indeed . Some movies go best unseen .
0 Anyone notice that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions.<br /><br />1 . The angry eyes look he gives every enemy . 2 . The holding of the hands to face , mouth agape and frightened eyes . 3 . The smiling Tommy Turnbull.<br /><br />I have to say that i pretty much hate this show , i do n't watch it but it 's like Code Lyoko , we 've all watched at least one , i must say that this show is borderline racist , uninteresting and pointless.<br /><br />every episode ends with robotboy winning , except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack.<br /><br />The jokes are pretty crude too , i think it 's mostly people saying the word " Suck " or farting , i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too.<br /><br />Isn't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate , and the other uses a chain , for god sake , what kind of school is he going to . Not to mention his older brother , who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities.<br /><br />The whole show i feel is ripping off megas XLR and Fosters . Like you could say the trio of coop , jamie and Kiva , as well as Robotboy being similar to Megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he 's free spirited despite being a robot.<br /><br />There is simply no appeal to this show , i 'm surprised that it 's still running .
0 Now , I like sci - fi cartoons . However , when " Robotboy " appeared in Canada in late 2006 , I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled . The characters are generic and stereotypical ( Do they REALLY need to make an African - American man wear tiger - stripe print clothing and speak in a Jamacian accent ? WHY are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting ? Does the mother HAVE to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain ? ) to the point where things become unrealistic , predictable , gross and sometimes disturbing . There are heavy similarities to , even stabs , at Astro Boy . Allow me to explain ( dub names for the young ) : Robotboy / Astro , Kamikaze / Tenma , Constantine / Shadow , Gus / Abercrombie , Tommy / Alejo , Lola / Zoran+Kennedy , Moshimo / O'Shay , and it so on . Brief resemblances to " My Life As A Teenage Robot " , " Star Wars " , " Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles " , " Kamen Riders " , " Sailor Moon " and co. are afoot . Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotyping . Do n't even get me started on the innuendos . I 'll just say they 're hidden and quite dirty . But seriously . Do n't even try watching this . Especially if you like Astro Boy .
0 When I first watched Robotboy , I found it fresh and interesting , but then I noticed , that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself , what is good / bad . Episodes became predictable . And main characters are not interesting . Again we see a hyper - smart boy , beaten by his older brother , parents who do n't understand their kid , and his friends : girl and fat boy . Also this show has no logic . A super - modern robot who works on two AA - size batteries , and can use a lot of weapons . But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super - activated modes . We see two different robots , and it declines main idea of the show : " Robot must learn how to behave himself in human society "
0 When I first saw a small scene of it in some announcements , I thought the show would be entertaining to watch . The little robot guy does look kinda cute . The style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows . Before the show aired , I studied it through some sources . There , I did became slightly dismayed . The three children ( Tommy , Gus and Lola ) are voiced appropriately but Robotboy is an exception . It would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad . One good example is Robot Jones , a robot character from " Whatever Happened To Robot Jones ? " The show is n't bad really . But the way Robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism . Thus , I do n't watch it much .
0 The dudes at MST3 K should see this dog of a film . It 's basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who ca n't land any acting gigs . And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver . So what does this dumb actor do ? He dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a L.A. surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles . You 'll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie 's inadvertently funny scenes . Like when the actor dude 's girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like , " How could you do this to me ? " And why is she crying ? Cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs . This movie makes no sense at ALL ! The actor who played the governor on Benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog . This movie will crack you up , trust me . You talking ' to me ? !
0 ok . for starters , taxi driver is amazing . this , this is not taxi driver or amazing . what it is is bad . but i thought it was bad funny , which means that it did have some redeeming qualities . like the dialogue ... wow . there was more or less no plot , the characters were all stupid , and the movie was preachy . there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence , which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder . i ca n't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie . yeah , it 's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie , or at least can try to .
0 Despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy , the inconsistencies of its main character , Bronson Green , aspiring New York actor easily turned L.A. phony , makes it hard to take the story seriously . Green , who is constantly rejected by Los Angeles casting agents for being obsolete ( i.e. too New York when the 80s is looking for big , blonde , and dumb ) , he finds success comes easily when he 's willing to succumb to falsifying his image . Unfortunately , the new hair dye and pacified " surfer " attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the Jericho Church , which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the Aryan nation . Green is willing to easily forget his past , and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years , in order to be the Church 's new spokesman . This makes no sense , seeing as how principled our character initially is . It is this sudden , and loose change in character , coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened , DeNiro - obsessed ( as his Taxi Driver character ) form who is able to battle the villains . A noble attempt on the filmmakers , but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious.<br /><br />The other characters , too , are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily -- the psychotic paranoia of the Church leader , the self - interested actress girlfriend ( the first girlfriend Bronson has when he 's in L.A. ) , and the new blonde girlfriend who 's character lacks so much development , she is , for the most part , just a walking , talking void . We are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters . But there is really little development of any of them.<br /><br />The other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action . Much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters , obviously , and later we see Bronson 's difficulties with breaking into the L.A. acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection . But after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted , there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens.<br /><br />For films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism , this was not one done with enough credibility .
0 You talking ' to Me ? ( 1987 ) is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who I have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor . He has a heavy jones for Taxi Driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big . When he learns the hard facts of life , he does what everyone else does , changes his image ! He goes from good fella to a surf 's up dude over night . His friend ca n't believe the change ( but he scores with Faith Ford and get 's a cool paying gig ) . Can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big?<br /><br />This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once . An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution . Who knows , maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this movie . Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump.<br /><br />xx
0 I could n't relate to this film . It failed to engage me either intellectually , emotionally or aesthetically . The dialogue was very dense and uninvolving . I could n't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and I 'm finding it hard to find much that 's positive to say about it.<br /><br />I've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology . I 'll admit that , as an atheist , I probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of Catholicism , but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and do n't rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs .
0 It is not obvious from viewing this film ( so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it ) but this presentation on the realities of Islam , and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non - Muslims is lacking objectiveness , and also completely fails to factor in the human condition . It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non - Muslims , but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam , will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system . There is reason to call much about the presenters into question , such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism ; do n't swallow it all , hook , line , and sinker , without some thinking of your own.<br /><br />One specific , for instance , is researching the person Walid Shoebat ; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem . There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions . I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim . I have never read the Koran . I am not a Christian , nor a member of _ any _ faith . But I am an intelligent and discerning human . While the film is quite disturbing , in its presentation of how SOME Muslims view their obligation to Islam ; I remind you that there is more to Islam than the views of the fundamentalists . Just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians , so , too , there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among Jews and Muslims.<br /><br />When you watch this film , you need to have the salt shaker on hand . One grain will not be enough , you 'll need more . Please use your own mind and think for yourself , research what is presented , and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video . There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together , indicating a definite bias . Be your own brain .
0 I have been using IMDb for years and I never wanted to get involved in the commentary of movies  until now . This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say . I am not a Muslim , nor am I an Islamic studies expert , but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one - sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses . < br /><br />The problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary . Most of the documentaries that I have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation . This is certainly the case with Islam : What the West Needs to Know . Yes , there are fundamentalists around the world , and some of them are Muslim , but to build a documentary about all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading . This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more.<br /><br />For those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary , here are several points that may help . < br /><br />There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary.<br /><br />The documentary focuses on the Middle East , but more Muslims live outside of that region . More Muslims live in China , believe it or not , than in Saudi Arabia . About 40 % of all Muslims live in Pakistan , Bangladesh , India and Indonesia.<br /><br />The translation of the Qur'an used in the documentary is a questionable one . I watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking . I had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now I know why . Surrah 98:6 is a good example . The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell . But the translation I have reads instead : " Those who reject Truth among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in hellfire . " The difference is that those who reject Truth are those people who know about God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyways . < br /><br />The movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam , but this is not true . Although it is true that much comes from the Qur'an and Hadith , Islam also recognizes a concept called ' Urf or " normative behavior . " Obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways , but ' Urf is meant to be " good " behavior , what an average person would consider right or wrong.<br /><br />The documentary presents Shar'ia ( Islamic Law ) as being one unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow . This is simply not true . There are many Islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law . < br /><br />The Hadith tradition is similar . There are thousands of Hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others . Using the Hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate , real and applicable , is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say   which is what the documentary did.<br /><br />What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem , not Islam or any other religion . Christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on . I know this is not the same as suicide bombing , just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem . If you feel you have THE answer , then everyone else must be wrong . But if you feel you have AN answer you can work together with other people 's views about politics , religion , God , or whatever .
0 The " documentary " , and we use that term loosely apparently , summarizes that Muslims are trying to violently take over the world . Then states that any Muslim that does n't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face ! Also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them . What the West NEEDS to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets . If you are looking for an actual documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle - East I would look elsewhere . Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources .
0 This video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam . It 's a pity that the people who did it really believe that American people is so dumb to believe in it , perhaps , as an American citizen , every person must protest against this kind of crap . If you want to know the truth about Islam , do n't let nobody tell you ... THE QURAN IS PUBLIC ! you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it 's true or false ... <br /><br />The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related . The music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see , even if they do n't really understand what 's going on in there . They use images that are misplaced from their original content.<br /><br />To end the comment I would like to make a reflexion ... Do n't you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world ?
0 That 's pretty ridiculous , I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the U.S , U.k , and all over the world . The religion has over a billion followers . I Myself born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society . I am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world . I have know many Muslims from all over and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan .. I have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media ... I wonder why ... Also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion . Its a religion of one billion people , and these are less than one percent , I am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK , IRA and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge , personal , or business matters through their so called religion
0 This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one . And I 'm Jewish.<br /><br />Anbody go to journalism school ? Read an editorial ? Freshman year rhetoric ? These alarmist assertions , presented in a palatable way , might prove persuasive . But by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments , nor viable ( or any at all ) solutions , few sources and each of dubious origin , makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe.<br /><br />And thank goodness for that -- I would n't want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this racist claptrap.<br /><br />A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it .
0 Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists , add some commentary by a bunch of uber - right reactionaries , ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a Moslem , and presents this as the theology of Islam . Maybe their next film will involve interviewing Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church , adding commentary by some militant atheist " scholars , and call their film " What the World Needs to Know About Christianity . " Ultimately , this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism . Do n't waste your time and money ; just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you 'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis .
0 The first ( and only ) time I saw " Shades " was during a Sneakpreview . It had n't even been in premiere . I remember there was someone of the directors staff there , do n't even remember who . It was a Belgian movie , we never heard of it , so we were quite neutral , not knowing what to expect . Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he 's stands miles ahead all the rest . He plays an actor who 's star has long stopped rising . He 's helping to realise a movie in Belgium entitled " Shades".<br /><br />As soon as the movie started , we noticed how much swearing there is . Nothing against the occasional swear word . However this was way beyond annoying . Whenever Rourke uses the F * * * word to express something , it comes naturally . However , when someone from the cast , a non - English speaker uses the F * * * * or S * * * word , it becomes arrogant and aggressive.<br /><br />We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F and S words . Everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre . And we had to give a vote , but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 , and we were looking for the -10 .
0 This is a very sad movie . Really . Nothing happens in this movie . The Script is bad ! ! ! I guess they 've just copy - paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages . The Producers must have thought let 's create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium . They did n't succeed . Now in the third week it is only running in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something . In the past we have had really good movies in Belgium , like Daens . Shades is a waste of your time . Maybe you could sneak in the theater after you 've seen a real movie . If you 've seen 10 minutes of Shades , you 've seen it all . It was advertised to death on local radio and TV . I hope it will disappear in the Shades soon .
0 The first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in Belgium , are fine : you see real chaos on the set , a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown , the cool has been - director ( Mickey Rourke ) , the bad tempered star , etc . You have seen everything before , but it 's well done . BUT THEN ! The rest of the time the film just repeats itself : the same ten minutes over and over again . No climax , no dramatic development , no good acting , not even bad acting , it just goes on and on and on . Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f**ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet . Altogether , that makes 12 good minutes.<br /><br / >
0 This movie was advertised on radio , television , magazines , etc . Almost every hour or every issue . So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high . But oh boy , how sad this movie is ! It is a movie in Hollywood style about a movie in a movie . Shades shows so clear we are n't ready to produce ' big Hollywood movies ' . I am not a movie critic , but I think a good movie starts with a good script . And the script is a nightmare . Like my subject line says , it is nothing , and then looped . You could just stare to the television as well , without really seeing anything . That was the feeling we 've got when we saw Shades . Shades is a BAD PRODUCTION ! ! !
0 " Fly Me To The Moon " has to be the worst animated film I 've seen in a LONG TIME . That 's saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now . The story is to be generous ... trite . The voice acting is atrocious , Too cute sounding . The humor is of the Romper Room variety . The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television.<br /><br />It gets a 2 only because of it 's OK 3-D visuals . Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but We 've seen much better in the past . I also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes . While that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time . It seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators.<br /><br />I will say this though , It had a pretty cool soundtrack . And for the record my son was n't too crazy about it either . Bad movie .
0 It is pretty surreal what these flies can do ... eh well ... this is a cartoon , so anything can happen in it.<br /><br />At first I must tell you that I love animated movies . Unfortunately this year 's repertoire is very weak . This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:<br /><br />1 ) I quoted the tag line . It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects . Well , I did not see any , at least not something special I never saw before.<br /><br />2 ) The " flies " in this movie look nothing like real flies . At least they could 've make them black . But cyan flies , seriously ? With giant heads and slim torsos?<br /><br />3 ) The story . I guess it was written for 6 year old kids . I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.<br /><br />4 ) Excessive patriotism . For example : " They are American files after all ! " Oh , give me a break .
0 Okay , so , someone , somewhere , a few years ago , thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon . So they did . Someone , somewhere , was an idiot.<br /><br />I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware . As far as I can tell , the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on . The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills , like a good rocket launch always does ( my Popular Mechanics flying - car gearhead blood still runs strong ) and the 3D was pretty effective . The CG was n't Pixar - quality , but it was generally good . The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics , with some half - assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour ( hippie flies , African - American flies with giant afros and black shades , etc . ) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads ( although they made suitably gross squelching noises).<br /><br />The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework , relying on offensive and outdated clichés ( 60s gender politics including mostly - useless female characters , racial stereotypes , evil Russians , a fat fly who only wants to eat , grade - two level gross - out humour ) . In a movie aimed for IMAX , they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they did n't get their physics right ( zero - g in the Lunar Module during landing burn ? PLEASE . ) They could n't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts , all of which is in the public domain ; instead they wrote their own dialogue , which sounds like crap.<br /><br />But we liked the maggots.<br /><br />So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots . Uh , yay . 1.5/5 .
0 While the 3-D animation ( the highlight of the show ) did it 's job well , most other elements fell flat . It was as though the filmmakers thought " well , it 's gon na be 3-D so we do n't have to work that hard on the plot or character development . " And the fact that it 's a children 's movie is absolutely no excuse . The public is drawn to three dimensional characters ( Shrek , Nemo 's Dad ) just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics . The only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional Scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight.<br /><br />And the absolute kicker ? Buzz Aldrin 's appearance at the very end ( after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half ) comes on the screen and ruins everyone 's good time by calling the film 's main characters " contaminants " and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility.<br /><br / > ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ? ? Did you just wanna tell the kids the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do n't exist while you 're at it ?
0 When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised . In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was showing at a 4-D attraction ( you know , the attraction that the seats move ) . I take it that the version I saw was a shortened version ( 15 min . ) and also re - created to add the motion effects . It was a cute movie ... but that was it . It was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... trite . I was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk . I will say , the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute . So all - in - all , I would say , if you want to bring the younger kids ... go for it . But if you are wanting to take your older kids , take them to another movie ... they will thank you .
0 1st the good news . The 3-D is spectacularly well done , and they do n't go for the gotcha gimmicks . The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history , and even features one of the actual participants in that story : Buzz Aldrin.<br /><br />And now the meat of the matter : It 's about FLIES , for krissakes ! Flies with big , googy human eyes , true , but flies nonetheless . Remember when I likened the " Underworld " movies to rats vs. cockroaches ? That was n't intended as praise , and I never dreamed anyone would take it literally . This one 's got even less empathy going for it . Baby maggots ? Ugh . In one of those odd confluences of Hollywood groupthink , this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as " Space Chimps " , also about critters in space.<br /><br />Go rent " Apollo 13 " and see a 9-rated movie about the REAL space program ( RIP ) .
0 This is not a good movie . Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par . The 3D was OK , but not superb . I almost fell asleep in this movie.<br /><br />The story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it . The characters are lacking , I truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested . Pixar this is not.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more special 3D effects . Also I wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying " Lord of the flies " Pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting .
0 " Nat " ( voiced by Trevor Gagnon ) , along with his brainiac friend " IQ " ( voiced by Philip Bolden ) and the always hungry " Scooter " ( David Gore ) are kids with big dreams . They want to be the first flies in space . And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon , the Apollo 11 , is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is the animation of the film . I found it done very well done . The scenery had depth to it , as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes . I did n't see the movie in 3-D , as it was broadcast on HBO . However , I could see that there really was n't any scenes which took advantage of the 3-D effects except a fight between characters near the end . I also was n't really impressed with the design of the characters . To me , they did n't look like anything resembling a fly , especially in the coloring . The flies were an unusual blue - gray that was kind of distracting to me.<br /><br />The performances from the cast was not bad , but it was n't good either . There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story . The writing was certainly written for a younger audience , with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh . I saw nothing for adults , like jokes that they 'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning.<br /><br />History was not followed in this film . In fact , I think it was completely ignored , as the main focus was the flies . I also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction , and no flies were on Apollo 11 . I did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though.<br /><br />If you are an adult , this is not for you . It was not made for the entire family . This is certainly just for kids . But , save this one for a rainy day .
0 I , also having endured hundreds of children 's movies in the past , consider this to be one of the worst I have ever seen.<br /><br />1 ) I resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that Russia is not " the bad guys " . Also , that mocking Russian names like " Poopchev " is inappropriate.<br /><br />2 ) The grandfather fly 's birthday party scene contained a quasi - sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone . Two other flies also needlessly use the word " crap " twice.<br /><br />3 ) The whole movie largely smacks of 1950 's stereotypes and propaganda that I thought we , as a nation , were proud to have risen above.<br /><br />In all it 's just crude , badly animated , even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view .
0 Today , I visited an Athenean Cinema with my two kids ( 6 & 8 years old ) , payed 3 x 12 euros ( about 45 US $ total ) not to mention gas , popcorn & soda , was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was " forced " to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick " cold war like " propaganda movie , like none I have seen during the last 20 years ... AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN ... IN HEAVEN 'S NAME ! < br /><br />PS 1 : The average working Greek makes no more than 850 Euros a month ( approxiamtely 1050 US $ ) < br /><br />PS 2 My kids liked it ... but then again they are no more than babies > in Greek : mora , morons > like the one who wrote the script & the others who made this " 3d disgrace " happen.<br /><br />PS 3 3D animation is fantastic but who gives a .... !
0 this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old ( manic American ) to write a story of a moon trip . Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept . but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while . Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead < br /><br />Damn . Not enough lines , yet I feel that sums it up ... well , I agree with an above review - this is like a cold - war propaganda story . Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing , or if the flies had died in the first minute . BTW - why were all the main character flies deformed ? - not one had the full compliment of limbs !
0 With the MASSIVE advertising this is getting on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that ilk , my son was bugging us to see it . Between DVD and the theaters , I 've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding ( Incredibles , Shrek ) to the really bad ( Wall - E , Brother Bear ) . But this was easily the worst movie I 've ever seen , kids or no kids . It was a " when it this stupid thing going to end ? " kind of experience ? OK , it 's aimed at toddlers ( or it better be - it 's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 ) , but I 've never seen something so predictable , repetitive , and slow - moving . Then once you 're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over , there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke , but there is n't one - it 's serious , though it 's hard to tell what they 're trying to accomplish . The 3-D effects ... yeah , if you 've never seen a Viewmaster they 're a big deal , otherwise no ( if you look at the screen without glasses , it appears to be the same process ) . Even my son was bored by the end . Both my wife and I looked at each other and said " wow " at the end . Bad in every respect .
0 As long as there 's been 3d technology , ( 1950 's I think ) there 's been animation made for it . I remember specifically , a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it . I do n't remember the name at the moment , but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus , was feeding an elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts . This was made to watch in 3d probably 1960 's . If you happened to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3d in theaters , they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it 's origin . There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses . This claim was a bad move because it 's not difficult to prove them wrong . On top of that , this just looks like a bad movie .
0 Actually , this is a lie , Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3d animated movie . I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago . Did n't Bug 's Life also do that ? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree , so I 'm saying before they go and use that as there logo . Also , Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios . They should still consider it as a movie , because it appeared in a " theater " and you could buy it for DVD . The movie was cute , at least the little flyes were . I liked IQ . I agree with animaster , they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out - and - back adventure . I recommend it to families and kids .
0 Six GIs , about to be send home and discharged , get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia . Surrounded by hooded figures , two male dancers pretend to have a fight . Behind them , on an altar , a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake , finally biting one of the dancers on the neck . The imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights . ( This is definitely a female imitation snake . ) The cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and , most definitely , no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed . Naturally , the GIs take a flash photo , send the cult members into an angry hysteria , steal the basket containing the " snake " and run off with it into the Asian night.<br /><br />One of the guys , the most offensive and snarky , dies from a cobra bite on the neck , though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room.<br /><br />Back in New York , it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives , still maintaining their bond with one another . Their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley ( David Janssen ) to graduate research student ( Richard Long ) . James Dobson , Jack Kelly , and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood . Richard Long has a nice blond girl friend . Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer . But they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy.<br /><br />Then a dark , shifty - looking , mysterious woman ( Faith Domergue ) shows up and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group.<br /><br />Guess what happens . First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash . Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue . Something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk . Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths . They also reckon that maybe she 's turning into a cobra , which is the case . Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point.<br /><br />By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled , particularly Thompson , who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him , too , although he must explain to her what " love " is . No matter . A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Long 's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and Thompson must throw the snake out the window . On the pavement below , the body changes to that of Domergue . The end.<br /><br />I think I 'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises . I 'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing . Who paid for Domergue 's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York ? Who 's paying her utility bills in the hotel ? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe ? How come she speaks American English so well ? What the hell 's going on ? The writers and director have clearly seen some of Val Lewton 's modest horror films and , though not much effort has gone into this production , they 've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton . In Lewton 's " The Cat People " , for instance , the woman is transformed into a black leopard but , with one tiny exception , the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it . Most of the transformations here use shadows too , but unlike Lewton 's , the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous.<br /><br />Lewton also made occasional use of what he called " buses " . Lewton 's first " bus " was a literal one . A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps . Something or someone is following her . She freezes with fright under a street lamp . Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her . She looks upward . There is a loud , wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end . It 's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her . The producers used at least two " buses " in this film and they amount to nothing . A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection , for instance , and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him . There is no set up to the shot . It 's jammed in with a shoe horn.<br /><br />I do n't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy , ugly , venomous , and phallic . As a matter of fact , no snakes are slimy , most are harmless , and many are extraordinarily beautiful . Furthermore , they 're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals . You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity ? Try a six - lined racerunner . It 's a really fast lizard . When it sees something to eat , it rushes up and gobbles it down.<br /><br />Anyway , if you want to see some fine , low - budget scary films , do n't bother with this one . Find " The Cat People " or one of Lewton 's other minor masterpieces , of which this is an obvious copy .
0 Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie . Unfortunately , that is not saying much.<br /><br />It has a competent cast of second - rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances . It is efficiently directed , entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot . It looks OK , but is ponderously over - plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded.<br /><br />For example , the double cobra attack on the first of the GIs was surely one attack too many.<br /><br />The business about Julia choosing to marry Pete rather than Tom never amounts to anything . Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia ( nor is she).<br /><br />Julia 's ' feminine intuition ' is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development , but it does n't . Similarly , Pete 's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on Tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time.<br /><br />These are just symptoms of the underlying problem . The movie is structured like a mystery but it is n't . As soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading , so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know.<br /><br />The ending is particularly lame . Julia is menaced purely by accident . Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . When Tom turns up in the nick of time to save her , it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all . He then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done.<br /><br />It is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that I found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads . Then it occurred to me . Someone said : " Those Val Lewton movies were very successful over at RKO , so why do n't we make one like that?" < br /><br />Cult of the Cobra is clearly modelled on Cat People : mysterious , troubled , shape - shifting woman falls in love with the hero , is apparently frigid , kills people , arouses the suspicions of the hero 's woman friend and dies at the end . But ' modelled on ' does n't mean ' as good as ' - by a wide margin . It copies , but does n't understand what it is copying.<br /><br />It is obviously trying for the low - key , suggestive Lewton style , but this approach does n't follow through into the story . Lisa is no Irene . She is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her . We get a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia , so immediately recognise her when she turns up in New York . There is never any doubt about her purpose . Neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake.<br /><br />Then again , during her nocturnal prowling we get , not one , but two attempts at ' buses ' . Neither come off , because the director does n't understand what makes a ' bus ' work and , in any case , they happen to the stalker , not the person being stalked.<br /><br />These faint echoes of Cat People give Cult of the Cobra whatever small distinction it might have , but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation.<br /><br />Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery , but I doubt if Lewton or Tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time - passer came out .
0 Faith Domergue ( better known as " Dr. Ruth " in THIS ISLAND EARTH ) is the only reason to watch this film . The story is very thin , and once the Air Force buddies return to the States with a Cobra Curse upon them the action is just a waiting game . See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend the rest is n't happening .
0 I mean the word " pedestrian " . Seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen . Faith Domergue can do better than this . She is supposed to be the mysterious , vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson ( there 's an idea , eh ? ) . Instead she 's a common would - be housewife of the fifties , and the single , flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before Faith had her coffee . As for the rest of the cast , they are all so earnestly " all - American " that the result is laughable . This is ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in " The Cat People " . I think " Cult of the Cobra " should really be titled " Cult of the Contractual Obligation " . Why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow - moving , predictable , derivative failure like this ?
0 I was very unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2 , but this is possibly worse than both titles . First of all , I did n't like the animation , very Saturday - morning - cartoon , only worse in some scenes . I liked some of the characters , namely Thunderbolt and Patch , but the other characters , like Cruella were mediocre . Cruella was truly villainous in the original , but she lost her quality in the sequel . What she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly . Also her artist companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you , and Roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight . The voice talents were very good though especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt , with the exception of Jodi Benson , the accent ruined it for me . There were some good moments , but the whole plot seemed bloated for me , and highly suggestive of an extended TV episode . All in all , a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s Disney movies along with Jungle Book . Sorry , I can only give this a 3/10 , it just was n't my cup of tea . Bethany Cox
0 1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10(Dir - Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith ) : Drab and un - spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated ` 101 Dalmatians . ' Yes , the movie continues where it ended in the first one , but the problem is that it plays out much like the original . One of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story , which this one does n't have . The animation is also very un - spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again . When is Disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re - do 's etc .. etc . Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out .
0 I should explain why i gave this ... "piece of art " 1 star rating out of possible 10 . Simply because it 's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased . probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have followed.<br /><br />I am not fond of these pointless gore movies like HOSTEL or so - i think that 's disgusting and pretty terrible ( in all the possible contextual meanings ) , but as i found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called " historical drama " - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10 as it has plenty of it and Tarantino would have been more than happier with it ( and made Kill Bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible ) . but the thing about " historical drama " genre is that it 's a sub - category of the " trash movies " where John Romero is the undead - gory - emperor - of - the - guts and so automatically it ca n't be rated as your default movie - as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you ca n't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so , or it was simply bad . it 's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting , bad screenplay and bad everything else . And by some turn of faith - i am one of them too . there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go - the day is saved ! but that 's definitely an opinion of mine and does n't have match with anyones ' else.<br /><br />What i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie - then Fellini 's Casanova is definitely the choice , but heed my advice and do n't rate it by default means .
0 In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life . The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small , and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings . That said , " Casanova " left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that can not be summed up more adequately by Bukowski : < br /><br />"Casanova died too , just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all . to say that he lived well is true ; to say I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true . the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find ; that is why the human race stands where it does today : we have bred the clever and lasting Casanovas , all hollow inside , like the Easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children . " < br /><br />As far as I could make it out , this is the position Fellini takes regarding his subject ; granted , with more empathy , but disgusted nonetheless.<br /><br />Casanova 's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior , themes Fellini dealt with more pointedly in " Satyricon " . The succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn , just without the coherence ; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction.<br /><br />Yet , there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool . And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious ; Fellini could n't . More than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro , for sure , but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else . I find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film . It was a story not worth telling .
0 This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini . About the only one more bizarre is his SATYRICON . This is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence , opulence and sexual challenge . Sutherland makes a curiously unappealing Casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover 's autobiography fail to engage the viewer . The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING . The Academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter . Also nominated ( oddly ) was the disjointed , pointless and almost inacessible screenplay . Go figure ! ! The film on video is only 150 minutes , 16 minutes short of the original running time . This viewer was grateful .
0 There are two groups of people ... those who love every Fellini movie they see and normal people . While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films , I can also honestly say that I ca n't stand some of them . My opinion , by the way , is not just some knee - jerk reaction -- I have seen most of Fellini 's films and have also seen many films by the world 's most famous directors . With this in mind , I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini . They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the " intelligensia " , while the average person would never sit through some of their films . Heck , even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films . So , since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses , it 's not surprising that their films are so often praised -- it 's like a cult ! If you do n't believe me , think about many of Godard 's films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE, ... or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS ? These films abound with boredom , weirdness and incomprehensibility . Now I am NOT saying a film ca n't be weird ( after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER ) , but it must be watchable!<br /><br />Now on to this movie . Somehow , Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy . This is no small task -- it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable . Instead of cheap sexual thrills , the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul . I know some of this must have been Fellini 's intention , but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance -- especially since Sutherland 's lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself ! Unfortunately , when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades , there really is n't anything else to watch.<br /><br />An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellini 's wife , Giulietta Masina . Considering that in addition to this , that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman , it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen . I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well . This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting . Do n't say I did n't warn you !
0 Things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by Spike Lee.<br /><br />Bleek Gilliam ( Denzell Washington ) is a happenin ' jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at Below the Underdog . His problems include an incompetent manager , a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he 's playing musical mattress with . The real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music . The band 's manager , Giant , has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but Bleek remains loyal for as long as possible . It will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man.<br /><br />As Bleek , Denzell Washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm . He 's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art , dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness . He simply lacks the fire . Wesley Snipes who plays Henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of Lee 's torpid dialogue . As Giant , Lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction . Loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic Ratso Rizzo to Bleek 's Joe Buck he adopts a limp and even the " I 'm walkin ' here " moment from Midnight Cowboy . In this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it.<br /><br />Lee 's script is all tepid argument , heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that Lee has to inject to remain down . The scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the Bleek , Giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles . Completing this travesty is Lee 's pretentious visual style . Tracking shots , zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes . They just wander.<br /><br />Blues is Lee 's love letter to jazz ( made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets ) and it 's all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve . Jazz on film is better served by Tavernier 's " Round Midnight " and Eastwood 's " Bird " which get below the surface , reveal more sides of the form , the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by Forrest Whitaker and the real deal Dexter Gordon . This Spike Lee Joint does n't even offer a mild buzz . It 's some pretty bad homegrown .
0 I am normally a Spike Lee fan . It takes some time to really get into his " mojo " , but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart , Lee is a genius . Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled ( two of my favorite films of his ) , there was no clear story in this film . I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others , but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out . Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him , but you could tell that this was not Lee 's favorite film . Not only did Lee direct this film , but he also wrote it . You could tell . The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film . This film was coming full circle and it was n't going to be pretty . Lee was not 100 % behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing . Of all the films I have seen Lee direct , this was the brightest and more modest of his films . It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own . I do n't know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it , or what   but this film did not demonstrate his true talent.<br /><br />For anyone out there that has seen this film , and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film , I suggest you give him a second chance . Do n't get me wrong , I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you , but Lee does grow up . His work becomes more of his own , and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films . It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour , but when I did , it was sheer brilliance . Perhaps it was the actors , perhaps the story , but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man 's journey into the unknown . I guess that is what I was hoping Mo ' Better Blues would turn out to be . This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up , but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel . He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation , and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema , but this was not the film to showcase his talent.<br /><br />Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike 's sister playing one of the love interests . I do n't know about you , and your family , but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister . I do n't care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid , I would never do it . It is just something that I never wish to see , but apparently that is different for Spike . He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse . It was sad and it even made me blush . Also , I need somebody to answer me this . What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film ? So , I am sitting there on my couch , ready to start the film , when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film , then he acknowledges himself . That did not build for a strong remaining of the story . Again , I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent . Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions.<br /><br />There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end . Do n't get me wrong , this was a very bad movie , but there is always a diamond in every alleyway . The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing . He continually went back and forth , weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera . It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes . The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film . By keeping the same pacing and direction , he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life . Other than these two moments , the rest of the film was pure rubbish , not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind.<br /><br />Grade : * * out of * * * * *
0 An allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes , including improper use of a broom , are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high - school jocks in Glen Ridge , New Jersey , by a " mildly retarded " student ( Heather Matarazzo ) . The investigation and building of the case are handed over to the DA 's office , where Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz are put in charge.<br /><br />Rumors about the case spread through Glen Ridge , an upper - middle - class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community . ( One of their fathers is a police lieutenant . ) Nobody believes Matarazzo . " Our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement , rape her , and subject her to such sexual humiliation . " The question is whether Sheedy and Stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial . Matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff . She 's desperate for love and friendship , and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements . A slimy reporter says , " You can trust me , " but it turns out the reporter ca n't be trusted at all . Another student , a very popular girl in school , pulls a Linda Tripp on Matarazzo , pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results ! As a consequence , watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster . At first it looks like a good case for Sheedy and Stoltz . But then , oops , the community organizes against the law . Then it looks good again . But then the reporter interferes . Then that obstacle is no sooner overcome , than Linda Tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate Matarazzo was lying . ( Well , actually , she WAS lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her . ) Then that 's overcome , but Matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she does n't want to be characterized as " retarded . " Eric Stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor . I say that for the simple reason that he and I lived in Pago Pago around the same time . ( I hope he was n't the kid I had that altercation with at the bar of the Seaside Club . If he was , I take back my compliment . ) Ally Sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize . She did a marvelous self - restrained job in " Fine Art " but I did n't sense any particular effort being put into this role , which was rather formulaic anyway . I mean , neither she nor Stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what 's essentially a comic book story.<br /><br />The producers and director had the good sense to choose Heather Matarazzo for the role of victim . The very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely , neotenous blond . Instead , Matarazzo , without being at all ugly , looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up . Nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle . She has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to , which is all for the good.<br /><br />Matarazzo 's character is the best drawn in the film . The jocks are stereotypes . Pure evil . They think themselves above the law , barge in on some nice girl 's party in East Orange , trash the place during a party far worse than " La Dolce Vita 's " climactic orgy , and leave without explanation or apology . They deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do.<br /><br />I referred to this as a comic book story and that 's pretty much what it is . It challenges none of our prejudices . It reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into Good and Evil . And we do n't have a moment 's doubt about who 's who . What I 'm waiting for -- not really , that 's just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others , but in which the victim is LYING in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right - thinking folk like the rest of us.<br /><br />The film is based on a true story , as are so many others we 've all seen , and even more fictional features . ( Eg . , " The Accused " . ) Some are good , some are strictly routine . Okay . Fair enough . Now when do we get to see a film about the Tawana Brawley case , in which the teen - aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days , then had her friends strip her , tie her up , and smear her with dirt , so she could claim she 'd been abducted and raped by the police ? Now THAT would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not .
0 I recently watched Belle Epoque , thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film . I was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film . Maybe the conflict I had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now , the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times . Aside from predictability of the plot , some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ( ex . a certain event at the wedding ) . At times the film was a bit preachy in it 's ideas and in relation to the Franco era the film was set in and the Church . The only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments , the scenery , and the character of Violeta being a strong , independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics .
0 Here 's yet another blasphemous European story in which they blast the religion of their country . ( These atheist filmmakers are relentless . ) Here we see a brutal blasting of Catholics and/or the Catholic clergy ( and I am not Catholic).<br /><br />This won actually won an Academy Award for bes foreign film . That 's probably because the story made Catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak . One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else . He 's portrayed as nothing but an idiot . No wonder the secular- dominated Academy loved this movie.<br /><br />Also , there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story . The daughters take turns seducing the " seminary " student ( who states he studied for six years but says he 's an agnostic ! ) . I mean , how blasphemous IS this film??!!!<br /><br />This is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular - progressive bigotry of the film business , worldwide ( not just Hollywood ) .
0 This movie is just crap . Even though the directors claim to be part of that oi - culture , it 's still a very , very bad directorial debut . The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact , that they are all amateurs and never acted before , but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing . There 's no timing at all in that movie . I felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie ( it 's their first feature ) , that they actually never really asked themselves , what story they wanna tell . I met Ben ( one of the directors ) on several occasions and he 's a nice and thoughtful guy , but that does n't make him a director . I think , that " American History X " is full of clichés , but somehow manages to transport a story . " Oi!Warning " is full of clichés , does n't tell anything new or provocative and ( -that 's the sad thing about this movie ) it 's far from any Oi!-Reality.<br /><br />If you wanna see weird but great German films , watch the movies of Michael Haneke , Christoph Schlingensief , Oskar Roehler , Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel:<br /><br />Benny 's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... < br /><br / > * * * out of ten , because of the topic and the photography
0 As big as a Texas prairie and equally as boring . Even Liz Taylor , James Dean , Chill Wills , and Dennis Hopper ca n't float this overbloated boat . Taylor actually LOOKS bad -- wrong wardrobe , wrong hair , and wrong makeup -- a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career . Hopper gives the only believable performance , and Dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually do n't remember him for -- a comic actor . Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a , say , Redford could have done with the male lead . There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes , just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other . Except for Hopper , there is no character development , only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery . To its credit , the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects , and it does have SIZE , making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests . Those with the DVD version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk . You wo n't be missing anything of interest .
0 With all due disrespect for this George Stevens Sr . " epic " of miscastings and misreadings , I can only wonder that the James Dean " legend " could survive this outing , I submit that then - studio obeisances to bankable box office " giants " came a cropper of its own ' gigantismoses ' . Nor were Rock and Liz that much better off . Let us just say that the televised " Dallas " was the authentic " heir , " even if contemp(tuous ) latterday " Texans " like Lay and DELay , not to mention our putative " president " of these here Yewbenighted States of Amurrika , perform a one - upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions . I never read Edna Ferber 's original , but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein . And all those well - paid , I would imagine , " supporting " actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding , " Giant " is , to me at least , a midget of scant merit , never mind the promo campaigns .
0 " Giant " is one of the most boring , overly - long Hollywood contraptions ever . Many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy . Rock Hudson , Elizabeth Taylor , and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production . A central notion to this movie , that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land , is absurd , and I know this because I 'm from Houston . A couple of scenes , especially Dean serving Taylor coffee , redeem this otherwise boring film . For a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in Texas , see " Hud " ( one of Paul Newman 's great performances ) or " The Last Picture Show . "
0 Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying , untalented self in this film . This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy . Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better . James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie . The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long . The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make - up . Hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age.<br /><br />0/10 .
0 Every once in a while I will rent an action / adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important . This is why I own a copy of Charlie 's Angels ( 2000 ) - not a quality film , but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while . One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and a few Monty Python movies for much the same reason.<br /><br />In any case , I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged . For the most part , I got what I wanted . The plot was something along the lines of a poorly written Xena episode , and the Kathy Long 's acting was very community theater ( not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress ) . There were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs . Somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately , most of them die pretty darned quick.<br /><br />Like most martial arts films , the further you get into the movie , the more emphasis there is on action , and the plot ( which was n't strong to begin with ) deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting . However , the more Kathy Long fights , the more time the director devotes to her backside . By the end of the movie I was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times Kathy Long 's tight red shorts were center screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately , there just was n't enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time . If you are a hard core Xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours - by all means , go to the grocery store and spend the .50 cents on the rental . There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie.<br /><br />Just do n't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours.<br /><br />Unless , of course , you happen to like Kathy Long 's derrière . THEN you might want to purchase a copy .
0 Set in a post - apocalyptic environment , cyborgs led by warlord Job rein over the human population . They basically keep them as livestock , as they need fresh human blood to live off . Nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid , and years have past when she came face - to - face with the cyborgs again , but this time she 's saved by the cyborg Gabriel , who was created to destroy all cyborgs . Job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city , while Nea ( with revenge on mind ) pleads Gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and she 'll get him to Gabriel.<br /><br />Cheap low - rent cyborg / post - apocalyptic foray by writer / director Albert Pyun ( who made " Cyborg " prior to it and the blistering " Nemsis " the same year ) is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties . Very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story , as the turgid script is weak , corny and overstated . The leaden banter tries to be witty , but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments . Most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine . The material could 've used another polish up , as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions , lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone . The open - ended , cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt , especially since a sequel has yet to be made . Makes it feel like that that run out of money , and said " Time to pack up . Let 's finish it off another day ( or maybe in another decade ) . There 's no rush . " However it did find it rather diverting , thanks largely to its quick pace , some well - executed combat and George Mooradian 's gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop . Performances are fair . Kris Kristofferson 's dry and steely persona works perfectly as Gabriel and a self - assured , psychically capable Kathy Long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression . However her acting is too wooden . A mugging Lance Henriksen gives a mouth - watering performance of pure ham , as the villainous cyborg leader Job who constantly having a saliva meltdown . Scott Paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and Gary Daniels pouts about as one too . Pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces , involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow - motion . Seeping into the background is a scorching , but mechanical sounding music score . The special effects and make - up FX stand up fine enough . Watchable , but not quite a success and it 's minimal limitations can be a cause of that .
0 This is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and it 's the bad one . Apparently all his energy went into " Nemesis " which was an entertaining non - stop action movie , and had a much more expensive look . " Knights " is clunky and cheesy , a bottom - of - the - barrel sci - fi that too often resembles a video game ( new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible ) . The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long ; not a particularly attractive woman , but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine . As for Kris Kristofferson , considering his age at the time ( 58 ) , I hope his stunt double was well paid . ( * 1/2 )
0 In the ravaged wasteland of the future , mankind is terrorized by Cyborgsrobots with human featuresthat have discovered a new source of fuel : human blood . Commanded by their vicious leader Jōb ( Lance Henriksen ) , the Cyborgs prepare to overtake Taos , a densely populated human outpost.<br /><br />Only one force can stop Jōb 's death marchthe Cyborg Gabriel ( Kris Kristofferson ) , who is programmed to destroy Jōb and his army.<br /><br />In the ruins of a ransacked village , Gabriel finds Nea ( Kathy Long ) , a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by Cyborgs ten years earlier . Now she wants revenge . They strike a pact : Gabriel will train Nea how to fight the Cyborgs and Nea will lead Gabriel to Taos.<br /><br />Five - time kick - boxing champion Kathy Long has all the right moves in this high - speed adventure that delivers plenty of action . Also stars Gary Daniels ( as David ) and Scott Paulin ( as Simon ) .
0 I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran , so I did n't know who had done it at first . The longer I saw it , the more I started thinking , " Jesus , this looks like an Albert Pyun flick . " Was n't quite sure , though , for two main reasons : the photography was quite good ( and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful ) , and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon , a murderous cyborg , but with some style and a sense of humor . Paulin must have ad - libbed the many clever one - liners he shot out , because Albert Pyun has n't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career . Unfortunately , Paulin does n't have all that much screen time before he 's gone , and the movie 's the worse for it . Lance Henriksen , playing the evil head cyborg , growls his way through his part , as he 's done in countless other movies like this . I do n't know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing ; maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it . He goes through the movie looking ( and sounding ) like he just woke up , and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent . Kathy Long , the nominal hero , has a great body , is attractive , has a great body , fights extremely well , has a great body , and does n't have an iota of acting talent , but that does n't matter in a movie like this . This being an Albert Pyun film , it 's full of the trademarks that we 've all come to know and love : inane and idiotic dialog , choppy editing , and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured , " Ah , nobody'll ever notice." < br /><br />As bad as this movie is , however , it 's a shade above most of Pyun 's other efforts -- this is " Citizen Kane " compared to his brain - numbing " Adrenaline : Feel the Rush " , for example . The fights are pretty well done , if repetitive ( after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other , you find yourself saying , " Alright already , go to something else " ) , and Long is very athletic ( and , as a previous poster has noted , has a great derrière ) . It 's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination , but it 's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as Pyun 's usual extravaganzas . You could do worse than rent this movie -- not much worse , granted , but worse nonetheless .
0 This movie will promote the improvement of the mind . Read a book ! It 's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make . I 've seen " B " movies before but the " C " movie has just been invented . I did n't think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching but I found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into " Knights . " High school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume . Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind . My roommate , who loves these types of movies even turned it off . Now that has to really tell you something . If you watch this movie , and like it , I will pray for you .
0 There is a word for this sort of film , and that word is " drivel . " It was drivel when it was a VHS rental , and it 's drivel on satellite re - runs now.<br /><br />It might fool you , because it has 2 moderately well - known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen , reasonable soundtrack music , and nice Monument Valley scenery.<br /><br />It also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot.<br /><br />If that 's all you want from a movie , then maybe this will keep you happy.<br /><br />It 's still drivel , though .
0 You ca n't really go far when the initial story is n't all that great . The premise of cyborg 's needing blood is just dopey.<br /><br />The script is blasé ' . The actors do n't have much to work with . The sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs . It 's a trademark that if the background is the desert , then the movie has no budget.<br /><br />Lack of budget is okay , if there 's a story . " Solarbabies " and " Blood of Champions " are examples of decent work from no $ . but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich . Again , forgivable if only the story did n't just plain suck.<br /><br />Finally , this movie commits the biggest crime of all : It does n't finish ! It simply ends as if it 's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie . But the rest never comes . Just odd.<br /><br />Just bad .
0 someone needed to make a car payment ... this is truly awful ... makes jean Claude 's cyborg look like gone with the wind ... this is an hour I wish I could sue to get back ... luckily it produced severe somnolence ... from which I fell asleep . how can actors of this caliber create this dog ? I would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre . I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table . $ 5.99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie ... if you really have to have it , wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell.<br /><br />please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity .
0 Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel , however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android ( Kris Kristofferson ) and a warrior woman ( Kathly Long ) as they face off against Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels ( Who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie ) Of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie , the most poignant is Who 's idea was it to cast country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets . No , do n't get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg . Strangely one suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren , however Lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it . However despite the disastrous casting , Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie . He gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive Kathy Long . ( And Kristofferson is playing a robot ) despite the miscasting , Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest . Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasted but basically Knights is baffling failure . You stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper . ( This is a movie where a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack ) Worst of all it ends in a what if sequel , thankfully this has yet to materialize although I still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event.<br /><br / > * out of 4-(Bad )
0 Once in a while you get amazed over how BAD a film can be , and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap . There is absolutely No talent included in this film - from a crappy script , to a crappy story to crappy acting . Amazing ...
0 This move is about as bad as they come . I was , however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery . There are many great shots of the southwest including many in Monument Valley , one of the most breathtaking places in the US . It is also , starting with John Ford , one of the most filmed . In fact one scene with Kris and the girl was filmed on a place called John Ford point .
0 Knights was just a beginning of a series , a pilot , one might say . The plot ( I really should n't call it that , there was n't any plot ) was n't logical at all and there were many mistakes , like [ warning , I 'm summarizing the plot]:<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs ( the bad guys ) but after the climax , Nea found out that there were many many more left of them . And it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill , but after a month 's training , Nea could kill them with a single blow.<br /><br />The movie was just pure kicking . I was n't surprised at all , when I found out that the leading star was a kick boxer.<br /><br />There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie : it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends . I recommend watching it , if you are in need of laughter .
0 Still a sucker for Pyun 's esthetic sense , I liked this movie , though the " unfinished " ending was a let - down . As usual , Pyun develops a warped sense of humour and Kathy Long 's fights are extremely impressive . Beautifully photographed , this has the feel it was done for the big screen .
0 This movie is probably the worst I have seen . Bad acting , bad script , bad everything . Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting . Both Cyborg ( Van Damme , 1989 ) and Nemesis ( Olivier Gruner , 1993 ) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it 's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well!<br /><br />The story is not original . The world has become a terrible place , possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war , and people live under medieval circumstances . A special breed of robots ( cyborgs ) live on human blood and there 's the story ... The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there " prophecy " and the humans need someone to stop them . One girl together with a robot ( Kris Kristofferson ) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.<br /><br />In this movie the director tries some Hong - Kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far . The movie fails miserably in this attempt.<br /><br />I recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new " worst ever " movie to relate to . And to fans of the genre I recommend " Cyborg " since I think it 's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor . And if you ca n't stand Van Damme then check out " Nemesis".<br /><br />I rated this movie 1/10 .
0 and it does n't help rohmer 's case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject ( with a little help from Wagner).<br /><br />maybe this movie did n't look so paltry when it came out , without the syberberg film to compare it to , which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources . I actually ca n't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film . all I know is , the German version is pure magic , while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes.<br /><br />the music ... la musique ... is n't even credited here on IMDb ... but someone based it on ' airs from the 12th-14th centuries " or something ... well it is n't a great help to the film . it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy , comme le frommage mon cher!!!<br /><br />rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive , too , and that does n't help matters . syberberg 's Parsifal was adorable , and can be seen on German television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented . .. .<br /><br />I shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like . I remember that the last time I saw the film in a theater , the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty . But even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer , I 'm afraid.<br /><br />points for earnestness , for chutzpah , but ... this film simply needed beau - coup more bucks . it does n't look like a medieval manuscript it looks CHEAPO ! BON MARCHE ! ! oh and yeah , it just ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected ... blah !
0 This movie deserves credit for its original approach . It combines elements of theater , film , and epic storytelling . Unfortunately , it falls flat on all levels . The films biggest weakness is it 's unwillingness to commit to anything ; it has camp , moralistic , and epic elements without ever committing to any of them . As for the story itself , Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable , unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.<br /><br />Most likely two types of people will see this , francophiles or Arthuriophiles . Speaking as one of the latter , I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby , disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story .
0 I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci - Fi fandom days of the ' 60s , I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors / actresses , most notably Ben , actress Fay Spain , and Jody Fair , who played Angela in 1961 's The Young Savages . Ben was one of the people at a low - key Sci - Fi con in Chicago , about 1970 , when I had a nice chat with him and his " career " and life . All these were published in some now - long - forgotten fanzine of the day . Wish I still had copies of those interviews , but time marches on , and any of those people surely would n't ' remember me at all so many years later . Ben was a really nice fellow , ekeing out a living ( The cons of those days did n't even pay their guest , unless , of course they were big - name stars , and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars , at most ! Good to know Ben 's still alive & kicking ! How 'bout a remake of Creature , but 50 years older ! Ugly then , uglier now !
0 First of all , yes , animals have emotions . If you did n't know that already , then I believe you are a moron . But let 's assume that none of us are morons . We all know that animals have emotions , and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature , correct?<br /><br />What we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are " human " . The filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human - like behaviour , and when it happens they say , " That monkey is almost human ! " ( that 's actually a direct quote).<br /><br />Everything is in human terms . They waste time theorizing about what makes dogs " smile " , but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means . The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting . They even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat.<br /><br />I had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms . I wanted to learn how animals emote in their OWN languages . But instead , researchers keep falling back on pedantic , anthropomorphic observations and assumptions . Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps " celebrating Christmas " , and this was enough to turn my stomach.<br /><br />But it does n't end there . Half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities . All the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars , and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages . One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning ( though you have to be quick to notice it ) where a captive monkey says in sign language , " Want out . Hurry go." < br /><br />Obscure references are made to " stress tests " and psychological experiments which I shudder to imagine . Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a " mother figure " . And after 40 years of experiments , the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion : monkeys have emotions.<br /><br />One chimp named " Washoe " has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose , and to this day she remains thus . We get a brief glimpse ( again through bars ) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression . Personally , I do n't need to see any further experimental data . Washoe , I apologize for our entire species .
0 Bad plot ( though good for a B - movie ) , good fast - paced fight scenes , at most a 5 out of 10 . But something has always bothered me about this film : how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks ? In the TV version , she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman , even a kiss in a garden . Yet in the regular ( video ) version , most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all . This bothers me because it not only takes out a female ( though cliched ) point - of - view to the film , it also makes the final shot seem creepy . This film would have been better had they kept her scenes in , because in those scenes at least she has a personality , one that undercuts whatever Speakman says .
0 < br /><br />Get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick . Speakman 's considerable kempo skill ( nice spin kicks , decent with the sticks - poor couch ! ) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting . The plot is n't half bad ; just executed pretty poorly . But if you 're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts , you 're missing the boat entirely . And for a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown , way way too few Korean actors ( even extras ) .
0 The Perfectly Stupid Weapon . I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal 's movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie . The plot is predictable , the fights were fair and Jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene .
0 Back ( again ) in Scotland , Lassie is ( again ) on trial for her life . Because the faithful dog sleeps on her master 's grave , she must be put to death , according to law . Oddly , it is also explained that Lassie had no " legal " owner , which is , apparently , also against an old Scottish law . If , after three days , no owner is located , dogs must be destroyed . Edmund Gwenn ( as John Traill ) pleads Lassie 's case , which leads to an extended flashback , showing Lassie 's adoption by Donald Crisp ( as John " Jock " Gray).<br /><br />Although it 's based on an interesting , original story ( " Greyfriars Bobby " ) , " Challenge to Lassie " revisits several earlier Lassie situations ; and , it does not improve upon them . Comparatively speaking , this one is sloppy and unexciting ; and , it 's a disappointing follow - up to " The Sun Comes Up " ( 1949 ) * * * * * * * . Geraldine Brooks ( as Susan Brown ) and several of the other performers may be charming , but ca n't elevate this one . Little Jimmy Hawkins ( from " It 's a Wonderful life " ) is among the notable children supporting Lassie ; much later , he will grow up to marry " Dark Shadows " ' bewitching " Angelique " ( Lara Parker ) .
0 This is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate . It looks as if it were shot on a back lot in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died , Idaho , Colorado Territories , and Montana . It fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious ' bad man , ' ' good man . ' The script is horrible ; there is very little direction , and lousy acting . Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife . Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade . In real life , Jack Slade was a very good stage line superintendent . He was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking . When drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in Virginia City , Montana . To insure that he could never terrorize them again , vigilantes lynched Jack Slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately . This is a horrible movie . I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood butches history at will , even to this day .

0 A resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge . A lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition . Universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas . Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr. to star as Kharis , the Mummy.<br /><br />Other players are George Zucco , Wallace Ford , Turhan Bey , Dick Foran and Elyse Knox.<br /><br />How much longer can this madness continue ?
0 Cheap , mediocre sequel to the successful " The Mummy 's Hand " has presumably dead evil Professor Andoheb(George Zucco)preparing his predecessor Mehemet Bey(Turhan Bey)for the quest of revenge overseas to America using mummy Kharis(Lon Chaney , Jr who has no reason being in the disguise .. any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims)in the goal of killing the surviving members of the Banning family whose patriarch Stephen(Dick Foran)and assistant Babe Hanson(Wallace Ford)retrieved the mummified corpse of Princess Ananka from her tomb in Egypt .. Andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient Egyptian custom . Bey and the mummy Kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the High Priest of Karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise . Every Full Moon , Bey will feed Kharis a form of liquid derived of several Tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master 's wishes . Bey commands Kharis to kill Stephen and his sister Jane(Mary Gordon ) , while also biding time for Babe to return so that he will become victim # 3 . Dr. John Banning(John Hubbard)plans to we d Isobel(Elyse Knox ) , but does n't know that Bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with Kharis ' help . John 's life is in danger because of his father .. he 's also the last remaining member of the Banning line . If Bey has Isobel , there 's no chance of any more Bannings being born . The police must find Kharis and the one responsible for his carnage .. Bey.<br /><br />This film is a continuation from HAND set years later as members of that film , Foran , Ford & Zucco all appear in " aging " make - up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as Andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the Bannings . The cornball romance of John and Isobel seems merely in this plot so that Bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up . And , Bey merely sees her frolicking with John on the grass .. the whole " love - at - first - sight " rubbish really did n't wash for me . Plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm .. is any mummy really THAT powerful ? This film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it . There really is n't that much story here and yes , typical of Universal monster pictures , even in America a mob of people will light .. ho hum .. torches going after Kharis . You know how it 'll end .. John and the super - powerful Kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame .
0 Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction . This is the case with " The Mummy 's Tomb." < br /><br />The script is leftover ideas from older , better Universal horror flicks like " Dracula " and " Frankenstein . " The direction is trite and stale . The acting is mediocre . Even Chaney 's Kharis is feeble compared to Tom Tyler 's in " The Mummy 's Hand , " and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from Christy Cabanne 's vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film!<br /><br />Universal realized how bad this movie was , and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as " The Mummy 's Ghost " with a much better script and better director . The result was likely the best film in their four film " Mummy " cycle , although not anywhere near as good as Karl Freund 's 1932 original.<br /><br />Cabanne 's footage raises this film to a 3 . The " new " stuff is a 2 at best . Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they would n't have to appear in dreck like this anymore !
0 1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir - Harold Young ) : The 3rd Universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer 's perspective . The story is similar and the results are ho - hum . This time the story 's location is the U.S. as the Egyptian priest 's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb . This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney(which does n't make much of a difference because he 's really not asked to do much acting for this character ) . The new priest becomes a morgue - keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice . Again , a girl gets in the way , as the priest falls for one of the descendent 's fiancé and wants her , yes--- to be immortal with him(haven't we heard this before ? ) . The plan is , of course , thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches(similar to the Frankenstein monster ) and the burning of the creature ends the story ... how do they get a sequel ? ? I guess you 'll find out with the next one in the series ? ? or not .....
0 The Mummy 's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy 's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.<br /><br />While I absolutely loved " The Mummy " with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep , and quite liked " The Mummy 's Hand " with Tom Tyler as Kharis ( which is the direct prequel to this film ) , I was not as taken with " The Mummy 's Tomb".<br /><br />It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting . Lon Chaney Jr is okay as Kharis , but does n't really stand out . And I guess that 's my main criticism of this movie - that nothing really stands out . There 's nothing really terrible here , but nothing really outstanding either , so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy 's tale .
0 This is a direct sequel to ' The Mummy 's Hand ' ( 1940 ) , because the lead character , Stephen Banning ( played by Dick Foran ) is now thirty years older and is relating the story ( with the help of archival footage ) to his son 's fiancé . There are only two unusual aspects to the film : the early death of Banning , and the presence of Turhan Bey.<br /><br />Lon Chaney as the mummy Kharis gets top billing , though given the nature of his role , he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about . There 's nothing scary about his presence , except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé , Isobel ( Elyse Knox ) . Dick Foran gets second billing , but he 's killed off within the first fifteen minutes ! We 'd have to wait until ' Psycho ' ( 1960 ) when a lead character ( Janet Leigh ) dies way before the end of the movie ! Banning 's buddy from the first film , Babe Jenson ( now Henson ) , shows up a little later looking much , much , older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original . It 's hard to believe it 's the same actor ! Unfortunately , this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by Kharis after only two brief scenes . It 's then left up to Banning 's son John ( played by bit player John Hubbard ) to led the chase to the cemetery -- NO ! The sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to Banning 's house to burn it down and kill the mummy . Sound Universally familiar ? < br /><br />Turhan Bey is introduced to audiences as the new High Priest , Mehmet Bey , to care for and feed tana leaves to Kharis . With his ' exotic ' voice and appearance , it 's too bad he gets so easily killed . A better movie would have had ' Babe ' take Von Helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy , with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay . But instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous Universal horror films , put together by the hack Griffin Jay who wrote many of Universal 's other clunkers , although he also did ' Don Winslow of the Navy ' ( 1942 ) as well as ' Don Winslow of the Coast Guard ' ( 1943 ) which also featured Elyse Knox.<br /><br />Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six Joe Palooka movies ( 1946 - 1949 ) , and of course , Turhan Bey , with 43 movie and TV credits , is great in the title role of ' The Amazing Dr. X ' ( 1948).<br /><br />The cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric ( with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff 's office ) than the first ' Kharis ' mummy film , but there 's little else of interest or excitement.<br /><br />I'll give it a 3 .
0 Jenny Neumann ( from the sexploitation flick MISTRESS OF THE APES , the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others ) is Helen Selleck , an American actress who gets a lead role in an Australian stage production . She 's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her . Meanwhile , a black - gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass.<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILER***<br /><br />The killer is obviously Helen ( she speaks in her dead mother 's voice , washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl ! ) , but this has gratuitous heavy - breathing POV camera - work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it 's supposed to be some big surprise.<br /><br />The entire cast seems obsessed with talking about , having or trying to have sex , and , in one case , even blackmailing their way into getting laid . There 's quite a bit of nudity and blood , but there 's no sense of continuity , the photography is murky and the editing ( by Colin Eggleston , who also scripted and produced ) is terrible . The theater setting for a slasher film predates Soavi 's film of the same name and Argento 's OPERA ( both of which are better than this one ) by five years though , and Neumann is pretty hot .
0 This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies . You remember this famous " Conditioned Reflex " experiment from your school books , right ? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal 's reflexes . Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and , after a while , he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell . What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low - budgeted Aussie slasher flick , I hear you think ? Well , the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in " Nightmares " is an exact variant on Pavlov 's experiment . Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window , because he / she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims . So this means that , after a short while , inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass . That way they still do n't miss anything special ! < br /><br />Regarding the quality of " Nightmares " as a film I can be very brief . This is a cheap , uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash - in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies . In the early 60 's , a four - year - old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident . Twenty years later the same girl  Helen Selleck  is a successful stage actress , but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares . She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part . Shortly after the big premiere , everyone who 's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered . It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer 's identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already . I do n't think I 've ever seen a more obvious whodunit than " Nightmares " and the creators should have just showed his / her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment . The murders are explicit and very bloody and there 's also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to " enjoy " . However , the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative . The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage . The only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic , whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do . " Nightmares " is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema , but hey , at least I gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible .
0 I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that do n't particularly hold my interest , but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children . Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children 's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children 's movies . Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.<br /><br />Technically , the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over - dubbed and unnatural . Personally I hate that , but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project . The " acting " reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices . Thankfully it was a very short movie.<br /><br />Now , before I come off like a video - geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick , the one thing that can save even the worst children 's movie is a positive message . Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is . Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given : < br /><br />If you are lost , do n't worry , you will inevitably find your way home.<br /><br />Approach wild animals without any fear.<br /><br />You can win any competition just because you " know " you can.<br /><br />and my favorite , the final message left in the film : < br /><br />It 's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right .
0 OK , I have been a huge fan of the Black for a long time and was DISGUSTED after seeing this film . Let 's name the problems ... First this film has much of the same crew that the first two had . It has also been called the PREQUEL to the original Black Stallion . Why is it that they ca n't get Shetan 's dam 's name correct or her color ? ? In The Black Stallion Returns , we learn the Sagr was the Black 's CHESTNUT mother and in this film she is a gray mare name Jenny ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? WTF ? And it 's set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940 's as well when the ship wrecks . Time line does n't sound quite right to me . Also , as a goof , there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be Shetan 's father ... upon further notice it appears to be a gelding . Ben Ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way . Might be a cute family film to some but it 's my biggest movie disappointment of the year .
0 This movie was a real torture fest to sit through . Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self - evidently a ' bad thing ' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it . When it does stoop to putting in its argument , it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that 's missing is someone crying " when is someone going to think of the children ! " . While watching this movie , I kept thinking " where 'd you hear that ? " or " that ca n't possibly be true " - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources . And bless 'em , the ' regular folks ' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power ; to be fair , that might be the fault of the film - makers , but equally fairly , it 's a condition shared by the movie 's rock stars.<br /><br />As for the performers ........... Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I 've enjoyed , and I 'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause . But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over , now that the 60s have passed them by . Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor . Nash seems to be trying too hard - he looks like he ca n't possibly believe the things he 's being told ( not that I blame him ) , but desperate to feel noticed and included . James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest " anthem " ever , " Stand and Fight " , in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine . In fact , most of the performances are pretty bland when they 're not being patronizing . Nobody seems worked up by this event , as if it really does n't mean much to them at all . It 's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall , of the band Orleans , and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the 70s . ( Remember , if you dare , " Dance With Me " and " Still the One " . ) It 's worth noting because that 's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music . The cause is supposedly life - or - death , but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they 're playing the Catskills . Except maybe Gil - Scott Heron - his protest number " We Almost Lost Detroit " is on topic at least , but delivered with all the smugness of a high - schooler impressed with how ' controversial ' he 's being.<br /><br />Only Bruce Springsteen 's performance raises a pulse ; I 've never been a big fan of the Boss , but he absolutely smokes , no question . Part of me thinks he was taped separately , at another event , and edited into this movie to give wake the audience . Compared to the general blandness and air of self - satisfaction here , it 's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll.<br /><br />But even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting . I do n't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a ' 70s film , but the shots are unnecessarily static , broken up only by split - second cutaways to a back - up singer 's tonsils . Now , some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with ; and * maybe * the film - makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch " Rust Never Sleeps " or " The Last Waltz " to see a movie like this done with more skill . And with more exciting musicians . < br /><br />So really , there 's only two things to watch this movie for : Springsteen 's stellar performance , and as a sad snapshot about a counter - culture in decline .
0 Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south Atlantic.<br /><br />The treasure - hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces . Wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old Spanish galleon filled with gold bullion.<br /><br />After the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing , shoving , arguing , and listening to Wilde 's annoying health tips , 5 crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things . Now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark 's stomach looks like.<br /><br />At least Wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in ' The Naked Prey ' 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition.<br /><br />Made on a budget of 75 cents .
0 Sheesh ! What a dreadful movie . Dodgy camera work , a script with more corn than Kellogg 's , and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it . < br /><br />To cap it all , it does n't know which audience to aim at - we have Cornel Wilde - or is that Corny Wilde ? - getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette , dear oh dear , and in another awkward scene we have the baddie , Lobo , forcing his , ahem , if you will , ' male friend ' to do a striptease dressed in a bikini . Try explaining that one to the kids ... <br /><br />Throw in an overly contrived Treasure Island - cum - Jaws type storyline , and the result is a film so unintentionally funny , it 's enjoyable - I should n't expect a Special Edition DVD any time soon , though .
0 By far the worst movie of all time . Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey . I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled " The Treasure " but was changed to " Sharks ' Treasure " in order to take advantage of the excitement created by " Jaws " . I think sharks were in one scene of this movie ; the fact that they happened to be included in this " thriller " was supposed to sell tickets . Did n't work . Anytime something " good " happens in the movie , the ship 's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made . Gee , do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor ? Could they have made it any more obvious ? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing . That 's cause enough for celebration .
0 Elizabeth Ward Gracen , who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton 's " bimbo eruptions " ( they have pills for that now ! ) is probably the weakest element of this show . It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander Series- The hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met , but there is some conflict , and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.<br /><br />Then you have the character of Nick Wolf . Basically , your typical unshaven 90 's hero , with the typical " Sexual tension " storyline . ( Seriously , why do you Hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex . ) This was a joint Canadian / French production , so half the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York , and the other half is in Paris ... Just like Highlander did .
0 In recent times I have been subjected to both this movie and " King Arthur " , on DVDs chosen by others for an evening 's " entertainment " and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion I have that the modern movie - watching public totally lacks discrimination , and is content as long as they get " action " . Both movies were utter rubbish.<br /><br />Whatever happened to character development ? Whatever happened to meaningful dialogue ? Whatever happened to ACTING ? And , when watching something that vaguely purports to be " historical " , whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy , some realistic idea of the " political map " of the time , even some slight flavour of the era , especially in its social attitudes . Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America ? I have read on the message boards of disclaimers that " little was known " of the dark ages . Not so . Considerable amounts are known , with much learned scholarship on the era , but these jokers simply could n't be bothered to do any homework.<br /><br />I only wish I could vote 0/10
0 This is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I 'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated < br /><br />To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word " plot " is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such . There 's something involving Russian gangsters , a character called Pete Thompson who 's trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant , and an Irish bloke called Sean . How they all fit into something called a " plot " I 'm not sure . It 's difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I 'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained < br /><br />Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you 'll be watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she 's doing nothing to become inconsistent . Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this < br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it 's utterly forgettable . I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now I 've mainly forgotten why . But this does n't alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
0 Where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?<br /><br />Do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes ? The over - the - top acting ? The dreadful script?<br /><br />No . You just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at . I know I do . I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like Empire ( usually a bad sign if a preview copy is n't available to the quality movie mags ) . However , cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer is n't happy with the finished product.<br /><br />I went three days after it opened with two other mates . The only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.<br /><br />And that was on cheap night.<br /><br />Either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.<br /><br />Not since the days of The Avengers ( 1998 ) have I felt so short changed since watching a movie . If a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set ; Keith Allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage ; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance , Rhys Ifans does his career no favours after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary.<br /><br />Mind you , considering she used to be in The Word , any viewers ' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with.<br /><br />The production values are n't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious . If you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say " Fak ! " for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.<br /><br />Otherwise , bargepoles required.<br /><br / >
0 I read James Hawes book . It was pretty neat , not great , but entertaining enough . Without having read the book I would n't have had the slightest idea what was going on , and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.<br /><br />Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways I do not have the capacity to describe . Half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.<br /><br />Never before or since as a film made me feel so angry . The Mattress sequels came closest , but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.<br /><br />Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry . That is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh*t . No , that 's unfair . Let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminium.<br /><br />Plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema .
0 I usually try to construct reasonably well - argued critiques of films , but I can not believe this got past the script stage . The dialogue is appalling , the acting very dodgy , the accents just awful , and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best.<br /><br />I do n't remember the last time I saw a film quite this bad . Joseph Fiennes , pretty as he is , might just have killed his career as quickly as it started.<br /><br />The Island of Doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage .
0 I felt Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours , the plot line was thin and confusing , the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents . The camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey , it just made it even more difficult to watch . One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience . The best performances were n't anything to do with acting . In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people , although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary . DO NOT under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep , there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash .
0 In the wake of Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , the British film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late ' 90s - early ' 00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then . In one of the all - time great cases of pearls - from - swine , the producers of Rancid Aluminium brazenly plastered the quote ' The best film of the century ' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because , at the time of writing , it was the only film that had been released in 2000 . Looking at it today it 's hard to imagine how it ever got made , uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannia 's Lads Mags Brigade  Rhys Ifans , Sadie Frost , Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel . That the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no - one really knows what it is , or perhaps simply do n't think it matters . Something to do with Ifans ' businessman being set up with Steven Berkoff 's homicidal Russian crime lord in a money - laundering or investment scheme ( it 's never clear which because no - one ever asks ) by Fiennes ' crooked Irish accountant , who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his failing company . Things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on , Ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and Tara Fitzgerald 's ludicrously accented Russian temptress , Berkoff keeps on saying " Bizniss " and " Francis Drake " and Fiennes does a decent Irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love does n't mean he 's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts.<br /><br />When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr , you know a film is in deep trouble . With Poland standing in for a Russia filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that veers from John Barry pastiche to lounge music to Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western on a stylophone budget , it fails completely in the cool stakes it 's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own , sitting there like a joke shop dog turd .
0 I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film .... the road side bar scene in Russia . In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - " 50 Dollars .. you Drink and Talk " , but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could , so I declined to take this speaking part on . I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience .... and who knows ... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as " I 'll be Back " and " Quite Frankly My Dear , I Do n't Give a Damn " . Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as ' Heavy 1 ' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski . < br /><br />As time goes on , I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set , in South Wales hot - spot Barry Island , no one could tell me what the actual storyline was . The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it ..... things could certainly have been worse if I 'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films .... <br /><br />Still ..... On the positive side .... I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break . I had no idea who he was , as " Notting Hill " was yet to be released , and not an inkling that he might be Welsh . Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s . It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production ........
0 This film is about a man 's life going wrong . His business is failing , and he can not impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts.<br /><br />The plot is complete chaos . It simply does not make sense . In fact , nothing in the film makes sense . The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it . It is a shame , because the sets and costumes are done well , and are visually stimulating enough . The shots are well composed throughout the film . However , these redeeming features still can not make up for the bad plot and poor story telling . I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film . It is such a waste of their talents . This film is very bad . Avoid it ! !
0 Words really ca n't describe how bad this film is . I thought Zandalee was bad , but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off . This is just laughable ! Terrible script , poor direction , awful acting and you know what ? I ca n't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it is n't too long . If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment , book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money ( assuming that you need it ! ) . Incidentally , I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE . IT IS TERRIBLE !
0 this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today . Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors , so what went wrong ? i do n't know and simply i do n't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all . be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish . but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot . A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co - worker out of his father 's company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid , very stupid plot twists / devices . i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience . if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather , what about lock , stock .... that s the peak of the contemporary British crime film .....
0 There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this does n't help with the major downsides to the movie . I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they ca n't convince . Fiennes just ca n't do Irish and Fitzgerald is n't much better at Russian . When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing . As the for the major problem .... the plot .... was there one ? I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just could n't wait for the film to end ... it was ridiculous . Save 90 minutes of your life and do n't watch this movie !
0 I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad . That has been done in great detail already , many times over . The ' plot ' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide - boy / gangster - by - numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles . Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves . It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled , yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am only making these comments , and indeed the only reason I went to see the film , is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second ' heavy ' in the pub scene . It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan 's face in the bar in ' Russia ' ( it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island ) . My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras ' agency and this was his first part . Having seen the film , it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.<br /><br />I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released . I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so . In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD , I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red - hot , then jam them into your eye sockets . This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film .
0 This is a truly abysmal ` LOCK STOCK ' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script . I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk , they must have been bribed . A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I had n't have paid good money for it I 'd have turned it off after 10 minutes . Not the worst film i ve ever seen , that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie ' ( I use the term loosely ) ` GUMMO ' ( I feel like suing that so called ` director ' for the lost hour and a half of my life ) but this trash is nearly right down there with it . Definitely one of the worst 5 films I have ever seen . Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they do n't have a monopoly on truly awful films .
0 Just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film , I decided to write another review . I missed a few things out last time ... <br /><br />First , the script . Second , the acting . Third , Jesus Christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when Joseph Fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax!!!<br /><br />I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this when I could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or SOMETHING!<br /><br />Are you getting the picture ?
0 How can you gather this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure ? Horrible script , annoyingly hectic camera , awfully edited , gruesomely badly acted . Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life . Another painful proof that " different " sometimes equals " dreck " . Why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand ? Do yourself a favour : spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees . It 's less painful and more fun than this movie !
0 ... the first film I had to walk out on . And it was the cast and crew pre - screening ( Not that I was involved , I hasten to add ) . I made it through the first hour , so I reckon I 'm just qualified to comment , but that was my limit.<br /><br />Like other comments here , how did this get through any kind of QA . An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue , the epitome of wooden acting , awful casting , all wrapped together without a plot.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald 's casting was bizarre , almost comic . She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history.<br /><br />As I left the screening , the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema . They obviously could n't sit through it again either.<br /><br / >
0 We know from other movies that the actors are good but they can not save the movie . A waste of time . The premise was not too bad . But one workable idea ( interaction between real bussinessmen and Russian mafia ) is not followed by an intelligent script
0 I have seen bad films but this took the p***. Made no sense , and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds , oh and i think one has a low sperm count . Its that good . A welshman plays a sweary cockney . A posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy , and some lesser lights play dim tarts.<br /><br />And there are some Russian gangsters . Oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.<br /><br />Avoid this film like the plague .
0 Must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time , but this one is up there with the worst of them . Plot troubling to follow . Sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film.<br /><br />I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two . Sadly , in my case , I have the DVD . It will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time .
0 I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable . The plot was weak to say the least . I was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up ( I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs ? ) . At least I did n't pay to rent it . The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr , but the rest of the film is complete and utter PANTS .
0 Okay . So there are n't really that many great movies around . Recent gems like American Dream , The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 do n't normally come so close together . But boy ( ! ) does this film counter - balance the quality.<br /><br />I have NO idea what these people thought they were doing . Are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of * * * * ? I can just see it now ... <br /><br />Producer - " So we 've got Joe Fiennes . He 's cute as a button and was pretty good in Shakespeare in Love . And we 've got Rhys Ifans , who is n't cute but was cool in Notting Hill . We 'll mix in a really mediocre score , a few forgettable post - Britpop tunes , hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you 've got the worst film of the new millennium . And believe me , it 's gon na be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years." < br /><br />The Bank - " I like it ! Any unnecessary sex ? Bad camera movements ? And what about the worst accents this side of Devil 's Own?" < br /><br />Producer - " Yeah , we got plenty of those." < br /><br />The Bank - " Sounds great , where do we sign?" < br /><br />Please .
0 Well , what to say ... <br /><br />Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was ? ? V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point ... I had to look away from the screen , I was feeling physically sick ... Round and Round and Round .... You get the idea ... <br /><br />VERY VERY Strange accents at many points .... " Those that should know , know" < br /><br />Unless your getting in for free , or being paid to watch it , or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something .. then forget it ...
0 There have been some low moments in my life , when I have been bewildered and depressed . Sitting through Rancid Aluminium was one of these.<br /><br />The warning signs were there . No premiere ( even the stars did n't want to attend ) and no reviews in magazines . The only reason I sat through the film was in the hope that I might catch up on some sleep.<br /><br />Nothing in the film was explained . The narration was idiotic . I cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot , then to my growing despair , it was revealed that he had n't really been shot dampening my joy . I sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity . < br /><br />There were some positive aspects , mainly unintentional moments of humour . For example , the scene in which the main character , for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle , while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears.<br /><br />My words can not explain the anger I feel , so I shall conclude thus.<br /><br />Rancid Aluminium : for sadists , wastrels , and regressives only who want to torture themselves .
0 I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as " The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen".<br /><br />Even if you ignore the dodgy accents , low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it . I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.<br /><br />The simple answer is - they did n't . Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative . Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it 's climax you do n't care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from . But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.<br /><br />They even change the true meaning of the books title " Rancid Aluminium " by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title.<br /><br />A real mess of a film from start to finish .
0 This is absolutely the dumbest movie I 've ever seen . What a waste of a splendid cast . That 's James Cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy . I could go on and on , but I would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script . The only thing this movie is about is us vs. them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human being 's tolerance . This is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen -- and I LOVE James Garner .
0 I almost saw this at an actual movie theatre ( an art - house theatre , no less ! ) but could n't make it there in the one whole week it played , but yesterday I finally saw it on cable and ... well ... I was n't disappointed , that 's for sure ! Madonna has done it again : YET ANOTHER BOMB ! When will this woman learn ? When will the studios learn ? ( Or perhaps they already have , since this film was largely dumped , with little fanfare and deadly word - of - mouth . ) One would hope that being directed by her talented husband , who 's created some interesting and/or terribly entertaining work , would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in " Desperately Seeking Susan " ; alas , it just is n't meant to be , for here she is , at her very worst : singularly convinced of her own greatness , the smugness permeating every frame she 's in , made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux - British accent , an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant . This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman , and LOOK at her films of , say , the past decade : like a latter - day Bette Davis , there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body , which here , despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film ( perhaps its only saving grace ) , are done no favors . To her credit , the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world 's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess . No one involved escapes unharmed : Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be on - screen , though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she 's actually in something good , which had me thinking all the while , " Denial ai n't just a river in Egypt ! " Adriano Giannini , son of Giancarlo Giannini , star of the Italian original , " Swept Away ... " , is , like his father before him , immensely attractive , and is n't altogether bad ( despite winning a Razzie nomination for " Worst Actor " ) , but , like almost everything else about this production , it all comes back to Madonna , on whose shoulders rest the blame . Why her ? Why not her husband , director Guy Ritchie ? Just who do YOU think was behind this remake ? What actress would n't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her , with only a relative nobody sharing the screen ? Oh sure , Ritchie deserves some blame : surely he - or someone - ANYONE ! - should have , and could have , taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings ( for her performance is so wooden it 's a surprise the rest of the cast did n't get splinters ) , or at least display a semblance of warmth ... but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole . Above and beyond anything else , this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it . A film like this , an " Odd Couple "- ish , war of the classes , should be light and fun , with leads who can bounce off one another with witty , even romantic , dialogue , for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded , really be ? Honestly , I do n't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for ; it succeeds neither as comedy ( I defy you to laugh even once ) or romance ( Madonna 's ice - princess routine precludes ANY chemistry ) . It 's not even bad enough for us bad - movie lovers to enjoy . A real shame ...
0 I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind < br /><br />to it ( to say the least ) ... but it was terrible . Really terrible . Badly < br /><br />acted , a witless script , cack handed direction ... Watching this film was < br /><br />like watching a car crash- you want to look away but you keep staring < br /><br />because you want to see how messy it 's going to get . Well , the car is < br /><br />wrecked and there are no survivors . On the plus side , the cinematography < br /><br />was nice , made me want to go on holiday , if only to cleanse myself from < br /><br />this unholy
0 For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself , but the public eye , that she can act . Unfortunately , trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona does n't mix well.<br /><br />She seems to fare better when she 's NOT the star of any movie : if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN ( 1985 ) or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN ( 1992 ) , she actually comes off looking good . Since the story revolves on other actors , the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default.<br /><br />The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie , regardless the genre . Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way , whether it be good , mediocre or plain awful , she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance . This is the crucial difference between Madonna and , let 's say , Bette Davis , or Meryl Streep . The latter two , even if the movie were to fail ( because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it , or because the script fell short , or because the actress per se was just not at her moment ) , there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb . Both Davis and Streep have had their share : Bette , having a longer career than Streep , in such fare as BUNNY O'HARE ( 1971 ) and WICKED STEPMOTHER ( 1989 ) ; Streep in SHE - DEVIL ( 1989 ) . But at least there 's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance.<br /><br />Madonna , on the other hand , not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself , fares much worse , and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG ( 1992 ) , an inferior classic , she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff , maybe even nervous , as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just could n't let go.<br /><br />So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two - character movie . Guy Ritchie , more known for action movies filled in masculine energy , seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman , who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease . And at 89 minutes , the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn , it does n't feel sincere . From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love , this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaway 's Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS ( 1978 ) . Equally unconvincing is Adriano Giannini 's nasty turn around the middle of the movie -- it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic -- and when he gives in to Madonna 's love , it 's too quick to be believed . Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery does n't enhance or add upon this " transformation " from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other.<br /><br />Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well -- it only makes it drag , bog it down , and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close - up , it feels she 's trying too hard . Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little . Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s , early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion.<br /><br />Could the movie have been better ? Of course . There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again -- it 's been done before , in OVERBOARD ( 1987 ) , for example . It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change ( to ensure a moral tone ) . Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more " silent " film look -- as in PERSONA ( 1966 ) . It could have even been something of a thriller , providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM ( 1989 ) . Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top , uber - control freak getting her comeuppance . But with its mean streaked humor , without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom , and without really defining Giannini 's own character , this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes .
0 and forget this . Completely . If you really need to see Madonna act , rent " Body of Evidence " , at least Willem Defoe is in that one.<br /><br />In this film , while the sets are beautiful , you may want to mute the dialog . You wo n't miss anything . Bruce Greenwood is wasted , Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop , and Madonna is so awful , it becomes amusing . Why they had to butcher the original film into this mess , I will never know ; guess they thought it was " bankable " . Madonna , as an actress , certainly is NOT.<br /><br />If you rent the original film from 1979 , though , you will enjoy it , and the actors in it can actually act . 1/10 .
0 No doubt , when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married , it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers . If you 've been through the ordeal of watching " Swept Away , " then you know at that level it was a match made in hell . After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress ( or " octress " as she might have pronounced it in " The Next Best Thing " ) , she still ca n't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent . And that 's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen : that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience . If there 's any justice in this universe , she just blew her last chance .
0 * May contain spoilers*<br /><br />I bent over backwards to be fair to this film . I knew it starred Madonna . I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters . I knew it got a lot of bad reviews . I was n't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class , culture and sexuality like we got in the Italian original . The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes.<br /><br />Madonna plays a rich , pretentious , nit - witted Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends ( the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna , exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions ) . Adriano Giannini plays the ship 's first - mate who the Madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together . Why is she such a bitch to him ? Simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted Mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson . Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two - thirds of the movie.<br /><br />"Swept Away " is a silly , simplistic , superficial movie from beginning to end . Madonna gives a typically wooden performance . There are many dumb scenes : Madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of Giannini , a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt . Guy Ritchie does his " stylish " editing which is laughable here . The film contains some of the worst dialog I 've heard in a major movie in several years . The ending is sappy and implausible . It 's basically " The Blue Lagoon " meets " Overboard " minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter.<br /><br />Maybe Madonna 's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress . Please give it up , Madge , for our sake as well as yours . This is n't her worst movie though . That distinction still belongs to " Shanghai Surprise " . She has n't made anything worse than that ... yet .
0 * * * WARNING ! SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN ! * * * < br /><br / > This is a semi - autobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island . There 's absolutely no challenge to Madonna in this role , and it shows . She 's just Madonna playing Madonna , and she ca n't even get THAT right . I know what you 're saying , you 're saying , " How do you know this is what Madonna is really like , you 've never met her ! " Correct , I have n't , but we all remember " Truth or Dare " , do n't we ? I know Kevin Costner does.<br /><br / > You would think , in the year 2002 , that Madonna might have learned something , one way or the other , from the " crossover " ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen . For goodness ' sake , has n't Madonna seen " Glitter " ? Mariah Carey showed the film world HOW IT IS DONE ! ! ! Mariah kicks Madonna 's trashy butt to the curb in beauty , talent , screen presence , charisma , characterization , you name it ! All we see from this glimpse into Madonna 's world is she 's the only one in it . < br /><br / > If there 's one thing to be said for Madonna , it is that she 's consistent . When she was an MTV darling , she set the world of women 's fashion back 20 years . Now , in film , she has set women 's roles in film AND society back 20 years , by glamourizing all the most hated , horrible , reprehensible , odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them , qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really do n't possess.<br /><br / > * * * HERE 'S THE SPOILERS ! ! ! DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ... ***<br /><br / > Here 's the one good thing I will say about this film , and I really was impressed by it . They did n't go for the " Hollywood Ending " - Madonna 's character lives . In the typical , happy Hollywood ending , Madonna 's character would have died on the island , and her long - suffering , oppressed , whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good , decent woman , a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife , and they both live happily ever after . But in this extremely depressing conclusion , she is rescued , and once more , this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife , and his life will once again become a living hell.<br /><br / > * * * HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS * * *
0 I had the ( mis)fortune to see this film at a showing in the US . Having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing , I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB . < br /><br />The original film was a turkey , but an interesting one . It fitted into that early seventies , post 1969 revolution thing ; this film just stinks of ....... , well , nothing really . It 's that bad.<br /><br />Imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what I mean ? < br /><br />Madonna never could act , and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years . She looks worse and worse with every one of those years , increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie , who has built his " reputation " on Lock Stock , could never direct either - his movies are shallow , badly cut , fashion shows . He does n't disappoint here either ; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle.<br /><br />Please people , take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below . They are quite obviously business plants.<br /><br />Don't encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money.<br /><br / >
0 It 's not my fault . My girlfriend made me watch it.<br /><br />There is nothing positive to say about this film . There has been for many years an idea that Madonna could act but she ca n't . There has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director but he is only middling . An embarrassment all round . < br /><br / >
0 I do n't know what some of you are smoking , but i suspect it 's potent.<br /><br />To call Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness . The acting is hideous and i 'm not picking on Madonna here , we all know she 's useless , but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious . My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines . The editing is so sloppy , it beggars description . The photography and composition ( which in this era , competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget ) are astonishingly inept , even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking . These are BASIC elements of filmmaking , if you ca n't get them right , you should seek another line of work . It 's as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White , except nowhere near as well made or interesting.<br /><br />The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor , superbly acted and written , featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair . The sexual tension feels real and immediate ... those of you who found Guy Ritchie 's version deplorable , should see it , it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema.<br /><br />Those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined .
0 Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller 's film is incomprehensible.<br /><br />This new film is a mess . There was one other person in the audience when I saw it , and she left about an hour into it . ( I hope she demanded a refund . ) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I 've never walked out of a movie.<br /><br />But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film . The dialogue is laughable , the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery . Ritchie took Lina 's movie and turned it into another " Blue Lagoon." < br /><br />This is a film that you would n't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax . Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this .
0 Guy Ritchie 's noble effort is beat up , knocked down , raped , kicked around , shot , stabbed , spit upon , punched , sodomized , and abused and left for dead by Madonna 's dreadful performance . Her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking . Guy Ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this , and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in , it 's a fair movie at best . I think that the best acting job ever , had to be Guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re - shoot . If you have an opportunity of watching Swept Away or clipping your toenails for 89 minutes ... go for the extended pedicure .
0 This film story is bad enough , which can happen in real life . I 'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film . I say it was bad because there is some reason . 1 . if Madonna was rich and can do everything she want , then why she falling in love with that bad man . 2 . How can the story script is so weak ? She was so rich , can do everything she want , but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible.<br /><br />The words I LOVE YOU , it does n't meant anything in this film .
0 This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton " whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant . Madonna did OK in some movies however this one does n't fire . If there is any picture that show Madonna ca n't act it is this one.<br /><br />I am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of " The Admirable Crighton " but it sure looks like it and if that s the case then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad . to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail.<br /><br />The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre . The script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location . While many here have canned Madoona for all her acting I think that in films like " A League of Their own " was quite good and enjoyable and " Who 's That Girl " showed a quirkiness of Madonna 's style not shown before or afterwards . Other Madonna films are not as enjoyable and I would have liked a to see a Madonna Animation series with the character from " Who 's That Girl " I like the music from these two films however " Swept away " remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so.<br /><br />everyone has a bomb right ?
0 AKA : Mondays In The Sun < br /><br />I have no idea what I just watched . Three men wander aimlessly and drink , grousing about everything and at everyone in their path . This is supposed to be a drama , but what it is , is a total waste of film , without a single redeeming quality.<br /><br />I have read reviews touting the performances herein as " wonderful , " " beautiful , " and " heroic . " I 'm afraid I can not agree , unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto - humans who ever walked.<br /><br />All in all ? This was not a movie . It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience . I 've watched this three times , and can not for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage . There is nothing profound here , whatsoever . It 's crap.<br /><br />It rates a ZERO/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully , one is a romantic . When things are show unbearably grim , they are realistic . And when something gets the ironic treatment , they 're spot on . Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa , he falls into the second catagory . This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish " Ken Loach " type movie , without being able to capture the comedy , and warmth between the characters , that elevate Loach movies from merely being ' depressing ' . Los Lunes al Sol , is just that , only depressing . Things are unrealistically grim . The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point , and if the glum story is n't enough , Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette . The films was ridiculously over - rated at the Goyas . A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society , in this case unemployed harbour workers , does not automatically make for a good movie , even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people . This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate . In 21st century Spain , unemployed people do not live like beggars , and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms , and it 's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it . Leon de Aranoa obviously does n't have a clue about working class Spain , and does it no favours . Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw . The scene where the men watch a football match for free , has been directly copied from a film which deals much more ' realistically ' with the subject of the ' poverty ' trap , namely " Purely Belter , " which is afar more engaging , humorous , and yet sad .
0 This movie is painfully slow and has no plot . It conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers . One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job . There may be some social commentary here , but , it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light.<br /><br />I do not understand why it had a 7.8 when I decided to watch it . I watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff . No luck . The IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes . Anything above 6.5 was worth watching.<br /><br />And my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie . He 's not my type , so , my agreement does not mean much.<br /><br />Sigh . I give it a 1 .
0 A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class " artist " with a comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer - director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it . If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story , unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers , have no anger , no fear , no frustration , etc . All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks , boyish jokes . They do never look for work , the do almost never experience rejection or anguish , etc . Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school ... Ridiculous . Specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of Ken Loach , etc .
0 This move is slow , plodding , cold , dark , and without a plot or hope . It follows that tried and true European formula that they love to subsidize , that is never seen , but that the critics think makes an " important point".<br /><br />The movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between Americans and Europeans regarding employment . In this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it 's the government 's duty to provide them with work . Whereas in the U.S. we know we have to go out there and create value for someone.<br /><br />Spain never looked so backward !
0 Gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story . It 's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash Pakistan . The movie 's aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that Pakistan and it 's government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws wo n't work . And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad . Most likely the Sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided . The movie sucks and sucks with power . I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie . If i can give 0 out of 10 I would but the lowest is 1.Please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie .Disaster .
0 Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood worst overrated movies ever . Directed by Anil Sharma , who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie . The songs were boring and ai n't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car , full volume . Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies , where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own . He even kicks a metal jail door ( Indian ) and kicks a moving car far away ( Teesri Aankh ) . I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol . But I 'm sure most people know this already . Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role . A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece , by using violence . Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone . But even she could n't save the film from being a disaster . Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does , in this movie she does n't . Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim , but she does n't act like one in the movie . Overall , this is a poor show all the way , I 'm sure it will appeal to some people , who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys . Give me a break .
0 This warning against anti - semitism is well - meant and may have had its purpose at the time , but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film . The director has no idea about mise - en - scene ; the cast varies from bad till even worse.<br /><br />The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted . In his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy , that is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari ; one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities.<br /><br />The restored copy I saw ( Dutch Filmmuseum ) gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place , but may be the original editing was bad as well .
0 an acted / manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of guatemala . portrayed as a fun , secure ... but sad place , were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team , assembled in what seems like no more than a week ! the documentary 's main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of " workers " , even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved , except that the people who documented this , made them some sort of " stars " ( just like the title says so ) in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary . it does have , however , its own documented reality ... but , that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline . i would not accept to see it again ; but i would recommend it for general cultural purposes only .
0 This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting ( mainly from the supporting characters ) . The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself ... <br /><br />Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool . The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment.<br /><br />If you have never seen Rio , or the inside of a British bank , this film is for you . 2 out of 10 .
0 Richard Dix is a big , not very nice industrialist , who has nearly worked himself to death . If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him , can he find happiness for the last months of his life ? Well , he 'll likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER.<br /><br />This William Castle directed entry has some great moments ( the introduction and the depiction of Richard Dix 's life through newsreel a la Citizen Kane ) , and some intriguing plotting in the final reels . Dix 's performance is generally pretty good . But , unfortunately , the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do . Also , the movie veers from a dark ( and fascinating beginning ) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection ( full of nice urban ethnic types who do n't mind that they are n't rich ) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />This is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role .
0 Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini - series ever made on this planet.<br /><br />The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense : Just two examples : Visby was shown as a village of three houses . Instead , it was a major city at this time , it 's best days already passed by . Secondly , Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea . Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea , the major town at that time was Lübeck.<br /><br />But worse than all that : The directing ! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this ? Impossible ! There was not a single believable scene it , the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.<br /><br />I ca n't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent .
0 How can a major German TV station broadcast a mess like this ? It 's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even the well - known Gottfried John is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish ....... ! The screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie . Be careful not to fall asleep while watching ! The set is obviously very often a blue screen , f.g . the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background ... ! In the German version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason : different languages of actors - but : other international productions do handle this much more professional . Advice : Do NOT watch - it 's a diabolic waste of time !
0 This is a fascinating film -- especially to old movie buffs and historians ( I am both ) . During the first half of the twentieth century , sadly , Black Americans were usually not allowed into White theaters . As a result , theaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black actors . In many cases , the films were essentially similar plot - wise to standard Hollywood fare , but with a much , much lower budget -- and usually horrid production values . You really ca n't fault the film makers -- they just did n't have the money and resources available to the average film company . As a result , they had to make due with a lot less -- including an over - reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again , no money for re - shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST ! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film -- starring Herb Jeffries instead . Jeffries was a light - skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films . In each , he sings a little , fights a little ( though VERY poorly ) and loves a little -- everything you need in a cowboy . Believe it or not , Jeffries is STILL alive at age 96.<br /><br />The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picture -- complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West ! The problem is that despite its similarities , the low budget shines through . Stymie ( from the Li'l Rascals ) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in , the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film , there were some odd plot holes , there was no background music ( leaving the film strangely quiet ) and the acting was pretty awful.<br /><br />Now this does NOT mean that the film is n't worth seeing -- only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher . One reviewer , oddly , scored this film a 10 ! How this can be with all the problems is beyond me . However , I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems . The plot is generally pretty good , the characters likable , the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it 's a very important piece of American history . But a 10 ! ? < br /><br />By the way , in an odd bit of casting , the very tall , lean and almost white - skinned Jefferies is paired with short , dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland .... as his brother ! ! Also , Spencer Williams may be familiar to you . He played Andy on TV 's " Amos ' n Andy " .
0 I have to agree with most everyone 's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written . The acting was not much more above the lower production values however I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it . In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer . I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit " Dead Like Me " where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner . I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader . I felt as though if anyone might " make it " from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure . If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the ' Godfather ' or perhaps ' Beaches ' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low - budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying " It 's a start ! "
0 In the U.S. , very few films have been made about Rome that were not set in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter . Hollywood 's sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme , which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history ( Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule , and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it).<br /><br />It 's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ , but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula , and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic.<br /><br />However , this is not a historical film ; it 's peplum , and while the production values are n't rock bottom , the acting and characterizations are cardboard . I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian , but with wooden English dubbing it 's very campy . I got a few good laughs out of it at first.<br /><br />I have n't seen many films of this genre , having missed most of the Hercules movies of the 60s . It 's amusing up to a point , but as the film goes on , it gets somewhat boring.<br /><br />One thing 's for sure : if I 'd seen this movie when I was ten years old , I would have loved it . At that age , I went for anything with Romans and swordfights in it . So at least , this flick brought back some childhood memories .
0 It 's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts , but I know that humor is VERY subjective . I have seen all of their sound shorts ( by far the best of their stuff IMO ) and I found this one of their weaker efforts.<br /><br />In the year this was made ( 1930 ) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature . They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly . In addition , this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan . I would say this was an experiment that really did not work . As someone else said , it does not play to their strengths . Too much dialog and plot.<br /><br />The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about " girl " stuff.<br /><br />If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out Blotto , or Brats From the same year.<br /><br />They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts . They made something like 108 films altogether . Very few ( except for the ones made at FOX ) were outright failures but there are some . County Hospital , Me And My Pal , The Live Ghost , The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones . But other then those I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts . Quite a record in my book.<br /><br />If you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out , but I would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to Stan and Babe .
0 The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps , accidents and destruction , mostly caused by Stan , but with Ollie receiving the bulk ( ! ) of the punishment-- see the great ' The Music Box ' ( 1933 ) or ' Towed in a Hole ' ( 1932 ) as some some classic examples.<br /><br />Here , however , for some reason ( is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan 's father ? ) the boys play it ' straight ' in a ' comedy ' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations . It does n't come off . It 's merely another third - rate tedious 30s comedy , heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures ( Ollie 's finger wiggling , Stan 's blank stares , etc . ) or comic abilities.<br /><br />The film begins with them running from the police . Since we never see or know why , it 's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught , and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshot 's mansion . The premise for the ' humor ' , Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging . They are not playing ' Stan and Ollie ' in this film . Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.<br /><br />Stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny , but he does n't get the chance to do any of that here . He 's constrained by uttering too much dialog to ' move ' the plot , but none of it rises much above the silly . We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree 's name , the " Call me a cab ! Okay you 're a cab ! " joke , cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns , and a non - sequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two , and James Finlayson is still doing his silent - era full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in ' Sons of the Desert'(1933 ) where we get to see them do what we love about them -- be themselves . In fact , 1932 - 34 seem to be their best years.<br /><br />Since this film does not play to any of their strengths , why bother with it ? I have to give it a 3 .
0 Because some people , like me , like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it , including the ending . Anyway , here 's the ending as I remember it , because I could n't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV . But I 'll tell ya , it sure scared the little kid that I was , and I thought about it for days afterward , and it still stands out in my mind to this day , even though some of the details are a little vague . Abe Vigoda was in this movie ? I do n't remember that ! I did n't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie , and I LOVED Dark Shadows . So , at the end , the lead character ( Belinda Montgomery ? ) is lured by the Judge ( Joseph Cotton , I 'm guessing , even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge ; see how memory fades ? ) to the wedding place , which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind ? Maybe I 've got that wrong ; and Shelley Winters is there laughing , and the Judge has a cape on , and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him , and he throws back the cloak , and he has goat legs , and he announces he 's actually her father , the Devil , and she 's played right into their ( the satanic cult 's ) hands , because the " mortal " guy she has fallen in love with ( I guess that 's Robert Foxworth ) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to , The Demon with Yellow Eyes , and yep , sure enough , they show Robert Foxworth , and his eyes glow yellow . There are a lot of close - ups in the last few minutes of the film . Everyone is laughing and rejoicing , except for Belinda Montgomery , who is very unhappy , and cries or screams or something , and that 's the end . The bad guys win .
0 Forbidden Siren is based upon the Siren 2 Playstation 2 ( so many 2s ) game . Like most video game turned movies , I would say the majority do n't translate into a different medium really well . And that goes for this one too , painfully.<br /><br />There 's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story , and the mysterious island on which a writer ( Leo Morimoto ) and his children , daughter Yuki ( Yui Ichikawa ) and son Hideo ( Jun Nishiyama ) come to move into . The villagers do n't look all too friendly , and soon enough , sound advice is given about the siren on the island , to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing.<br /><br />Naturally and slowly , things start to go bump , and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants . But in truth , you will not bother with what 's going on , as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more . What was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill - placed - out - of - the - norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity , until it 's explained much later . It 's one thing trying to come up and present something smart , but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered.<br /><br />Despite it clocking in under 90 minutes - I think it 's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark - it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to . Things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes , but it 's a classic case of too little too late.<br /><br />What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end . Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience . It turned out rather satisfactorily , but leaves a bad aftertaste as you 'll feel cheated somewhat . There are two ways a twist will make you feel - it either elevates the movie to a memorable level , or provides you with that hokey feeling . Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter.<br /><br />The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light , shadows and mirrors , but I will be that explicit - it 's still not worth the time , so better to avoid this .
0 Is it just me or is that kid really annoying?<br /><br />Hideos sister , spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so . As for him , well , I know he 's a kid n all , but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree . So far I 'm only half way through , and am fascinated by the story , but the people in it , let it down , I just hope it gets better by the end , as I ca n't not know what it 's all about . Although , some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook , indicate everything is backwards , i.e. Dog is God , Live is Evil etc ... just seems a little obvious at the moment , yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning , ( As yet anyway ) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie , I 'll update this post , but if your reading this , then well ...... See above statement .
0 I was fully amped up to see this film . I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand . I should n't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark 's worst film There is so much wrong with this film . First off , some of the acting is great , in particular Nick Stahl as ' The Bully ' , and the girl with the curly brown hair ( I ca n't recall her name ) , but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable , especially Leo Fitzpatrick . He 's a veteran of Clark 's films now and he was so brilliant in ' Kids ' , but in ' Bully ' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually . The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student . No sorry , a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before . And I could n't fathom Clark 's intentions . Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids ' existence ? It sure as hell did n't stop him getting in a damn good perv . I 'm no prude but I did n't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes . I still maintain that Clark 's best film is ' Another Day in Paradise ' . It 's fantastic and I do n't think he 'll ever top it .
0 It , at all , you have seen when harry met sally , then avoid this one . It will not only make you bang your head on the table as why ca n't bollywood even make a good remake ; but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it . The charm of the movie is missing . Ranee looks terrible . Saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor . The plots that have been picked up from the original , do n't look effective either . The part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note , it just does n't look appealing . What can be more disastrous ? you wanna waste some money , this is what you can get . Otherwise , put some more bucks , and watch the original . Its too good to miss ..
0 If they could get Ed Asner why did n't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers ? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger . It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability . I guess that s why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work . If the d - bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long - distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better . He has good reason to be jealous , good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective , controlling manipulative father . All the characters that are meant to be likable are n't and everyone else is the ' bad ' boyfriend . How did they meet anyway , a wine broker and a saw mill worker ?
0 Watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels.<br /><br />I guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute Christmas movie , but were extremely disappointed.<br /><br />the actor playing the soldier , seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever , his face looks the same , whether he 's chopping down Christmas tree 's , seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend , or when he 's happily surprised by the girl he loves , he 's an awful actor , and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him.<br /><br />Then there 's the cute blond girl , blessed with the ability to count dot 's and cheat on her boyfriend , what a catch ! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots.<br /><br />So it 's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend , it 's as predictable as it get 's , and really a waste of time , you gain nothing by watching this , other than some weird laughs , because it 's all so corny.<br /><br />I love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine , and they all laugh , that 's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about , furthermore , if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like , i 'd tell him a thing or to , but not our army veteran , no sir , he let 's everyone boss him around.<br /><br />The movie is what First Blood would have been , if John Rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world .
0 This film deserves another bad review . Consider one reviewer extolling the film 's virtues that include ' no sex , violence or gore . ' Uh , excuse me . The very set - up of the film has us watching as Cody 's young comrade , with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving Cody holding his lifeless , bloody body . And , given the nature of war we know that Cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis . So much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines Cody 's persona is erased from viewer memory.<br /><br />Sans any family of his own Cody , like John Rambo , roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown USA in the guise of some place called Nevada City . No mention , no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged goods . We know this since his CO practically declares him so as he order Cody to ' get some rest ' away from the death and destruction of war . This explains , as none seem to notice or care , Cody 's obvious ' flat ' effect . It is not bad acting . It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder . Not guessing here , remember his CO ordered him off the battle field.<br /><br />How about that ' accidental ' kiss as noted by another review . The fall was an accident , the kiss was not . How exactly was Cody ' respecting ' Faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for ? Now that was a non - family value moment . A moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on YouTube . Of course faith 's lapse of fidelity as well as Cody 's ' coming on ' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the Xmas season , all CHEERING their cheaten ' hearts and lips.<br /><br />We know little about Faith 's fiancé except that she professes her love for him , she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal ( could have waited if any second thoughts ) , he is generous , he loves her to death , the family has nothing really against him , he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans . No evil doers here.<br /><br />Asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like ' we love you son .... ' ' You are part of our family ' literally days after they have met a stranger named Cody . And the ' band of brothers ' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field.<br /><br />Bottom line : This film is cotton candy Xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways . Most grossly when it applauds Cody 's disrespect for Faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for . By re - defining family as we know it to wit : accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all ' love you . ' How many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that . NOT .
0 I 'm stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did . It 's an innocuous , sweet , uncomplicated cliché ' of a film that had two big names from the past in it ( both of whom did a decent job ) , but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels . I like a good romance as well as anyone , but as my wife and I were watching this -- and before we saw the rating - we said , " There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there 's nothing in it to challenge their brains , their faith , their comfort level or their cultural preferences . It 's possible to make a good film like that ( and Away from Her is an example ) , but this was amateur hour . There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one . Truly , another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films . Watch The Family Stone . It 's miles ahead of this schlock .
0 Sorry my fellow Nevada City neighbors , but this one is bad.<br /><br />Brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie.<br /><br />Alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside . She was stiff throughout the movie.<br /><br />I looked up both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work . I would have guessed that they were first - year students.<br /><br />Ed Asner and Peter Jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line . Ed certainly has not lost his charisma . I wish I 'd taken the time to meet him while he was here.<br /><br />I love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because I 've been there . I make Nevada City my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere . I was sadly disappointed.<br /><br />Sorry .
0 I watched this film on the Hallmark Channel recently . In my opinion , the film started out decent enough , but eventually got sour.<br /><br />The Story : A U.S. soldier in Afghanistan receives one of the Christmas cards that a woman back in the U.S. has sent out to troops for Christmas . He becomes so inspired by the Christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life , a motivation to continue on . When he is given leave , he goes to the very town that the woman lives in . He comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the Christmas card . He meets the family and after saving her dad ( a Vietnam War Veteran ) from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street , the family decides to take him in for a while . We learn that he does n't have a family back home . The soldier agrees to help out the family during the Christmas season by working with them at their logging company . The family comes to love him and vice - versa . The soldier also becomes in love with the family 's daughter - the woman that sent the Christmas card . There 's only one problem . She already has a serious relationship with a man that she 's in love with . It 's also a long distance relationship . The boyfriend is very different from the soldier . He prefers wine and trips to France over hard labor and the great outdoors . The woman prefers the latter . Throughout the rest of the film , there is a " love triangle " as the woman 's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season . Everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what 's best for her daughter . * * ( SPOILER ALERT ) * * The woman comes to like the soldier more and more , as they have a lot in common . They happen to spend a lot of time together . She gradually becomes attracted to his persona . Then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back . Now she 's so confused ! She 's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday , but she 's become so fond of the soldier . Soon enough , the boyfriend ( who does n't know about the kiss , but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her ) decides to propose to the woman and she accepts . His plans for their marriage , however , are not plans that she wants . She wants to be at home , have kids and be close to her family . He wants to travel the world , go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along . This does n't sound too thrilling for the woman . However , the soldier feels bad about what he 's done and does n't want to make things worse . So , he decides to leave town , despite the dad 's urging him to stay and be with his daughter . It all comes to a head when , at the Christmas Eve service with Church , we find out that the soldier has n't left yet . The boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he , broken - hearted , basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her . The film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together.<br /><br />Things I like : I like the soldier throughout much of the film . He 's basically nice and polite , with a strong sense of doing good for others ; there are moments in which the family is going with Church and participating in charitable causes ; the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table ; the dad and mom have a long - lasting and evidently healthy marriage ; the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong < br /><br />Things I do n't like : There is a very typical " love triangle " story in this film ; the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend ; most of the family practically applauds this behavior - the family goes with Church and participates in services , yet this is how they act ; there is some bad language < br /><br />Conclusion : I became disappointed as the film ran on , and it got worse and worse . I ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because I had enough . So , the film started out decent with some few gem moments , but ended up ruining itself . Therefore , I do n't recommend this film to anyone .
0 A movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword . I 've seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess I do n't think I can ever watch a another movie again . May God pity the souls who made this.<br /><br />Premise- Ex - Army quiet stud , underwear model type character ( well acted actually ) goes looking for the girl who sent him a Xmas card while serving in the military . Lands in with her cabin living - granola type family who are right - wing loggers . Family takes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chick to see he 's a better catch than her liberal looking , french wine drinking , porsche driving , loud cell phone talking , lazy , city slicking , Jewish looking fiancé.<br /><br />The Bad- 1d characters , 1d themes . Being beat over the head with the Pro - Military theme . Ed Asner.<br /><br />The Good- commercial breaks were long . Peter Jason . It ended .
0 This relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver 's license . It quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars.<br /><br />Such things as dune buggies , drag racing , custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed . It often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull , drawn out and even sexist at times . None of the people in the film are actually heard . Instead , everything is done in narration and voiceovers . Sorry , but I ca n't stand that.<br /><br />There is nothing educational or interesting about " Dad , Can I Borrow The Car ? " . It 's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their " Wonderful World Of Disney " TV show . 1/10
0 Definitely not worth the rental , but if you catch it on cable , you 'll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos -- Iman 's appearance is especially self - deprecating . It 's also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from The Sopranos typecast themselves .
0 Everything about this film was terrible . To start with this film had a pretty good cast and I find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever . The sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy . It had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating.<br /><br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLICT YOURSELF WITH THIS DISASTER YOU WILL ONLY BE HURT
0 Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws ? Orca is n't exactly a " Jaws rip off " but it is obvious that it tried to profit from Jaws 's success . First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie , not terrible but definitely not good , average at best.<br /><br />The plot is basically a male killer whale ( orca ) after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge . I could n't stand to watch this movie again . The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws it looks like the director , producers , and writers were almost talentless.<br /><br />As for the acting , it was very average and believable , however the actual characters are n't the least bit likable . The effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good.<br /><br />The violence is confusing , bloody , and not recommended for more sensitive people . The music is overdone and very loud , drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times . I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale ( killer whales do n't mate with only one mate as depicted in Orca).<br /><br />Overall this movie was bad / poor in my opinion , because of the reasons listed above . Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so I 'm not going to bash this movie and I can understand why some people may like it.<br /><br />My Rating : 3.5/10 ( but for its concept possibly a 5/10 )
0 Orca starts as crusty Irish sea captain Nolan ( Richard Harris ) & his crew are trying to capture a Great White Shark so they can sell it for big bucks , unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called Ken ( Robert Carradine ) comes under attack from it the Shark is killed by a Killer Whale , this raises Nolan 's interest in Killer Whales & decides he want 's to catch one of them instead . However while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female & injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess & enrages her mate , Nolan orders the Whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens . The male Killer Whale is annoyed to say the least & kills one of Nolan 's crew before they reach the dry land of Newfoundland in Canada , once there the Killer Whale conducts a series of attacks on the town & it 's people in an effort to lure Nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death ... <br /><br />Directed by Michael Anderson I thought this blatant rip - off was terrible , I 'm sorry but I thought it was just plain ridiculous & utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes . The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni & Sergio Donati is so stupid I 'm lost for words , the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously does n't help & if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whale 's are just one more time I 'll scream . I 'm sorry but I simply do n't believe a Killer Whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to & sink it , I do n't believe a Killer Whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there , I do n't believe a Killer Whale can identify someone 's house , know someone is in there & then wreck it on purpose , I do n't believe a Killer Whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat , I do n't believe Killer Whales can physically recognise people & I do n't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out . Maybe I 'm being a bit harsh , I mean it 's only a film after all but it 's a film which is trying to be serious & things just got so ridiculous that I was half expecting the Killer Whale to write a letter to Nolan to tell him his plan & hand ( or should that be fin ? ) deliver it , the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else . They should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold ! Seriously , that 's a statement that 's no more far fetched than anything else in this film . I found the film very boring , totally dull & had awful character 's with no on screen presence at all . It goes without saying this is a Jaws ( 1975 ) rip - off which does n't even come close to Spielberg 's classic.<br /><br />Director Anderson is no Spielberg that 's for sure , this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense , scares , tension or atmosphere at all . All the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater & totally forgettable , there 's no build up to them & virtually no pay off either as Orca does n't get to eat a single person . Then there 's the scenes which literally had me laughing , the shots of the Killer Whale appearing to cry are pure comedy & the opening scenes of the two Killer Whales I suspect tried to show them as a ' loving ' & ' caring ' couple but I could n't help but think that this is the closest we 'll ever get to Killer Whale porn , hilarious stuff . The footage of the Killer Whales themselves is bland & boring , instead of footage which matches & enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else . Do you get the impression that I do n't like this film ? Good . Forget about any gore or decent deaths either , there 's a brief scene when Bo Derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you 'll miss it.<br /><br />This probably had quite a big budget & it still sucks , there 's nothing outstanding about Orca , it 's well made I suppose but flat , bland & totally forgettable . The cinematography is quite nice though . The acting is bad , Rampling is awful & the late Harris ' Irish accent is embarrassing.<br /><br />Orca is a lame Jaws rip - off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made Spielberg 's film so good , this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere . Definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as Jaws : The Revenge ( 1987 ) .
0 ORCA is not exactly bad , but it 's not really Richard Harris 's finest hour either . As a demented , Ahab - like fisherman , Harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale 's " wife " and unborn child . Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris . She yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone . He does n't listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale . There are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale 's eye --- there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is . Bo Derek , as one of Harris 's crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the Orca and most of the supporting cast , including Robert Carridine , Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn do n't fare very well either .
0 I do n't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd . Orcas are most definitely not the cold - blooded killer this movie makes them out to be ... its silly . Orcas are extremely intelligent , do n't get me wrong , but I highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge . So I have to say all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was . So I was at least somewhat amused by it . Personally , I 'd recommend going and seeing Jaws if you 're wanting to see an Animal - Killing - Humans type of movie . But if you 're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then I 'd say go ahead . :D
0 Many have stated that Orca  Killer Whale is a Jaws rip - off . This is not really true , though the enormous commercial success of Jaws undoubtedly made these man .vs . beast stories more attractive propositions for film - makers in the second half of the ' 70s . Orca  Killer Whale would be better described as a modern - day retread of Moby Dick . It 's a story about obsession . On one hand a whale 's obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate ; on the other a bounty hunter 's obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives . Sadly , Orca- Killer Whale emerges a very disappointing film , its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting.<br /><br />Shark hunter Nolan ( Richard Harris ) encounters a marine - life researcher Rachel Bedford ( Charlotte Rampling ) diving off the Atlantic coast of Canada . Their meeting almost ends in disaster when Rachel 's team are attacked by a Great White Shark , but a Killer Whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark . After this , Nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a Killer Whale and selling it to an aquarium . But his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on . Rachel tells Nolan that a Killer Whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human . Worse still , native Umilak ( Will Sampson ) warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge . Nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident , but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that Nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it . Eventually Nolan is forced to pursue the Killer Whale   the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the Arctic Ocean , where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other.<br /><br />Two things stand out in this film . One is the haunting score by Ennio Morricone ( perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all - time , his talents wasted on various tenth - rate clunkers during the 70s and 80s ) . The other is the amazing widescreen photography of Ted Moore , which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye . In every other department , Orca  Killer Whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew . Harris appears extremely ill throughout the film , his hair bedraggled , black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale . His performance lacks the usual vitality . Rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long - winded and ill - informed explanations about the ways of whales . The rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles , the most memorable of which sees Bo Derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale . The plot is total nonsense from start to finish , with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery ! Although it 's credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions , the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd . Orca  Killer Whale is really one for completists of the man .vs . beast cycle from the late 70s . Most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair .
0 This film ca n't make up its mind whether its message is " humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless " or " do n't ever go in the water again . " A fisherman ( Nolan ) is out to nab a killer whale , a very bad thing , but when he accidentally ( ACCIDENTALLY mark you ) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate , the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho - bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself . ( I doubt it was her first . ) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self - inflicted wounds , her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt , kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan . Obviously as among humans , total psychos date other total psychos.<br /><br />The film reeks of half - thought out anti - human message , " the poor poor whale ! ! the evil men must suffer and die ! " and yet , it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all . It 's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel , but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and , as the film progresses , he grows more and more compassionate to the whale 's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale , just to make it feel a little better.<br /><br />The films final journey , in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north , reminds me of Melville 's eerie man - whale connection , and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion , where these two husbands might connect , understand even respect each other in their own grief , for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident . It 's clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss . However , it never goes there . The whale - character has no compassion or respect for anyone.<br /><br />The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws - like where the sea - monster finally kills everybody and Nolan and no - doubt through an oversight , fails to chomp up the whale - hugger ( tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier . ) I love animals , and I detest whaling , and what is more I love orca whales , but if this film 's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed . Nolan shows compassion and growth , and feels for others , and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming.<br /><br />The only message one can walk away with is " If you see an orca whale , ever , anywhere , run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way , he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you . "
0 Without a doubt , this is one of the worst pictures I ever actually paid money to see - the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie ! And that is exactly how I came to see this stink bomb ... <br /><br />At the distance of the better part of three decades I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line . Unbelievable plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is laughable . And that 's about all , except for a completely out - of - place " love theme " that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story . At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely ( in a two dimensional role ) but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery . He was no Captain Quint ( Robert Shaw ) and this is no " Jaws " . Mercifully , I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately . " Danger , Will Robinson ! " See the current t.v . commercial showing a husband and wife whale - watching ( " Orca - I love Orca ... " ) - at least it is over in sixty seconds . This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back .
0 While I do n't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life , I must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale ( and not even the mother ! ) having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans ! I mean , really ! This is basically the whole plot . Richard Harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk . This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it , you would feel like demanding your money back .
0 This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic , genre defining MASTERPIECE , Jaws . Yes , brainiac , great whites(and other species of shark , bull , black - tip , oceanic white - tip , tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found . Humans do n't often make it onto that menu , granted , but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior . It 's not like it 's never happened . The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town , singling out a human nemesis , sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people , all friends of the aforementioned " nemesis " , are close enough to the water for it to reach , are so slim as to be laughable . Much like this turd of a Jaws knock - off . Laughable . Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats , protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards , as they look like seals from below . A shark the size of Bruce(if you do n't know , look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca(hey ! that 's the name of the blatant rip - off we 're discussing ! ) , as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs . I could go on , but I do n't need to . Jaws is amazing(better acting , better effects , better music , better writing ) , Orca is crap(BLATANT rip - off of Jaws , lousy writing , abominable effects , most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick ) . It does n't take a masters from Columbia University to see that . Watch better movies .
0 I like monster movies , generally . Even if they are implausible and silly . But its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly AND tries to take itself seriously all at the same time . Like in a really posh kind of way.<br /><br />While the idea is somewhat factual , like Orcas are known for killing Great White Sharks , its really hard to find it scary when I ca n't help but just see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff . Especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the Orca 's doing ... and while it explodes , the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks . Plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they 're going to happen . On top of that , it takes a few jabs at JAWS . Its like " hey look , we 're being factual and we can come up with BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking".<br /><br />Yes you are , ignoring your outrageous * * * * ups in logic of course . But JAWS had one thing your movie does n't . Its scary . Yes its implausible . Yes its somewhat outrageous . But quite frankly , factual or not , a Killer Shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White . And the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more . Even JAWS the Revenge is scarier than this .
0 Please do not waste + /- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do n't . Especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you . Damn cheek if you ask me . I waited for something to happen - it never did . I am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through . I always have to see it through to the end . What a huge mistake . Do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining . Please do not waste + /- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do n't .

0 Fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart Orcas are but in the meanwhile ( and quite oblivious to them ) makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film . Richard Harris plays Quint .. I 'm sorry , that 's wrong , he plays Captain Nolan , a fisherman who catches sharks for a living , but is lured by the big catch , and tries to catch a killer whale . When the capture of a female killer whale goes awry ( do n't ask ) it 's mate ( do n't ask ) goes on a rampage ( do n't ask ) and starts STALKING Captain Nolan ( Do n't ask ) . Soon , Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common ( do n't ask ) . Pretty amazing film - making here folks . I got to tell you though , the beginning ( with the whale noises and nothing much else ) is pretty haunting and the end credits ( with the most godawful song ) is pretty entertaining .
0 Whale - hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br />A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail - fin . The whale 's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female 's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck . ' Captain Nolan ' ( Richard Harris ) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say , " Get out of town before high - tide . " < br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris ' presence and Bo 's beauty , but not much else . This was Bo 's first ' released ' film , though her first acting job was four years previous in ' And Once Upon a Love ' released in 1981 as ' Fantasies ' ( directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today , the date of this review ( November 20 ) , is Bo Derek 's birthday . I hope Bo has a ' whale ' of a good time ..... get it ? ..... whale ? ..... hee - hee .
0 I can fondly remember Bo Derek 's heyday and the UK press attention ( the mucky Sun & News of the World papers especially)- all following her small role in " 10 " with Dudley Moore . Understandably , much fuss was made of her photogenic face , crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts . < br /><br />Unfortunately , acting is , and never was , her forte ! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain DVD bins- Orca , Tarzan the Ape - man and Bolero . All these films could be nominated for the " So Bad They Are Great".<br /><br />It would be a guilty " must buy " of mine ! Should you ever read your press , or this comment Ms Derek , please do not be offended- ALways had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability . Much Love.x
0 OK . I know that the wanna - be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat , so the expectations for this film ran pretty low.<br /><br />Still , after sitting through this crap there 's one key thing I ca n't seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.<br /><br />The acting is awful , the characters boring and flat , the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult , and the rowing scenes unexciting , uneventful , and inaccurate.<br /><br />Unless you 've got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays ( or I guess , Rob Lowe ) fetish , there 's really no reason to see this one .
0 This is one of those movies which makes you think : would Hulk " The real American " Hogan have done the same ? Frankly I do n't think so and he 'd have been right . I 'm Italian , I can not go proud of my country for many reasons , but I would n't have rowed for another team ( The French , for example ) , simply because I 'm in love with Juliette Binoche . Besides the protagonist does n't fall in love desire with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman , so why rowing against Yale . As far as acting is concerned , well , all the players act very poorly . And then , you know , I hated that " Dead poets society " atmosphere . In fact that 's another movie I hate .
0 First off , to give you some idea of my taste in movies ... <br /><br />2007 Comedies I enjoyed : Superbad , Knocked Up , Hot Fuzz , Blades Of Glory < br /><br />2007 Comedies I hated : Evan Almighty , The Brothers Solomon , Good Luck Chuck < br /><br />I should have followed my first instinct and turned off " Hot Rod " after I got to about the 20 minute mark . I knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once . The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb . Any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective.<br /><br />This does n't come close to anything with Will Farrell and it 's clear that Andy Samberg ca n't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL . I do n't know how they roped Ian McShane and Isla Fisher into doing this movie ... they must have owed favors or something . I came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie , but I thought it would at least be funny . I did n't so much as smirk.<br /><br />I do n't normally comment on movies at IMDb , but this was so awful , I just had to warn people . This is only the 4th movie I 've seen that I 've felt compelled to rate 1/10 .
0 So i had low expectations for this movie to start with , but it failed to meet even those . while there were some funny parts , even one or two laugh out loud parts , this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good . the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly , leaving us sitting there going " WTF just happened ? " in addition , there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on . the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning . also , the editing was really lacking . there were some poor scene transitions , but that seems to be the style nowadays . It made me laugh , but i would n't watch it again , and I 'm very glad i waited for it to rent . give it a chance , you might enjoy it , but do n't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin , or Superbad .
0 This movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen . I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip - offs . Just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already . Make something new for once . All these new comedies are just horrible . And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead role yet . I hope he can bounce back from this awful movie . And Will Arnetts character is just plain bad . Hey Will , did you read the script . The plot is truly the worst ever written . Now you tell me if this is weird . ( this is the movie ) Rod Kimble 's step dad Frank is dying and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for the heart surgery so Rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for Frank . Only so that Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manliness . Yes that s the movie , you tell me , would u spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap!<br /><br />3/10 just horrible < br /><br />-adam
0 If i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have ! I see some ppl at IMDb says that this is the funniest movie of the year , etc etc excuse me ? are you ppl snorting LSD or ........ ? There is absolutely NOTHING funny about this movie N O T H I N G ! I actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap . < br /><br />I read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes , i totally understand that , i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once ! < br /><br />DO NOT watch this movie , do something else useful with your life do the dishes , walk the dog , hell ... anything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching hot rod .
0 Alright , friends , a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie , the bad as well as the good , and this movie put me to the test . I wo n't mince words . This movie was bad . The story was bad . The acting was bad . The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better . Indeed I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie ? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected would be bad ? The answer is , of course , that I am a movie buff and therefore can not avoid what otherwise should be avoided . I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie , except to say that the quality of the acting was , to put it politely , subpaar . A serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie . Otherwise . stay home , do n't waste your time , read a book , take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich .
0 I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd . It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as ' Hot ' Rod Kimble . He 's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father . When we meet him , he 's jumping a mail truck on his mo - ped , yes , a mo - ped , and almost makes it . This would be worthy of a ' Jackass ' movie if he was n't honestly trying to do this . Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl - next - door , Denise . She seems to like Rod enough to join his ' crew ' . Jorma Taccone ( also SNL ) plays his half brother , Kevin , who documents the stunts with a camcorder . Sissy Spacek plays Rod 's mom , Marie . She remarried Frank Powell , played by Ian McShane . Frank 's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls . It 's clear that Rod 's not going to earn Frank 's respect till he can beat him . We find out Frank needs a $ 50,000 . heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he ' can beat his ass ' once he 's healed , and prove himself a man . A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to ' go big ' on one stunt . Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life . Like the human torch- at a children 's birthday party . There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts . Just when all hope and money is lost , along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump . He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations . Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle . The whole town turns out and the world tunes in . Does he make the jump ? Does he get the girl ? Do they raise the $ 50k ? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod ? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out .
0 When viewing a movie as silly as ' Hot Rod , ' one must sit back , relax , and alter one 's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is , in this case , a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy . With a brief runtime of 88 minutes , this film was long past drawn - out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and were n't even funny in the first place . ' Hot Rod ' 's base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004 's cult hit ' Napoleon Dynamite , ' though it 's much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter . In fact , the movie 's blatant desperation to be compared to ' Napoleon Dynamite ' is scornful and offensive , and left me ticked off , instead of just being annoyed.<br /><br />The movie , if one were compelled enough to call it such , poses a paltry story that puts self - proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us , with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses ( one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped , so we 're told by Rod ) and raising $ 50,000 dollars for his stepfather 's impending life - saving heart operation ; all so that he can fight his stepfather , once recovered , and gain his respect   because in order to gain one 's respect , one must first fight them . Huh ? Whatever . Each character is no more interesting than Rod 's stick - on mustache , and from the film 's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion , each scene played like a nonsensical , and terribly unfunny , SNL skit  which , with the addition of an extra 85 minutes , is , essentially , what ' Hot Rod ' strives to be.<br /><br />The film 's star , Andy Samberg , contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip - drop of his comedic capabilities . Unfortunately  rather , realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five - year - old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee - pee gags . And if that 's disappointing , pull a chair , hide your face in your hands , and brace yourself for the real blow : he IS the film 's humor ! To rescue them of their mortification , I 'll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg 's co - stars ' roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team , director Akiva Schaffer , to his non - existent talent as a director   or a comedian . Basically , every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash - course comedy is perfectly portrayed here ; and done so arrogantly , as though the film would be funnier that way . Trick yourself into believing that there 's even a single laugh in this heap , or treat yourself to another movie  ANY other movie .
0 By no means is this movie as bad as ' Perfect Stranger ' , but it just was n't funny . It could n't stick to one type of comedy - it jumped from SNL , to Adam Sandler - esquire , to romantic , to little guy scores big , to slapstick , to ' Loser ' ( the movie ) types of comedies . Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments ( the fall down the hill ) , no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way . ' Schindler 's List ' was funnier ( and felt shorter ) . you never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school , a college dropout , or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek , in her worst choice of roles . And poor Ian McShane , THE serious actor if I only had to name one , is given crap to read into the camera . The story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end ( no spoilers here in case Adam Samberg 's mom wants to see it ) . Do n't spend ANY money going to see this movie , and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the hint and start producing quality ( Yes , Wayne 's World and Tommy Boy are quality ) movies .
0 Quite possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen ; I was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes . The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners . Do n't get me wrong , I love silly , stupid movies just as much as the next gal , but the whole premise , writing and humor stunk . It seemed to me that they were going for a " Napoleon Dynamite " feel - strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience . Instead , it ended up being forced , awkward and weird.<br /><br />The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt utterly awful that she ( and Sissy Spacek ) had signed up for this horrible thing.<br /><br />Thank gosh I did n't pay for it .
0 My family and I screened Underdog the night before . And as bad as Underdog is ( my four year old loved it ) , Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material . The only thing that could have saved this movie , was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie . I will admit however , that the soundtrack was good . I was n't sure if the movie was set in the 80 's , but with the majority of the music coming from Europe ? Who knows . If I were you , I would take a pass . And just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station . Or if you are dead set on watching this , people under the influence might enjoy it .
0 I 've seen a lot of crap in my day , but goodness , Hot Rod takes the cake . I saw a free screening in NY the other night . I can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers . The big laughs were sparse , the plot was uninteresting , and the characters were one dimensional at best . One highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg . It was priceless and was the only scene I truly had a hearty laugh at . Other than that , I can only recollect randomness and dead air . SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed . I know I was expecting more from it . But it short , I definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film .
0 SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded . It 's NOTHING like SNL , it 's just a stupid piece of crap.<br /><br />Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails . Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he 's funny.<br /><br />Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader . The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part.<br /><br />They could have made the " Quiet place " a lot better if they did n't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes.<br /><br />The part where he 's pronouncing his H 's more is retarded . They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts ... he 's a horrible actor and does n't deserve to be in a movie.<br /><br />This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy . Which is about half the United States .
0 Here 's one you can watch with a straight face , with a script so bad , even Will Ferrell would n't be in it.<br /><br />There are two laughs in HOT ROD.<br /><br />1 . The Punch - Dance . Rod " needs to go to his quiet place " and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon , he is footloosing a passionate , overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big - hair faux - metal chops of Europe.<br /><br />2 . John Farnham 's You 're The Voice . In one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support , the soundtrack is the gag . How did the film - makers even come across this Aussie recording artist ? A major Australian vocalist ( and a genuine talent ) who shot to fame in the early ' 70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin ' On My Head , then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You 're The Voice , John Farnham 's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy , it leveled mountains in Switzerland.<br /><br />Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else 's vomit.<br /><br />Andy Samberg is Rod , a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump . Maybe it 's got something to do with the fact he 's driving a moped into the heart of darkness . Or his fake mustache . Yeh , someone actually thought that was funny.<br /><br />Without one jump under his starry belt , he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian , like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever ... who watches these movies for plot anyway ? Along the way ( as usual for moronic leads in these comedies ) , he scores a salubrious chick ( Isla Fisher ) , who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek ( CARRIE , 1976 ) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up . Ian McShane must 've lost a bet to be here .
0 This was one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Horrible acting , Not funny at all , and well just boring.<br /><br />I can only assume all these 10 out of 10 fav . all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise.<br /><br />Idk what the runtime on this movie is I 'm sure its listed on this page It certainly felt like an eternity < br /><br />If your looking for a tough challenge , attempt to sit through this awful movie.<br /><br />otherwise < br /><br />Don't waste your time as I did on this one
0 After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside , you 're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy . Then the movie takes a turn for the worse . < br /><br />The warm feeling might still be there , but as others has said : The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it 's almost unbearable to watch . < br /><br />The movie gets sped up , and you get the impression that you 're either fast forwarding through it , or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40 m and had to cut a lot of scenes out.<br /><br />Realism is n't a goal onto itself , but as a viewer , I 'm pretty convinced that this comedy is n't intentionally unrealistic , it just happens to be.<br /><br />On the plus side , this movie has a couple of nice interiors , and despite the bad script , I think that the actors performances are mainly good . If I could rate the first 25 minutes only , I 'd probably give it an eight . As it is now , it gets a four . ... And that 's being nice ! < br /><br />If you 're a sucker for romantic comedies you 'll probably have a great time anyways . If not , I 'd recommend that you watch something else .
0 Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen - and I mean ever . My wife and I were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes . Not to mention being boring , it is entirely unbelievable . Women ( non - lesbian ) do n't bathe together - nor do they " accidentally " kiss . Brothers and sisters do n't live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park . Men do n't find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife . Absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in films today . She smiles when she should be crying and vice versa . The only movie she has ever been good in is Boogie Nights - and that is because she was n't acting.<br /><br />I can not stress enough how bad this movie was .
0 It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience , to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most . However , this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ) . Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles . This film might have been more , as there was suitable budget for settings , actors and a decent story line . My wife and I both agreed that this was ' Muck ' at the end , as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high ! Better luck next time , hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell .
0 If there has ever been a worse comedy than ' Gray Matters ' I am unaware of it . The New York Jewish comedy 's ' funny ' premise is that siblings Sam & Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend , only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target - Charlie . The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her . There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence , a deeply embarrassing ' drunk act ' from Moynahan and Graham , and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh . Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume . Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance . Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under - employed and given nothing with which to work . The whole disaster is cemented by Graham 's bizarre eye - rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar . It is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs .
0 Sam ( Thomas Cavanagh ) and Gray ( Heather Graham ) are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things -- ballroom dancing , 1940s movie musicals and , much to their surprise , an attractive woman named Charlie ( Bridget Moynahan ) . Historically heterosexual , Gray is confused by her new feelings.<br /><br />Gray Matters proves to be one of the blandest films I have ever seen . It 's dull , predictable , unfunny , poorly acted and poorly written . Nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy . Also , this is n't really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a " coming out " movie . Sue Kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part . Unfortunately , she failed miserably . The first half was largely unfunny and only Heather Graham was able to hold it up a little . Then , the film took an awkward tone and got all serious . The serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony.<br /><br />I guess I would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic . The brother and sister relationship was very weak and they did n't really appear to be that close . Their relationship just did n't feel very natural . Also , the relationship between Tom and Bridget felt very unnatural . If two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week , then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in Vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are . There was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters.<br /><br />The acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast . Heather Graham gave the only good performance in the movie . She was funny and had a few charming scenes but it 's too bad that all of her co - stars were complete duds . Bridget Moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level . Also , it seemed like she was reading her lines . Thomas Cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion . The chemistry between Thomas and Heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony . I can usually rely on Molly Shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying . Sissy Spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them . Finally , Alan Cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance was n't very good . Overall , Gray Matters is a lame film and it is n't worth watching . Rating 3/10
0 I had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end ... having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom . What really horrifies me , I mean truly disturbs me , is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as ' delightful ' or a ' must see . ' I would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants.<br /><br />The truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten . It is decidedly unfunny , poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold , canned rice pudding . To be kind to Ms Kramer , the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity , for having read the synopsis before I watched it , I had expected something more challenging . The possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co - dependence , the unexpected awakening of ' sisterly ' sexuality , and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry ( for the affections of the same girl ) were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration , yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from.<br /><br />Instead , the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations , with clichéd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction . The lack of directorial control seems astounding ; on the one hand , Moynahan , Cavanagh and Spacek all give very pedestrian performances , while Heather Graham and Molly Shannon - the latter in particular - veer towards embarrassing over - compensation at times . One could lay the blame for this on the director - maybe Sue Kramer hopes that if her actors over - act , they will force a bigger laugh from the audience . But then again , the cast is a veteran one ; one would expect them to do better.<br /><br />Sue Kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make , and for whom . Given the possible issues Gray Matters alludes to , and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy , perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead . I know it is never easy to make films about women and women 's issues , especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone , but whatever direction she takes , inconsequential and flimsy characters like Gray are not going to cut mustard .
0 I wish I 'd known more about this movie when I rented it . I 'd put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress ( IMHO ) . While parts of the movie were charming , much of the movie felt contrived , undeveloped , or otherwise just boring or predictable . Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple ... I do n't care how big a part of the story line that is , it still felt a bit , um , gross . And Charlie , for a zoologist , she certainly does n't seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens . What was it about her ( besides her hotness and some common interests ) that made Gray fall for her ? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth . High points - Molly Shannon ( although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion ) , the cabbie in drag , and the dance sequences ( if Sam & Gray were such great dancers , I wish we 'd seen more of that , as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie ) . Could have been better .
0 This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year . You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here , there are SPOILERS . Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin ( Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh ) . Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister ; living together in everyone else 's eyes as man and wife . No sex but just about everything else . Early on , the movie starts with its theme : ' the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions ' . Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch . Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him , she does it and gets to the nitty - gritty questions too . When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date . Charlie ( Bridget Moynahan ) is the girl of THEIR dreams , like all the right things etc   Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal ! That Charlie accepts ! In one week Charlie , Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas . In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns ( apparently Charlie has an off - the - rack figure ) . Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $ 10,000 frock for her . While Charlie is zipping her in this ' down - payment - on - a - house ' gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte ( I swear it was like a feed bag ) . What should happen but ' woops ! ' latte all over the gown . It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale 's bridal salon with out a $ 10,000 mocha colored gown . Back to ' reality '  Caesar 's palace Las Vegas . They have the ' high roller room ' ( Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money ? ) Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink - a - thon were , you guessed it - they kiss . Gray remembers everything ; Charlie remembers nada . They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line " If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds " Gray gets the hiccups . Gray excuses herself , for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again ' hiccups ' . Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets , literally . And of course one is you guessed it again ! Gay . The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver ( Alan Cummings ) named Gordy . He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned . They become great friends . This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss . He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment . When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office . Gray works at an ad agency . This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone . It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency . Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not - so - private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office . This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew : Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar . ' Sorry no men ' says the bouncer . So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag . Bad drag . He was in a sleeveless black satin - like blouse , a string of pearls , and a grandma 's church hat . No lesbian would ever confuse this ' man in a dress ' as a drag queen much less a woman . The bar was also the straight man 's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is : full of Victoria 's Secret models . Everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firm 's client . Gray happens to be on the woman 's account and finally does more then kiss . For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray , but that is for the sequel .
0 The first half of this movie is a pure delight . Novel . Funny . Wonderful performances . A close knit brother and sister living in Manhattan fall for the same woman ! Adult . Bright . Witty . What more could you ask . As a romantic comedy this starts refreshing . It heads into unexplored territory . And then it falls apart.<br /><br />It goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming - of - age coming - out - of - the - closet story that has been done many times before . What a disappointment . As a people film it begins with such promise . Why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian " I am who I am " film . The freeze - frame ending shot of Heather Graham 's jumping in the air to celebrate " her happiness at finding herself " underlines the banality of the last part of the film.<br /><br />It could have been different . It could have been magical . It ended up being the same old same old .
0 I watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed.<br /><br />Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours ( or however long it actually was ) . From the beginning , every single element of this movie is unbelievable . This movie made me chuckle several times , but they were mainly out of shock that the director / writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together.<br /><br />The movie 's focus is Gray ( Graham ) and her issues with intimacy . Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much in common.<br /><br />Interesting , intriguing . However , instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable , the director keeps taking Gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all . Being an LGBT individual , this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming - out process . ( I 'll be insulted if the writer 's queer . ) Had it not been for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham ( which , by the way , was understandably forced ) , I would give it a negative 3 stars .
0 It is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any " gray matters " will agree that this movie just does n't work.<br /><br />The problems lay in the direction , cast selections and lack of depth in the character building . The word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used . Let 's look at the problems in direction / script.<br /><br />Brother and sister both in their mid 30 's seem to be well adjusted . They meet a complete stranger at a park and Heather Graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer . He then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him . Then after ONE date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a week 's time ? ? ? ? Hello does anyone feel stupid yet ? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that WE see on the screen and he wants to marry her . Not only was there no chemistry it just does n't make sense . Sure it 's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could , but the direction made it completely flat.<br /><br />Now Heather falls head over heels with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan ( very shallow character ) kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry MIGHT be there . I found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say Heather can not act i think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role . < br /><br />This was Sue Kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew . It would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and IMHO it could be done with better writers and casting and direction .
0 Okay , let me coin a new word here : polyphobia : The fear of polyamorous relationships . This is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome , only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution . Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person , and this director is not one of them . Bleh.<br /><br />Mark my words : a few decades from now , polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux - pas as homophobia , but guess who was too close - minded to realize this ? Right the first time : the producers of this movie . And so many like it . Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old - fashioned type of movie like this ? Priding itself on being limitlessly open - minded about gayness , it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy , which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory . Open your eyes , people , please!<br /><br />This is a disappointing , run - of - the - mill chick - flick . ( But , damn , I got ta say , Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive.)<br /><br />3 out of 10 .
0 Wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen ! ! This person should never make another movie!!I ca nt believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience . YOu have have wasted every cent . No concept of real life . I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back . EVER ! ! ! Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm embarrassed for them ! All of you should be ashamed . If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years . Please never watch this movie . I have never written a blogg about a film before but The distaste for this film has compelled me to do so .
0 OH MY GOD .. THE WORST SH*T I'VE EVER SEEN -this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie . And I really do not understand anybody with opposite myth . Though , maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable . I especially mean the role of H. Graham . What was that ? ? ? In my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers . The character was played in affected and annoying way . Every time she appears it reminds that you ' re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment , then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion . TERRIBLE , do n't waste your time .
0 I do n't know who Sue Kramer , the director of this film is , but I have a strong suspicion that A ) she is a lesbian and B ) she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic.<br /><br />I can imagine everyone thinking , " My God , this is horrible . Not funny . Pedestrian . Totally lame . " But keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti - gay or they " do n't get " the gay lifestyle . ( This is probably why Kramer did NOT cast gay people to play gay people too . ) Anyway , it 's not even worth reviewing . The actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do . It 's full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funny.<br /><br />I hated it and I 'm not afraid to say so . Too bad the gutless people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb were n't as unbiased in their judgment .
0 Heather Graham could n't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it . Who do the producers of the movie think they are ? the ABSOLUTE WORST , most UNREALISTIC movie i 've seen in as long as i can remember . This movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign - up on IMDb and make sure the rating of this " film " drops.<br /><br />omg i 'm Heather Graham , i just kissed a drunk chick , so while she 's passed out i 'm REALLY going to pace around my room for HOURS asking myself frantically " WHAT HAVE I DONE ? ! " .. Jesus heather , get over it and grow up ... and i 'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers ... and while i 'm at it , instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story , perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who 's mentally unstable ... like your so - called " lesbian " character ... after all , i know the first time i had gay sex , when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b*tch , get a grip ... < br /><br />WHAT A JOKE ! and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick , but i 'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore . bottom line , if you 're a smart person you 'll hate this movie , and if you 're not a smart person , then you 'll love it ... it 's as simple as that .
0 I do n't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it . Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about . Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline . Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner . Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song . Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s . Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole . Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out . I do n't know what it was that made me hate it so , but if it means trying to watch it again I 'm not willing to find out .
0 I noticed " Fire " was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I could n't recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in ' 85 . Twenty years later the film is still awful . Besides the synthesizer , the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s , as is evident in the title song . Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them . And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowe 's character played saxophone , and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker , only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo . All the characters were intensely unappealing , although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them . Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing , and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear , but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe 's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon .
0 What happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is ? Just one year after " The Breakfast Club " , a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in " St. Elmo 's Fire " ( who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles.<br /><br />Was it the directing or the writing . Since it was the same person ( Joel Schumacher ) it must be both . But then Schumacher has since given us " The Phantom of the Opera " , " Phone Booth " , " A Time to Kill " , and two Batman movies , " Batman and Robin " and " Batman Forever " which range from good to great directing . Something went wrong on " StEF " because it has no genius whatsoever , no comedy worth anything , and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life . < br /><br />Example : The character Wendy ( a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by Mare Winningham ) reveals to Billy ( an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends , drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by Rob Lowe ) that she is still a virgin . Billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but Wendy " is not ready " . Wendy , in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends . Later in the story , when Billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together . Billy is leaving for New York , deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter , he convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect " going away gift " from her to him . And Wendy , who works as a social worker helping broken families , seems not to be phased at all by this despot . Give me a break . The one thing she can only give once , she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends ? Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment.<br /><br />Many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue.<br /><br />I suppose some may say that " that was the 80 's " but I remember it was in the " 80 's " that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out.<br /><br />I think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right.<br /><br />As for the technique ( not the story ) , it was terrible as well . It is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes . Transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense . Pick up what is on the editing room floor , put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better ... but it still is a horrible movie.<br /><br />Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 ( he must have ) or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for St Elmo 's Fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way - that is what I really think happened .
0 I saw this in the theater when it came out , and just yesterday I saw it again on cable . This I was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is . The whole bunch of characters are self - absorbed narcisstic preeners . Worst of all , it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20-something dating , even as it purports to celebrate people " finding themselves " . The nice guys finish last , the jerky guys make out great , the jerkiest guys do best . The girls are all boy toy pushovers . Only one character ( " Wendy " ) is seen doing anything remotely useful to society , and she dispenses with her long - saved virginity in a throwaway one - night stand with a scumbag , in a lushly filmed scene that we 're supposed to think is romantic . What this really is is Hollywood 's concept of young America : permissive , detached , promiscuous , conceited .
0 I 'll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie- guess I did n't approach it with the proper dewy - eyed nostalgia of the generation before me . But suffice it to say- St Elmo 's Fire was pretty crap - freaking- tastic , even as far as Brat Pack films go.<br /><br />Here is yet another lovely example of the smug , self - indulgent neurosis that is everything 80s ( RENT , anyone ? ) The plot is virtually non- existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best , poorly delivered the rest of the time . The complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters does n't help the situation . There really was no growth , no forward movement at all . Even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in . < br /><br />Each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest , most predictable way possible . The Stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a Stalker and Andie MacDowell is gorgeous . The Jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is , well , a jackass . The Gorgeous Slut hides really soulful , deep pain with a wild lifestyle . The Poet moods and mopes around for a full 3/4 of the film until he can reveal ( ! ) he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows . The Virgin finally becomes a whole , happy human being after getting every Virgin 's desire of one hot roll in the sack with a Jackass before he ditches her to really change ( for real this time ) . The Cheating Bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught . And finally The Feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters " commitment".<br /><br />Which brings me to my final beef- what bond of super - cement was holding these people together as friends ? I ca n't imagine being with just one of them- Now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar . And they were all so terrible to each other- heads in toilets , near rape , and sleeping around with everrrryone . The cherry was after two BFFs act like total baboons after screwing the Feminist , she 's like , " umm , actually I do n't want to be with either of you anymore . Let 's be friends ! And we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that I may hook up with one or the other at any given point , but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment ( NOT THAT WORD ! ) . " And they all smile as if to say , " Golly gee , I never thought of that ! What a great idea!" < br /><br />Only it 's not . Kinda in the way that watching this movie is not .
0 St. Elmo 's Fire has no bearing on life after university at all ( for the majority of us common folk anyway ) . Why was this garbage even made ? Who can really relate to this ? Who lives like these characters ? I truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script . There are some talented young actors in this " film " that have done a good job elsewhere . It must have just been one whole joke to them on set.<br /><br />I actually found this " film " insulting to my intelligence . The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy 80 's films . It really is that offensive to the genre .
0 I think I 've seen this sort of thing before : college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good , all the while , complaining that their lives suck.<br /><br />This movie is highly derivative of The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can make of it : they practically have the same plot.<br /><br />If anything good came out of this snore - fest , it was the music . That was it.<br /><br />As far as I 'm concerned , I 'm not impressed ... but then again , I never expected anything less . This movie was directed by the same person that directed Batman and Robin ; another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow.<br /><br />Now for the verdict : it 's a 1 out of 10 .
0 Joel Schumaker directs the script he co - wrote and has a group of Georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations . The story line is a scrambled mess , but some scenes are actually good . There is a lot of wasted talent and time here . The cast is more impressive than the movie . Featured are Demi Moore , Rob Lowe , Judd Nelson , Andrew McCarthy , Emilio Estevez , Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham . The most notable being McCarthy and Moore . Lowe is quite obnoxious . Coming of age is not so damn easy .
0 The youthful group in " St. Elmo 's Fire " who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university . For the most part , these kids are irresponsible , selfish , greedy and stupid , yet co - writer and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation . With a now - outdated cast of " up and comers " , a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of " Terms Of Endearment " , and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us , " Fire " is a paltry blaze , one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 The fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in Switzerland 's film history makes me shake my head ! It 's true , but pitiful at the same time . A flick about the Swiss army could be a good deal better.<br /><br />The story sounds interesting , at the beginning : Antonio Carrera ( Michael Koch ) gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church , wedding his love Laura Moretti ( Mia Aegerter).<br /><br />The Acting in some way does n't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality . Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre , personally i found her rather annoying . < br /><br />The storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance , which does not work as expected . The romance - part is too trashy , and the comedy - part is not funny at all , it 's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever . It 's funny for preadolescent 12 - 13 year olds , but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy . The humor is weak except for some shots.<br /><br />Dope ? Cool ! Stealing ? Cool ! If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS , make sure you did not absolve your military training yet , and even then do n't expect too much!<br /><br />I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars , because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time . Not a hell of a lot screen time though
0 Well , AWFUL is just the first name . This movie is a cliché - ridden piece of junk . A high school comedy setup in a military training camp . I 'm sorry I had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve.<br /><br />THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:<br /><br />Just about everything is totally forced , unconvincing and unrealistic . The HEPO ( military police ) will not come to get you if you do n't make your appearance , especially not on your wedding day . The actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene , because the scene did n't work as it was so highly unlikely . You can sense it in their voices . Even if they were not such bad actors , they would n't have been able to save the scene . < br /><br />Next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit . No , there was no time to get him an uniform first . Man , this is great cinematography ! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life.<br /><br />There are also GIRLS in the camp -- exciting -- one of'em even a model , though not looking that great -- and the baddest actress I 've ever seen . I doubt in Hollywood they would let her say a single line in a B movie . < br /><br />Okay girls in the military ! Now this is getting fun . The girls are even placed on the same floor , so we can sneak to their room at night ! In reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away , separated by two fences with barbed wire . < br /><br />There are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time , of which we have plenty . No , the tanks are not locked , and the ignition keys are inserted . No one will notice the engine sounds , especially not at night.<br /><br />There is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line . We need those so the sexually obsessed Germans will like the movie as well . Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film . Well done!<br /><br />One sex scene takes place in the kitchen . Surely , none of those facilities are ever locked . The military routines are as sloppy as they can get.<br /><br />In the end of the brainless flick , the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him ! Because he deserted his fiancée ! Sure I buy that , the Italians are that way -- a jealous bunch ( not ) . < br /><br />The bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses . Not at night in a dark alley . Again , military training grounds ( where there is shooting with live ammo ) are open to the public , anyone can freely drive or walk in there . There are no such things as guards or fences . < br /><br />The deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the Italians ' car . The explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiancée off their feet . No one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens . It 's a COMEDY , remember.<br /><br />Okay . It 's a comedy , I got that , and I can live with that . No realism needed . Filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously , side splitting funny , or entertaining , interesting , challenging . Unfortunately it is none of those . It 's just embarrassing . A rip - off from brainless American comedies . The latter are at least done professionally , with no amateur actors.<br /><br />It is pretty boring and predictable , a waste of time and energy , especially to those sitting through the entire movie as I unfortunately did . Yawn .
0 This film makes " American Pie " a sophisticated movie ! No further comment needed . Humor is cheap , dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward . Every cliché is used several times without any original twist . And far the worst , the movie turns out to be more catholic than the Pope . It 's so sad .
0 Seriously - avoid this movie at any cost . I just saw it in my first " sneak preview " ever and although I paid non - refundable money for it , I walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes . Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave . First time EVER I walked out of a movie . And I lived through some pretty bad ones.<br /><br />It 's one of those films that is dubbed ( and badly so ) even though it is shown in its original language . It relies on the oldest , simplest and cheapest jokes in the book . On the military ( " What do we do once we reach the fighting zone ? " - " You get out of the car and die " ; actually , it 's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film ) , on drugs ( a guy eats some " space cookies " , behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high - all badly written and acted ) , on women in the army ( " Why do we only get trumpets ? We were promised guns ! " - " That 's the way it is , that 's the way it 'll stay " ) ... Argh . Okay , you might actually find these genuinely funny , but in that case you seriously scare me.<br /><br />Additionally , I have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on European late night TV . So it had lame jokes ( delivered badly ) , beyond lower average acting , lacked pace , was badly dubbed and edited  It just did n't work . At least not on any level used as a measure for films.<br /><br />I would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee Germans . And that 's saying something if you like stereotypes . ( Which I do n't , it 's nice to play with them , though . Just in case somebody thinks I 'm not being PC enough.)<br /><br />Instead of going to see this film , do something useful . Try to teach crocheting to prawns , paint your toenails in a really irritating colour , disassemble your bicycle , change some light bulbs , try to understand Einstein 's theories , convert to a different religion and back - in fact , go and listen to " Last Christmas " by Wham ! on endless repeat . Anything , but do n't watch this awful flick .
0 This film is so bad , you ca n't imagine . The acting is terrible , even worse than in third class soap operas . An it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland . The interactions between the soldiers did n't make any sense at all . The story could have been taken out from a bravo photo - story , the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy . But nowadays it does n't need much to satisfy the audience . The actors were handsome for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung ( woah ! ! ) and there certainly was much abuse of drugs . That 's real cool man ! Particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens . But the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you do n't go along with the other ` sheep ' and say.yes that is exactly what it was like when I was in the army/ that 's exactly what I 'm going to do when I must go to the army .. to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness . And do n't think I like the army . I was there and I hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush ( which I was forced to do because I offended an lieutenant ) It is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated . Sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and I think its not a bad thing . But this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots . But since I now that my opinion is n't very popular I will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your wits!<br /><br />2/10<br /><br />(sorry for my bad English )
