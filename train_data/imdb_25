0 The story line has been rehashed a number of times ; " a breath of life in the retirement home " . Several plays , movies , novels , short stories , poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end , but it 's still an excellent platform for character studies.<br /><br />If ' Gideon ' was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant , but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches ( even the subtitle and summary of Gideon 's " simple wisdom " almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness ) . Mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film , but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors ' lack of focus almost irrelevant .
0 Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON . This movie could have been a classic had Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump , or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN , or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM.<br /><br />Too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life , the supporting performances by Charlton Heston , Carroll O'Connor , Shirley Jones , Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excelent . 3 of 10 .
0 Really started the 80s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a " horror film " . I was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and I was disgusted then as now.<br /><br />Oh , where do we start . Let 's see , the setup : You can bring people back to live IF they died a violent death . So that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways , because , well , that 's needed to bring them back to life ! This might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la Re - Animator or something . But no , it 's played straight . There is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down , one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen . However , just about everything else is on screen . There is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople , who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras . Then , there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly -- and time consumingly -- reveal in time - lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look " normal " again . This done , of course , by a slumming Jack Albertson as the mortician behind it all . He likes to drive around in a ambulance / hearse playing old Tommy Dorcey tunes , I guess that is supposed to be cute.<br /><br />In the end , of course , even the Sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands . Not clear why the Sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off , sticking needles in burn - victims eyes , etc.<br /><br />I wonder , really wonder , what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all . It 's not scary , the twists are laughable , and overall it 's kind of sick . It 's not even well enough done to " see it on a dare " or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad HG Lewis film . It 's just God - awful trash , made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore , and made by people slumming for a paycheck.<br /><br />Sad that Albertson was even involved .
0 This was just plain terrible . I read this book for school , i made As on all of the tests , and to see it like this ! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it , and it was worse than Leonard Part 6 , Plan 9 from Outer Space , and Hudson Hawk put together . The thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over . First of all , it was made on Hallmark . Second , the acting was terrible . Third , it was like completely different from the book . Literally , it was so bad I asked myself to be excused . Basically , I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this . Take my advice , do n't watch this film . No one would want to watch this . It was horrible . HORRIBLE !
0 This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie . Jacob Have I Loved is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen . There is no storyline , plots disappear , and the editing is awful . To top it all off , the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible . Bridget Fonda 's acting is decent , but everyone else 's acting is totally amateur . I would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut - scenes , bad transitions and acting that should have been re - shot ! Read the book and do n't waste your time with this film .
0 But I got over it . To me , it seemed that even the Author of the book favored Caroline . I felt so sorry for the character Louise , and she was constantly compared with Esau who was evil , I just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un - realistic . Really though , the movie was bad . I would n't really see it unless you 're ready for a big let down .
0 I had to watch this in school . And to sum it up ... <br /><br />Talentless actors , talentless script , and a talentless director.<br /><br />This movie is such a waste of your time . Do n't even watch the movie . Do n't bother . You will be so disappointed . My teacher said it was supposed to be good . How wrong she was . She even slept through it a little . The movie 's actors were just bad . The best actor in there was the old man and that 's not saying much . It 's has horrible plot with awful characters . So unrealistic and I can honestly said it had no point . The script was unemotional and confusing . There was points in the movie when I furrowed my brows and said , " What ? " . Also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes . It was just absolutely horrendous .
0 It 's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece . I am not a dullard as far as quality films go , and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint , as well as for several of the characters portrayed , the film is in an award - worthy class . But there is no sense ( for me ) of this film actually going anywhere ; I mean , taking the viewer anywhere . It is a series of mood scenes , perhaps remarkable as such , but I want more from a film . I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival , none of which did I find in this film . Yes , it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that I can not live with for the same reason : that it paints pictures without going anywhere.<br /><br />One thing further to be said is that it documents a mid - century English childhood , which is necessarily limited in its universality . I was personally appalled at what a young British boy had to live through , in that time and place . Having grown up in America just a decade earlier , I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense . I can not help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably . In other words , could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its ' filmic magic ' ( which I acknowledge is there ) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one 's actual recalled experience ?
0 i love horror films , low budget , 50 's , 60 's , 70 's , 80 's .. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film ? let 's compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films . the haunting , the changeling , the shining . or for a similar technology based horror film that was FAAAR better , ( though still FAR from great ) Demon Seed . OK , i 'll be fair .. let 's compare it to made - for - TV horror films ! do n't go to sleep .. waaay creepier and better done . salem 's lot , the night stalker , night gallery , even do n't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better . * SPOILERS * first of all , for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was , you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy ! the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers ! TERRIBLE . also , just what we understand about the house .. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on , and it 's a very emotional house . not a spirit , or demon , or entity , it 's a house that s " possessed " , but by what ? we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie / margaret , our protagonist ? now that I 'm on the topic of suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me , this poor old crazy lady comes , tells you she was your nurse , pours her heart out , falls in the boiling pool , struggling in agony for 45 seconds , and what does margaret do ? does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her 's life ? no , she stands there and watches ! the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film , but that 's where the positives end . for at least a more interesting , and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed : the bed that eats . i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either have n't watched it since it originally aired , or remembered it scaring them as children . this film was pretty much merit less .
0 Exactly what you would expect from a B - Movie . Deritive , gratuitous nudity , boring in parts , ridiculous gore and cheesy special - effects . Of course it could have been better , better acted ( defintly ) better written , directed , etc . But then I guess it would n't have been a B movie . The actors pretty much sucked , in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood , profanity and nudity.<br /><br />Tiffany Shepis must be singled out . She absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium . Not that acting really matters in these movies , but she was better than any of the other actors . She 's also smokin hot , in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie - wow ! Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit , I mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out . And near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked.<br /><br />So if your a looser b - movie horror buff ( like myself ) , check this out . If not , you should probably avoid at all costs .
0 The script was VERY weak w/o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them . The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced . The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you do n't have to listen to them talk this very muted , stiff dialogue . On a technical note , the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times . Then again , this could be called a blessing . Overall , this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minutes . The obvious " in your face " homages to Sam Raimi and " Evil Dead " would have been good had they been more subtle , but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off . C'mon , this kind of 35 mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done ? Still , the cinematography , lighting design and shots were very well done indeed .
0 The Hazing is confused mumbo - jumbo that wants so hard to be The Evil Dead that it even references Bruce Campbell several times . The problem is , it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie . This movie is nowhere near as original . The plot has been used before , by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons , and that was a lot more fun . This flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings.<br /><br />Brad Dourif is , as usual , not given much to do here , but when he is on screen he puts in another over - the - top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous . As for the acting of the kids , it 's passable but by no means good . The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric . There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims , but it was never scary for a second . The gore level is mid - range to low , but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times . All in all , just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste .
0 i can not believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was I wrong . The plot was abysmal , the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful . Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess . However i can not lie , some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the Asian boy says '' i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f * * * * stereotypes ' ' < br /><br />please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh .. maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
0 I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke ( as Jill ) , who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show , in her first feature film . I was hoping to see more of her , but thought she did very well acting her role . Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host , and model , it was not surprising . I was left wondering why she was killed , and what happened as a result . Maybe I just missed it.<br /><br />I was n't really sure about the genre of this movie , and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience . I tried to keep an open mind considering horror was n't my favorite genre , but felt like I had outgrown the gags . It seemed to drag out in some places , leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had , and , like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Having written a couple of scripts , I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions , how many movies you have seen & studied , and those you relate with at a point in time.<br /><br />In a nutshell , I found it interesting , but not a satisfying plot and ending for me . If Jill ( Brooke Burke ) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone 's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating .
0 This was truly dreadful ! It had a terrible storyline , was poorly acted , and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good.<br /><br />It took all my tenacity to make it through this one , it 's a good job I did n't have to visit the toilet else I doubt I would have come back ! This one makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big screen Hollywood epic . < br /><br />The only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women . Not a bad one among them ! < br /><br />If you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one 's for you ... else avoid it like the plague !
0 The master of cheap erotic horror , Rolfe Kanefsky , finally makes a movie that does n't go straight to the Playboy Channel . " The Hazing " borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead , but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable ... just barely . The characters are cardboard , the dialogue is wooden , the story is paper - thin and the actors could n't act their way out of a grocery bag . Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie . Sometimes , when I 'm bored , I like to eat paper . Watching this movie is a lot like that . Chew on it for 90 minutes and you 're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value .
0 Not exactly a new story line , but this romantic comedy makes the concept work . A young man(John Cusack ) and a drop dead gorgeous woman(Kate Beckinsale)keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other . Although both are promised to others ... oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere . A little sappy in some places , but viva la love . Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted . My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling . The finale is almost too sweet , but most deserving . This is not one of Cusack 's deeper roles , but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale . Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon . John Corbett plays the worst role I 've ever seen him in . On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny . Watch this with your soul mate .
0 Oh , for crying out loud , this has got to be the LAMEST movie I 've seen all year , and I 'm sorry the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless , twitty piece of Stupidity . Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message , albeit on a more subtle , somewhat more mature level , Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer , and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so ( and that 's an hour and a half of my life I 'll never get back again , thank you very much ! ! ) . It 's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen - year - olds ( actually I 've known better fourteen - year - olds ... ) , except maybe for Jeremy Piven , who was enjoyable enough . Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale 's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind ( literally ) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief . I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence , and at least , the characters in Rockstar were n't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this " Serendipitous " mess . It 's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives , and feel they 're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate . How utterly tiresome . I 'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who 'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences . After all , here 's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people 's lives ( namely their respective fiancées ) , not to mention other relatives and friends , just to get there.<br /><br / >
0 Wow , I ca n't believe people consider this a ' good ' movie . Now , I have seen much worse , but there are much more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack.<br /><br />This is a mediocre film at best . While the acting was n't terrible , but not great , for a romantic comedy , there was little passion , little romance . There were many loose ends that do n't show up or are not addressed . Unfortunately , the main characters do come off as complete cowards . They do n't know themselves well enough to realize that they do n't love the people they are engaged to . How do we know they are n't in love ? By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances . I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.<br /><br />The movie does n't even end with a wedding scene , more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing . This movie is really about two people who ca n't commit to anything , unlike Cusack 's previous characters , who were more than willing to make a deep commitment ( Loyd in Say Anything , Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank , etc.).<br /><br />The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns , or anything of interest . When the movie ended , I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story , which basically fits the whole movie : boring . No suspense about whether the two will end up together , no joy when they do , no consequences to their actions.<br /><br />It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie , that they simply rebuke any criticism with ' Everyone is too Cynical ! ' . Criticism of this movie is not cynicism , simply unbiased examination . There are many other better romantic comedies , even ones with Grace Kelly , or Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />If you think this movie is great , try these movies , you hearts will explode : The Princess Bride , Say Anything , Grosse Pointe Blank , High Fidelity , Keeping the Faith , Charade , Rear Window , North by Northwest , or There 's Something About Mary ( which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today 's society ) .
0 For years I remember reading about this show " Trouble With Tracy " in the TV Guide . CFTO - TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am ! I lived about a two - hour drive north of Toronto and we could n't get CFTO , but you know how it is - we always want what we ca n't have.<br /><br />Well , I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this " Trouble With Tracy " was all about . Did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role ? Was there nudity ? Was there suspense ? Was it a comedy ? It would 've been fine if there was some promotion of the show . At least I could 've known what I was missing . But , NO ! The mystery drove me bonkers , until CTV affiliate CKCO built a re - transmitter in Wiarton , Ontario and began to broadcast " Trouble With Tracy " at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday mornings at 6 am ! ! One Saturday morning I got up and turned the TV on at 5:59 and at last I got to see what " The Trouble With Tracy " was . Yes , the " Trouble With Tracy " was that it was Canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was.<br /><br />Talented Canadian Actor Steve Weston died a few years afterward , but many would argue he effectively " died " the first time he appeared on this show . When I saw it for the first time that cold Saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed , part of me died , too .
0 CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino ; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg , Germany . An easily forgotten movie . Even in spite of a good car chase sequence , this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly . A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life . Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake . Brutality and violence breed the same in return . This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics . Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive - in fare . Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas ca n't boost the calibre of this crime drama . Antonio Sabato also stars with : Paola Tedesco , Guido Lollobrigida , Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia .
0 Kojak meets the mafia . Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable . I never thought that his show was all that great . This is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss , with very predictable results . If you take the car chases and the general rambling out , there is n't much plot development or action . I find mafia movies to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions . Hollywood , and in this case , the Italian cinema , treat these guys as heroes . I saw the film and in a few days I wo n't remember much about it . Lots of shooting , innocent bystanders dying , betrayal , and that sick loyalty . The film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent . But the dubbing is so bad ( due to voices that just could n't come out of those bodies ) , that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay .
0 This is a review of ' Freddy Mercury The Untold Story , ' theatrical release , Chicago Int . Film Festival , 2007 One of the phoniest , uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen . If the film I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV , I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature . Even as a made - for - TV documentary , the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous , pseudo - literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed Infomercial . The only redeeming aspects of this " The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury " -- or , uhm , was it " The Untold Story of Princess Diana " are the original concert , video and TV footage -- unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen . Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights , such as : " He was a free spirit , " ( really .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ... ) belittle those Freddy testimonials , by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe that shed new and affectionate light into Mercury 's complex life and character . And ... what up with the Harry Potter - like boarding school segments ? How did the interview with the first girl - crush ( " ... who now works in a travel agency " ) and members of Freddy 's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury ? Vital milestones of his personal life , his sexuality , his artistic style and growth , Queen , the band remain unexplored . These filmmakers do n't ask a single , provocative question , nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject , instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend , who does n't deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a Sunday night .
0 Yeah , I " get " Pasolini and his milieu , but at the same time , I feel his " Decameron " is largely overrated , and more than a little disturbing . Overrated because the supposed " realism " he introduces ( milling crowds , crumbling architecture , etc . ) are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave . In the pursuit of realism , Pasolini utilized many non - actors , but their deer - in - the - headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off - kilter and inconsistent feel . And frankly -- many of the toothless , misshapenly - featured people are painful to look at.<br /><br />And Pasolini 's " Decameron " is disturbing ( to me at least ) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content . Not because I 'm prudish or homophobic ( I 'm neither ) but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo - realism he otherwise espouses , so it comes off as gratuitous and forced . One can almost hear him say " Ooh -- I've got to stick a cute , naked boy in this scene ! " At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics , and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself , regardless of what his audience might prefer.<br /><br />The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini 's " Decameron " struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller , rather than being an aspect of neo - realism . He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction . Even the Pasolini 's final line of dialog in the film , which some people seem to find pithy ( " Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter ? " ) -- to me , it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way ? In my opinion , a far better - crafted film ( and with MORE homosexual content ) is Fellini 's " Satyricon " . It is also full of bizarre - looking people and absurd situations , but it succeeds because of its pacing , direction and strong storytelling whereas " Decameron " fails by those same elements .
0 Though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments , it is a definitely incorrect assumption . This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio 's 14th century " Decameron " story collection.<br /><br />Set within a medieval Italian town 's largely peasant population , it is a diatribe on the reality of sex ( and its consequences ) within that world and time . A realistic view of Life within this world , it sometimes feels like a journey back in time.<br /><br />Given the depicted human element of its time , one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of Life , at times . Or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the Catholic Church 's rules.<br /><br />Nothing terribly special , but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions .
0 The tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while I was studying cinema . So imagine how I was forced to watch it in complete . Believe me going through hell is much much easier . Our professor told us that this is some film ? ? ? , but he never thought that we 'd disagree or assume the apposite . I do n't think that there is any gods on earth , we 're only humans , so all the filmmakers , therefore they CAN make mistakes , bad movies .. Or very bad too . The main problem was n't that art , by all means , is susceptible to endless points of view , but that a lot of people just do n't get it , that every single human got his own genuine taste , his own opinion , hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made , can also be your worst one ever , and how that is right both ways , but how many people can understand this correctly ? . So my professor believes in this movie , and simply I do n't . However , the only way to evaluate this " thing " is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society 's mentality , imagination , and nature . To tell you the damn truth Mr. Pier Paolo Pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place . The movie is so UGLY . I ca n't stand this , so how about analyzing it , then discovering the potential beauty in it ! ! It 's beyond your mind hideousness , and strangely not for the sake of the movie 's case or anything , it 's for the sake of the unstable vision of ( Pasolini ) . His work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent . The deadly cinematic technique , the effective sense of silliness , and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious . Look at the atrocious acting , the unfruitful cinematography , the awfully poor sets , .. OH MY GOD I 've got the nausea already . It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor . There are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this . So originally , how to continue THAT just to review it fairly ? Actually , you do n't . As this very movie does n't treat you fair at all . There is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera ( ! ) I 'm trying to connect some things like that with Pasolini 's end as murdered .
0 Although I am generally a proponent of the well - made film , I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries , and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully " break the rules . " And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema . But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.<br /><br />Pasolini 's work is visually jarring , but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed , and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography . This is true of DECAMERON . Pasolini often preferred to use non - actors , and while many directors have done so with remarkable result , under Pasolini 's direction his non - actors tend to remain non - actors . This is also true of DECAMERON . Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock , offend , or otherwise disconcert the audience . Such elements can often be used with startling effect , but in Pasolini 's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film . This is also true of DECAMERON.<br /><br />I have been given to understand there are many people who like , even admire Pasolini 's films . Even so , I have never actually met any of them , and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me . Judging him from his works alone , I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not " break the rules " so much by choice as by lack of skill -- and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for " existential boldness , " thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker . I find his work tedious , unimpressive , and pretentious . And this , too , is true of DECAMERON . It is also , sadly , true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure .
0 Pier Paolo Pasolini , or Pee - pee - pee as I prefer to call him ( due to his love of showing male genitals ) , is perhaps THE most overrated European Marxist director - and they are thick on the ground . How anyone can see " art " in this messy , cheap sex - romp concoction is beyond me . Some of the " stories " here could have come straight out of a soft - core porn film , and I am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal , often pointless stories . Anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb oddity should really sink his teeth into the " Der Schulmaedchenreport " soft - porn German 70s movie series , because that 's what " Decameron " looks like to me.<br /><br />Besides , the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels , from start to finish : < br /><br />1 . Editing . An example : at 1 hour:15 minutes:45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place . It was supposed to be placed about a minute later , but I guess that Pasolini must have hired boozed - up editors who have little time for the " fine details " of movie - making . Pee - pee - pee 's fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally - which I very much doubt . Besides , even if that were true , that would be even worse , because that story gains absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow . ( This is n't exactly " Eraserhead " or one of Tarantino 's broken - form films ... ) < br /><br />2 . Acting . Vey sloppy . Triple Pee 's fans ( all 8 of them ) proudly declare how 3P - O uses " real people instead of actors " . ( Are n't actors people ? Or are they Martians ? Sure , many actors have sub - par IQs but does that mean we should treat them with contempt ... ? ) Other directors have used amateurs and succeeded ( such as Alan Parker or De Niro ) , so why are PPP 's amateurs so utterly awful in his movies ? The answer is once again appalling sloppiness . Pasolini is sloppy in everything , and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can . He is a lazy director , an IMperfectionist if you like . The anti - Kubrick , I suppose ... Pee - pee - pee 's principal goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible ( and young men that are to his liking ) . In Pasolini 's world there is a simple formula : lack of teeth + strange face = realism . It 's all well and fine to have them toothless , but at least try to eke out some at least semi - decent performances out of these inexperienced neo - thespians , otherwise you 're an amateur yourself - an amateur director , in Pasolini 's case . Whether 3P-0 was n't capable of this feat or simply did n't care does n't change anything . ( Who knows ... maybe he did n't even notice the awful acting ? ) < br /><br />3 . Audio . The synchronization . If 3P-0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when filming a movie , then he ought to have at least made a concerted effort in post - production , i.e. getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio , so that we the viewers would n't have to watch mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie.<br /><br />4 . Lack of concept . We have close to a dozen stories which are n't connected in any meaningful way . Some are anti - Church ( more on that later ) , while some are merely sex yarns i.e. cheap male ( sometimes gay ) fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else . The stories and characters are not amusing ( if at all ) on an intelligent level , but on the basest level . 10 year - old kids can laugh here ... And there is nothing wrong with that , but then do n't call it exalted , intellectual art ! < br /><br />5 . As a result of point 4 , there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories . That goes without saying . Pee - pee - pee could have arranged the order in any other way , and we would have had the exact same movie . This also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning , etc . " Decameron " is like a bowl of spaghetti that way : when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want , it makes no difference at all.<br /><br />6 . The pointlessness of the stories ' resolutions . Most stories end with a cheap gag / joke , i.e. some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comic - book , whereas some stories do n't even have a conclusion : they merely end . Finito . At best , the stories are watchable semi - anecdotes , barely any deeper meaning there - unless you find " deep " meanings in a porno . There is , of course , nothing easier than looking for and finding " meaning " where there is an absence of it . Hence even any hardcore porn film can be philosophized / mused over endlessly . It 's easy and fun . Try it , oh ye 8 PPP fans ! < br /><br />As for the Church - bashing ... Some viewers get all excited about his attack on Catholicism and what - not . In principal , that 's all well and fine - after all , I 'm an atheist myself - but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist . It 's like the pot calling the kettle black . A Marxist criticizing the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity ? Where does he get the nerve ? Besides , Pasolini was n't an atheist , hence his high - and - mighty and self - righteous stance is n't justified . After all , Marxists are believers : they merely substituted the accepted god with the idea of a Utopia , which is merely another supernatural wishful - thinking fantasy . Hence I can not get excited about PPP 's anti - religion antics.<br /><br />This sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolini saying rather pretentiously : " I wonder ... Why produce a work of art when it 's nice just to dream about it ? " He was n't actually referring to this silly little movie as art , was he ... ? In case he was - the poor deluded man - then I have to wonder why he did n't just leave it at dreaming , and NOT make all those bad movies ... <br /><br />Wanna read my altered subtitles of Bergman movies ?

0 SPOILERS : I 'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews . It was awful . The script and voice acting alone ruined it . Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game . You almost pray for their deaths . And worst of all , there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in The Beast Within.<br /><br />The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing . If you 're expecting some kind of Anne Rice style vampire story , forget it . This game 's story has very little to do with vampires . You wo n't even see any till about the very end and even then , you wo n't get to fight them.<br /><br />The story has radical , and pretty much blasphemous , views of Christianity . I 'm amazed it got off the drawing board . I 'm not even Christian and I found it offensive . Mostly , the story centers around a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure . The kidnapping of a royal baby , which should have been the focus , really gets pushed aside . There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby . In fact , he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks.<br /><br />The graphics are pretty bad . The characters move about at a snail 's pace even on the best of systems . They are chunky and outdated . And it 's hard to go from the FMV of The Beast Within to this horrible game engine for Blood of the Sacred.<br /><br />The relationship between Gabriel and Grace takes an awful turn , too . I really do n't know why it was so horribly rushed , but they do sleep together . And it 's not fun . Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he does n't think she 's the one for him . And he seems really grossed out that they slept together . But he 's so unlikeable throughout the game , that you almost do n't even care at that point . His dialogue was the worst in the game . And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game . By the end of the game , Grace leaves him with what appears to be a Dear John letter . I guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were.<br /><br />I found the story to be annoying and boring . I was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires . And I was expecting to get to see and fight vampires , maybe even have Gabriel or Grace turn into one . But no . Instead , the story focused on the author 's warped vision of Christianity . What a shame . Here they had the elements for a great adventure , and instead we got this.<br /><br />For me , the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end . We do get a few action style puzzles at the end . But it was n't worth suffering through the entire game to get to them.<br /><br />I ca n't really recommend this game . I had gotten it back when it came out , years ago , and I hated the game engine so much that I shelved it for years . I only recently dusted it off to see what I 'd been missing . And now , I 'm very sorry that I did . My favorite characters were ruined . I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series . And I hope they get it right next time . It would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment .
0 " Blood of the Sacred , Blood of the Damned " is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games , a series of adventure games about the roguish writer / paranormal detective , Gabriel Knight . Gabriel and his companion , Grace , have been asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so - called " night visitors . " When the son of Prince James is kidnapped , Gabriel pursues the night visitors to Rennes le Château , where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Despite the marketing , this game is not about vampires . Vampires have a token appearance in the game , but never command center stage , as did the voodoo hounfor in " Sins of the Fathers " or the werewolves in " The Beast Within . " Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires , or to research lore on vampires . Although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game , their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot.<br /><br />A large part of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight installments was in the relationships which Gabriel formed with the villains . Through these relationships , the player could not help but sympathize with the villain , and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster . However , in " Blood of the Sacred , " Gabriel 's only interaction with the villain is through a single , cheesy interview , which does nothing to endear the villain to the player.<br /><br />The roles that Gabriel and Grace play in this mystery are fairly futile . Gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure - hunter tour group staying at his hotel , but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring . Grace spends her time researching the mystery of Rennes le Château , but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries.<br /><br />The actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite --- the vampire leader --- are insupportable . The ally leaves hints about the mystery of Rennes le Château in broad daylight and expects Grace ( and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group ) to find them . However , he could have revealed the mystery to Grace in its entirety on day 1 , instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours . And in the end , he simply tells Grace the mystery in its entirety anyway.<br /><br />Meanwhile , the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming , because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child . The only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory.<br /><br />The game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the Holy Grail . The kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted , replaced with a race against the Vatican to uncover the mystery of Rennes le Château . Since Gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly Catholic , this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development.<br /><br />All in all , the game was a disappointing installment in the series , despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight .
0 Uwe Boll has done the impossible : create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game ; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content . So , as an adaptation , it 's a success.<br /><br />Unfortunately , it 's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here , so do n't expect the movie to be actually any good . while it does have it 's moment , " Postal " wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through.<br /><br />At its core , Postal is a satire on the United States , as done by a twelve year old kid . Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value : the more offensive , the funnier , and the more exaggerated the funnier . This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss . Yes , some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck . High points include the director satirizing himself , and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles . Low points include .. well pretty much everything else.<br /><br />After the initial surprise wears off , Postal simply becomes a bore to watch . Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes , but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.<br /><br />This probably would have worked as a short movie , but it 's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes ( although it feels twice as long ) . There are nice ideas and nice tries , but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10
0 I 'm not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time . I would like to say , however , that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous . Johnnymacbest , you ca n't play that card , and I mean the nationalism patriotic card , to make people not watch this movie . this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country ( oh yea i played that card)even though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera , but the world is full of controversy , and its the same thing you 've heard before , like the GTA controversy . It 's a comedy , laugh and be disgusted , not disgusted all together , its dark humor and obviously you do n't have the heart to take it , the past is past , yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on , that was ! ! ! 7 ! ! ! years ago . You can still watch this movie and have good moral values . < br /><br />Besides I 'm insane , and who needs a soul ?
0 Okay this is gona be short and sweet review ... Something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was.<br /><br />This movie is $ ^@% . There 's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll stop making movies from franchises people liked . Blood Rayne being a biggie there.<br /><br />The jokes are good ... if you 've never heard them a THOUSAND times before . THe acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that . I even a few moments wonder if they 're even using a script.<br /><br />The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games . HELLO if you 've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular . There 's way too much story for such a stupid movie . like I said . I WOULDN'T even steal this movie . ANd for the person who says this is ' Funniest movie of 2007' .......... need to take a look around , the news is better than this .
0 I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival , with the great Dr. Uwe Boll in attendance.<br /><br />The film is , simply put , very , very bad . And no , not in the usual Uwe Boll " so bad it 's actually entertaining " way , but just plain bad . The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life ( because of a past criminal record , apparently ) , ca n't get a job , and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife . This man turns to his cult - leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus . Al Qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys , and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence.<br /><br />The acting is awful ( except for Dave Foley , who really tries , despite it all ) , the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion , and people taking a poo . It 's supposed to be satire , but I 'm not sure of what.<br /><br />Think " Airplane ! " , but done by the creators of South Park , and without any jokes .
0 If I could i would give ZERO stars for this one , but unfortunately i have to give one ... <br /><br />There is no single scene I could laugh about ... but the game did n't make me laugh either . So if you 're some ill retarded folk , go to your local cinema , watch this movie and give it 10 stars , like some people here already did.<br /><br />but for me ... in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time i wasted my time to see a Boll movie and it was definitely my last!<br /><br />0/10 ... i 'm ashamed of being from the same country as Uwe Boll!<br /><br />PLEASE PLEASE KEEP HIM FROM MAKING MORE MOVIES ! ! ! ! !
0 I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I 'm glad I did n't pay for it . This movie is just disgusting . Its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences(such as the shootout in " Little Germany " ) . I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie .. and a lot of which I did n't agree of.<br /><br />1 . Dave Foley 's penis . 2 . The fart jokes . 3 . The Poop jokes . 4 . The Dude was a pussy . 5 . No Gary Coleman . 6 . The Talibans 7 . Again making fun of Bush .. WE GET IT HE 'S AN IDIOT .. move on . 8 . The Dude has blonde hair . 9 . The Plot . 10 . The killing of minors 11 . Uwe Boll was in it . 12 . Most of the cast were just outrages and out there.<br /><br />Now the ( few ) good ones < br /><br />1 . The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game . 2 . Lots of action . 3 . Crotchy made a return ( and a cameo of the maker of Postal ) 4 . Uhm .. I did n't have to pay for it . 5 . There are a few " what the ef " moments < br /><br />Boll did it again . He made another crappy game into movie adaption . Kudos to you , Mr Boll . 2/10
0 Today , I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood.<br /><br />Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation . 911 changed everything . It changed our perception of security . It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity . Most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world.<br /><br />However , I ca n't not stress how utterly repulsed , disillusioned , and angry I am at the careless , blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction . This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word - of - mouth among moviegoers and critics alike ; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press . Hollywood has sunk to a new low . Even lower than the low - down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty . Behind it all is Uwe Boll . I am very angry at this movie . How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost ? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy ? ! ? ! ? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world ? ! ? ! ? ! How ... dare ... they ? < br /><br />To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty , I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength : Remember . Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person . Think back to that day , ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day . Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones . Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes . Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks.<br /><br />Ask yourself if you have a soul.<br /><br />Think . Remember . Respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all .

0 Wow You guys are way too nice!!!Corny , Corny , Corny That is how I feel about that film . It started well with a good idea , A guy ( Edward Asner ) escape from Jail dressed as Santa , a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real Santa so the Fake Santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen money.the film is like a Christmas version of " Whistle down the wind " . The movie start well but gradually it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just ca nt take this film seriously . For example you get the Scrooge type character called Sumner ( Rene Auberjonois ) who 's a total Douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish , he treat his son so bad that he do n't even buy him decent clothes , the poor kid wears Jeans with Holes in it ! but a 45 second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing Christmas Carol and giving his neglected son a hug ... yep that is how Corny it is ... I 'm all for feel good movie especially during Christmas and I am a big fan of seasonal TV movie but this one is way too over the top for me , it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just do n't match with the rest of it . It 's not totally bad , there are some solid acting , especially from the children but there are plenty of better Christmas film around .
0 I wonder who was responsible for this mess . The jokes would n't have worked for gilligan 's island . If this had gone to series , would there have been jokes about Auschwitz , or would Eva have to replace her oven , only to have Adolf suggest the kind that seats 50 ? ? Another post compared this show to I love Lucy . The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations , and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence . < br /><br />After the damage the Nazi 's did to England and the number of people they killed , I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced .
0 This may be the worst show I 've ever seen . Aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about Hitler , it just is n't funny or entertaining in any way . It is very similar to a 1950 's sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations , but while it can be well done like in I Love Lucy , it 's just not funny here . I think the show was based around the novelty " look , it 's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure " but it just fell flat in every regard . The guy playing Hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone . I wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air . I thought America had some tasteless show , but the Brits had us beat this time . America would never air a sitcom about Hitler , although we did have that show about Lincoln 's slave , The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer . Chances are you 'll probably never see this show , since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on DVD .
0 Except for the Brady Variety Hour , this was some of the hokiest television I 've seen in a while . The video production qualities were n't too bad , but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80 's . And Marie Osmond looks like she did battle with the Avon Lady .. and lost big time . WAY too much eyeliner.<br /><br />It was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid take part in this . Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavillion in World Showcase that would be opening ' in about a year.'<br /><br />As of this writing it is 17 years later and it has n't opened yet ( Unless you count Disney 's Animal Kingdom . ) All in all though , for all the shortcomings , this still an interesting visual piece of Disney history .

0 From everything I 'd read about the movie , I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme . Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done . Especially the writing ! Without good writing a movie does n't have a chance . The writer / director said in an interview that he did n't want to give away how the title relates to the story . Believe me , it was NO big surprise . I kept waiting for the teenage / young adult back - story to unfold , but it never did . As someone who has gone through a divorce , I was very disappointed . This movie would have been NO comfort to me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian !
0 Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love . " Wanders " is probably not the word . I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend . He recalls to the day when the relationship ended . The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions . He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went . I 'm not a counselor , but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage ? ? ? ? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age ( also divorced ) who , instead of being " turned off " by his creepiness , starts to become interested in him . Did I mention how creepy Dave is ? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person . He does n't move his arms when he walks , either . It 's just weird . Too make a long story short , Dave plots to hunt down Mary ( the old gal friend ) and kill her ... err ... I mean confront her . He does so . Which was really creepy . He believes her to be married , yet he STILL flies half - way across the country to meet her . He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone , before he " drops in " on her . He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less , and flies back to the new young girlfriend . We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value . I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions .... "I heard another Dave & Mary song ! "
0 I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian based . The director had a good idea / intentions when making this movie but it could have been better . I can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life . However , I did n't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive , mean and rude . The main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him . They were n't understanding at all and they used God as a reason to explain their behaviors . The main character , nor anyone else did n't know if the ex - girlfriend was divorced , still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with . His friends were suppose to be Christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not . So many times we do things in life where we do n't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him . The ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend , when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name , address and phone number ... she seemed to be the stalker!. she did n't seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself . God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like God does n't care about true love ... only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with . We all make mistakes ... it 's all about what steps you take to make amends . Like I said the movie had potential but I was tired of the one - sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so - called ... well - meaning friends . This movie did n't hold true to the Christian belief of love but i give it a C for its effort .
0 I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this , God that and Christ is our saviour stuff . The movie and the story line did not need it . If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous . The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been .
0 I watched the whole movie , waiting and waiting for something to actually happen . Maybe it 's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology ? Is it a weird re - telling of the Oedipal myth : I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him ? I did n't understand why certain plot elements were even present : why was the construction upstairs , why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so , why have the scenes at all with the father at work , why have such a nice kitchen if you 're only going to eat takeout , why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around . I see lots of good reviews for this movie ... has my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s b - movies and old sci fi flicks ?
0 The acting in the film is really well done honestly , but the movie is so slow and so boring , as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt . I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this , he did a great job , so did the other actors as I mentioned but man ... this is one of the worst dragged out films I have ever seen . Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good , but other than that , avoid it . This film has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous . < br /><br />I never , ever , walk out on films , but watching this one at home with family , I walked out . Yeah , it was that boring . Apparently my comment does n't have enough lines to post , so here 's some more filler . I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched .
0 This movie " Joshua " is extremely disturbing , and downright pointless . It actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it . Without giving away the story it is about a young boy 's reaction to his newborn sister , and that is just the tip of the iceberg . During the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable . Adding insult to injury , by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less , who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults . There is no redemption , no justice served , and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them . Frankly , I did not enjoy watching this movie . It was extremely unsettling . Even for those who might enjoy horror movies , this movie could be too much . Despite the fact this movie was well acted , the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist 's waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure .
0 I did not enjoy the film , Joshua , at all . Perhaps it is because I saw another , much better similar film titled Orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it 's really just because this film was not very good . I am going with the ladder . Sure , the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that does n't mean the film could not succeed . It could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building , boring , uneventful and really did n't leave me thinking anything more than ' that was n't very good ' when it was all over.<br /><br />At the end , Joshua 's motivations are revealed . I wo n't give that away but the reality is that he did n't really accomplish his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother , Abby , disappearing about 3/4th through the movie , all arrows point to her returning home soon . She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then Joshua 's Father / Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically . So .. should n't she be coming home soon ? Wo n't Joshua have failed ? Wo n't his Mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his Father soon ? I question the Father since his future is left open ended.<br /><br />At the end of the day , I did n't care about the characters . The evil demon child Joshua was n't really scary . The storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring . Suspense fell flat every single time . When it was over I could n't believe I had sat through the whole thing . < br /><br />4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially Vera Farmiga as the Mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil ' child ' go see Orphan . Now that 's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie .
0 Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell , I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of ' Joshua . ' Heck , I was n't even aware he was in ' Joshua ' until I started the movie . So it goes without saying , I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie , not the leads . A sort of ' Rosemary 's Baby , ' ' The Omen ' or any other demonic kid movie ' Joshua ' was billed . Unfortunately , it fell flat . Slow , incredibly slow , and flat . Yet , I continued on to see how this would all resolve , hoping beyond belief , the ending climax would shed some light on the subject . Okay , I admit , it did ( a wee bit ) but what a stale closing . And what a low - low budget movie , or at least that 's how they designed it . A person falls  you do n't see the drop , you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood . A person gets hit by a cab  you do n't see it , you see someone complaining , holding a bike up . I 'm not sure if this is called " style " or laziness or simply , lack of funds for special effects . We have a " rich " family with a crazy mom , a workaholic father attempting to balance everything , a kid  Joshua , who may / may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot . She cries as much as we see how many days she 's alive  and what was that about ? Are there rats above or is it Joshua ? Is his mother nuts ? Is Joshua crazy ? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family ? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers ? Or does he drive his family to the brink ? I do n't think so . They were nuts prior , and no " so - called " acting could make me believe otherwise . Unfortunately , barely any questions were answered , barely any open doors shut . I 'm sure that might have been the idea , but for Pete 's sake , give me something . Anything . There are plenty better kid - gone - wild movies to explore . Joshua 's more like the Mini - Me of the antichrist .
0 The Lady in Cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60 's . The writing , not the acting , is at center stage . Did I say - pure camp ! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay . Broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day ( camp- wise ) . Most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors . The action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs . And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers . Amazing to note they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53 . The musical score , wait . . . was there a score ? Well , you get the point . Watch it with friends who want a good laugh . it 's full of them .
0 Terrible film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome . Here , he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea.<br /><br />Rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman . Naturally , it 's the woman below the sea . Her room mate , Lainie Kazan , soon winds up dead on the floor.<br /><br />An aging Richard Conte plays a police officer and friend of Rome . When a local club owner gets killed , the blame falls on Rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene . That 's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action.<br /><br />Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue . Her acting leads a lot to be desired . < br /><br />Martin Gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him.<br /><br />By the film 's end , you do n't know why the girl was murdered . Do n't even bother to ask .
0 Detective Tony Rome ( Frank Sinatra ) returns to the screen after his self titled debut , this time it 's a film that 's played for erm  laughs . While on a diving trip , Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea , her feet as you might expect , encased in cement . Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky . Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types , who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect , he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone . The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective , oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch , but he fails miserably , in this ham fisted vanity project . The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding , every woman in the film is a dither head , who likes bending over is front of the camera , Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles . There 's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief , this was a film made by " real men " for " real men " to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality , it 's a shameful shambles .
0 Lady in Cement - PI spoof with ole Blue Eyes . Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny " comedy".Burdened by an annoying and repetitious Hugo Montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this 1968 flick just never rises above slightly too bawdy to be on TV made for television movie status . Dan Blocker is effective in the Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia big galoot role and Raquel Welch should thank her personal trainer . The only thing that makes the DVD worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for Welch flicks like Bandolero , Fantastic Voyage , Mother , Jugs & Speed and Myra Breckinridge . Even if you get the DVD - skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features . Besides tons of mysoginistic asides - Sinatra lisps @ the homosexual owners of the local Go - Go bar . A relic that needs to be put back in the time capsule . D
0 No doubt Frank Sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer . After all , very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take , and that was pretty much Sinatra 's modus operandi on set.<br /><br />I feel that as the 1960 's wore on , the quality of the man 's films really started to tank . The Tony Rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with Dean Martin 's Matt Helm series which came out at the same time . Perhaps even a James Bond competition , but nothing really worked for Frank during these years . His personal life in shambles , his music fading out ... Sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950 's . The last great Sinatra film of this period was probably Von Ryan 's Express in 1965 .
0 I am not from America and I know what ' Wife Swap ' is . When a show came out of that name I was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program . But what I got was a real sucking stupidity . I was misjudged by its title name , it has no adult contents , no nudity , not even vulgar dialogues ( broad casted threw Hallmark channel and I think they edited / mute out such contents to make it neat).<br /><br />A show which gives a picture of current American / western family state , overweight chubby peoples , polluted teenagers , and their sucking family goings . In each episode two wives / two mothers ( more correctly ) were chosen to live in each others home and re - changes each others family routine with their new own rule . Sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad . On the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days . It 's the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights . I was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff . I mean who make this program , more than that who gave the name " Wife Swap " ; its better to be called as " Mother Swap " . All in all it corrupts all the great things the real Wife Swap stands for ! < br /><br />Wife Swap = Average Sucking Reality Show .
0 If this guy can make a movie , then I sure as hell can make one too.<br /><br />In fact , if you hire me to make a movie for you , I promise to do the following:<br /><br />1 ) I will add more naked women . This movie had none . I think cheesy B - class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body . I would n't want to let my viewers down.<br /><br />2 ) I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it 's only a dream . I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes . And , considering the movie was only like an hour long , the dream - to - movie - length ratio was quite high . And , if I do decide to do a dream sequence , I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on . I mean , who sleeps in leather pants??<br /><br />3 ) I will not rip off any movies like Star Wars or the Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big - budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine . < br /><br />4 ) And finally , I will not mix modern technology with the undead . I mean , a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned it into an evil rolly - polly monster before the screen blew up or something.<br /><br />So , if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production , count on me : wanna - b - movie director extraordinaire .
0 I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable . While only 70 minutes in length I still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again . The acting was of the ` if I scream and say * * * k a lot I 'm intense ' school . And the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed out.<br /><br />While I never go to Full Moon for great film making I have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this .
0 Decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things.<br /><br />I also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff.<br /><br />if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the AD police then this might up your street.<br /><br />but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style.<br /><br />Great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands . Worth checking out if only for the soundtrack .
0 At first look of the plot tagline I figured it could have been a decent film . Could I have ever been more wrong ? The beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film . For the first 10 minutes you do n't notice the cheesy acting , horrible sound and god - awful special effects , but then it gets worse . Just about 20 minutes into it I was asking myself , " What was the plot again ? " I could only ask that question when I was n't busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film . The main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film , even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in - between . The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re - live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie . Now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off Morpheus from " The Matrix , " although he is doing just a horrible job . The actor 's talking about " Star Wars " and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable . Now at the end of the movie you do n't realize that it 's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing . The " Morpheus " character dies , the ONLY good thing about the movie . He utters a couple words and the credits roll . What is this ? No plot , bad acting , cheesy everything , it could n't get any worse . Please , if you value human decency , DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !
0 save your money . i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this . the casting is terrible , the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the 80 's . this movie is so bad i ca nt even suggest renting it .
0 Before the Internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the idea behind it . Unfortunately that s all it was - the generally opinion that nowadays the Web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life . Since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer . The point ? Just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence . Which is basically what spam is without the violence - its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal is n't a priority , We see the Internet get worse by the week - the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which ARE illegal . So the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing - there actually IS a site called Horrorvision which is a porn site - but this one KILLS the people who enter its portals . The story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion . The definitive movie on this theme of destroying an Internet Service Provider has yet to be made but clearly many DO need destroying as they wo n't be shut down when there 's money to be made . Calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens
0 This is crap .... utter crap . I can not believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this . Full Moon has a number of awful films , but this has got to be the worst . First off , the plot does n't exist . It 's odd . It 's like , they took an idea for the story , and kind of never really got around to developing it . They seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two " heroes " drove around in the desert , and Bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes . There were two scenes in the movie ( when Dez and Dazzy are driving , and when Dez and Bradbury are driving ) where it just went on and on and on ... it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action . They just drove for about 5 minutes , with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape.<br /><br />Next , we come to the acting , which is simply horrible . First off , the girl who plays Dazzy is just a beast . She is so scary looking , I wanted to look away when she was on screen ! Horrible casting . Then , you have the guy who played Dez , who could n't act if his life depended on it . His " crying " is actually funny , and his madman antics are even funnier . The guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad , as is the guy who plays Bradbury . There was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever.<br /><br />The makeup effects ... hmmm , can anyone say pathetic ? The " effects " were so fake , they were laughable . The crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone , they cut away , and when they come back , the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound . Nice . Did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what ? ! I must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl 's apartment ... nice makeup there too . I think they were going for a drugged look , and I think she was supposed to have a black guy , but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween.<br /><br />This movie is just horrible from the start . The story is stupid and very , very unoriginal , the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old , the acting is the lowest of the low , and so on . STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs . It 's only 70 minutes long in the first place , and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel . Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage .
0 A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child , the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series , even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 . I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels . The dream child was the worst without a doubt , I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels . But I guess they just lost the charm , the story was just ridicules and I was n't happy with where it went . Alice just became more annoying , she 's not Nancy or Kirsten , so her carrying this film on her own did n't work for me . Freddy is also loosing his scare , this was just getting a bit silly.<br /><br />Alice is back and she 's carrying a child , she could n't be happier with her life . But Freddy is also back and he 's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie . But anyways , he wants her child and to be born into the world again . Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too ? Well that 's what A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy 's childhood was like and that maybe that 's the one thing that can defeat him.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series . I do n't think anyone could be happy with this sequel . Just the story was really silly , I mean it could have possibly worked , but once again , it was just executed the wrong way . I know that if you 're looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series , you should watch it , but I really would n't recommend it , it 's not worth it , at least in my opinion.<br /><br />3/10
0 After the success of Part 4 , another sequel was a natural move . However they should have stopped it before it began . Alice , having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims , which of course are Alice 's friends . Strange Nightmare movie , very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting . The special effects are good , but the movie itself is not .
0 The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches . < br /><br />(Moderate Spoiler Alert ) Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone : The Movie , which delivers death by cartoon . Still this was handled nicely , especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out.<br /><br />Additionally , there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle.<br /><br />Having said that , I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale , because this was pretty awful . I bought " Soul Survivors " at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream . However , where " Soul Survivors " has nothing to redeem it , or have it make any sense , this at least had a couple of stylish notes , referred to above.<br /><br />Interestingly , the DVD lets you go to the 8 ' nightmares ' where something actually happens , which is the only way to watch this . The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable.<br /><br />3 out of 10 .
0 When you look back at another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddy 's Revenge , you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new . And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series . Yes , there 's the creative deaths as usual , like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing " Super Freddy " but even scenes like that are n't used to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are just boring.<br /><br />This marked the official death of scariness to the series . Freddy seems to be the comedic relief now ... but to what?<br /><br />My Rating : 4/10
0 I will stat of with the plot Alice , having survived the previous instalment of the Nightmare series , finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again . This time , the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice 's unborn child . His intention is to be " born again " into the real world . The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother , but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son ? This movie did start of really well as we see Alice dreaming of being Amanda Kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 Manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she Amanda giving birth to Freddy again.<br /><br />Alice and Dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new Friends its ' no long before Freddy start to kill again , I did like the first dead it okay , not as good as the other deaths or dreams.<br /><br />Freddy himself did n't seem to be Scary in this movie at all , the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all.<br /><br />Acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall I think this movie was really Dull . ( Still not worst movie of the series , Freddy Dead is the worst)<br /><br />4/10
0 " The Dream Child " of 1989 is the fifth film in the ( generally overrated ) " Nightmare " series , and at the latest from this point on , the series became total garbage . The only good films in the series were Wes Craven 's 1984 original , and the third part , " The Dream Warriors " of 1987 . The second part was disappointing and boring , and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes . This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for ( admittedly great ) visuals , and one creepy scene , a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence . The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor - clawed maniac - turned - jokester yelling stupid one - liners , and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses , who desperately try to avoid falling asleep , because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams . Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson , and a bunch of uninteresting crap , such as a super - dumb ' eerie ' children 's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel ... In Short : No originality , just a decline of the old formula , and an over - load of painfully annoying jokes . My ( generous ) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals , and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel , " Freddy 's Dead " , which is awful beyond belief . In case you 're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast , " The Dream Child " should be avoided , and even if you are , this is more than likely to disappoint .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />Alice , having defeated Freddy at the end of the last film , is now trying to re - adjust her life . But her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence- Freddy , trying to come out into their world again.<br /><br />It 's interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing Freddy films- Charles Russell ( Eraser , The Mask ) Renny Harlin ( The Long Kiss Goodnight , Cutthroat Island , Cliffhanger , Die Hard 2 ) and here Stephen Hopkins ( Lost in Space , Predator 2 . ) But while Russell and Harlin made a good job of it , Hopkins IMO has made something of a podge with this entry , that should be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />The story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here , with Freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby . Even at about an hour and a half , it all gets rather tiresome , and of course , not scary at all.<br /><br />The " bon appetit , bitch " catch - phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry . *
0 Like Freddy 's Revenge , this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and does n't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it . Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends . This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise - cracks are quite poor , so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy . < br /><br / > I 've not alot to say about this . It 's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four , but not worth watching a movie over . Uninspriring and unenjoyable , possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series .
0 I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series . It was so boring that I could n't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over , it even tires me to write a review on it.<br /><br />Okay , # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker . # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series . It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4 , which is a good thing , basically . They tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy . Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares . Because of that Nightmare 5 : The Dream Child is neither funny nor is it scary . What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors ( maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox).<br /><br />The plot ( Freddy killing Lisa 's friends by using the dreams of Lisa 's unborn child ) has a good base but it just is n't enough for 90 minutes of film . Sometimes the story gets very confusing ( maybe because there is n't any ) and you ca n't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at . The screenplay must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself ( let me say that I do n't like cheese though , even if I am from Switzerland ) . Not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4.<br /><br />Don't bother to rent / buy this film if not for completeness , it 's quite a mess.<br /><br />My rating : 4/10 ( get used to it , # 6 is also a messy one ... )
0 I am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one , or vice versa . Being that it is nearly fifteen years since I saw this film , the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well . Perhaps it is simply because I only watched it once or twice , but I doubt it . If there was anything worth remembering about this film , you can rest assured I would remember it.<br /><br />At the time this film was released , the franchise was still entering its dying phase , so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it . It 's never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics . One such article had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans , so he decides to go after Alice 's unborn son . So far , so good , but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience . It should not be left to some unrelated publication.<br /><br />Making use of the trivia given in part three about Freddy 's conception , one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the " horror for infants " category , but alas , that was not to be . It goes to show the sheer idiocy of the American ratings system that a piece of B'harni - esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original.<br /><br />By this time , the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career . Fortunately , or unfortunately depending on how you look at it , Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting . Or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast . Either way , given that her last role was in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade , I doubt she really had anything else going for her . Even poor old Robert Englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years.<br /><br />Given that box office returns were in a steady decline , and not just for this franchise , at the time , one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable . In fact , this particular film , like its immediate predecessor , was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience , both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise . Despite this , part five must be given some credit for not having the bright , luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at.<br /><br />I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five a one out of ten . By trying to appeal to everyone , or the MPAA 's idea of everyone , it succeeds in appealing to noone . Like parts two and four , one could erase it from the continuity entirely , and nobody would notice the difference .
0 This film is so incredibly bad , that I almost felt sick watching it . Up until this point , the other installments had at least one good thing about it . Part 1 was suspenseful and gory . Part 2 was off beat and entertaining . Part 3 was interesting with great effects . Part 4 had great music , good special effects , and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger . Part 5 is more boring than anything I 've ever seen before . Alice , a much prettier blond , from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan . At parts , this supposed Elm Street installment turns into a daytime soap . The newer characters seem harsh , and even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder . Freddy seems to be completely out of this one . He looks tired , and does n't seem to be as gruesome . His one - liners seem out of place and different , where as in Part 4 they could be pretty funny . Leslie Bohem 's story never gets off the ground and Stephen Hopkins ' direction is so bad , that it makes my grandmother look good ! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic . It 's also confusing and pretty stupid . Avoid Part 5 at all costs !
0 It 's getting worse , the series is on a serious down fall . The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really , really terrible movies . Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast ca n't act . The story is Alice , having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series , finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again . This time , the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice 's unborn child . His intention is to be " born again " into the real world . The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother , but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son ? Check out the first three , miss the next three then watch the last one .
0 Bottom - of - the - Freddy barrel . This is the worst film in the series , beating " Freddy 's Revenge " for that title . A cheap - looking ( with mediocre special effects ) , incoherent mess , with Freddy turned into a punster . He has one or two cool lines , but that does n't save this illogical and sloppy sequel .
0 Come on . The new twist is nearly ok , but from avenging the Elm Street children Freddy is just killing people now . More of the same : Special effects with no actual character development or anything . Simply bad and insulting . SCARY .. ? Nope . Not at all . Just bad .
0 This one is just like the 6th movie . The movie is really bad . It offers nothing in the death department . The one - liners are bad and are something that should n't be in a NOES movie . Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie . Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while . The characters are extremely underdeveloped . All in all better than the 6th one , but still one the worst movies of the series . My rating 2/10
0 A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child < br /><br />This is a bad movie . There 's no escaping it . I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies . But even being a fan I ca n't help but see this movie is mediocre.<br /><br />There 's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters . By now they had just given up . They do n't even try . They are the production of course , hoping for a few more easy dollars.<br /><br />The story does n't grab your attention . Its so simple it 's almost absent.<br /><br />Alice , a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant . Freddy is coming back through the baby 's dreams . At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice must find his mother . And that 's it . < br /><br />The story advances slowly since there 's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting . In fact that 's the only scary thing , the acting , since the deaths are not even slightly cool . < br /><br />The characters are so uninteresting we could n't care less for them.<br /><br />The girls are as unattractive as possible . The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group . I 've seen better actors in school plays . It 's embarrassing really.<br /><br />Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this . She is beautiful , sexy and has some talent . But the material just did n't let her shine . What a pity.<br /><br />Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin´s brilliant direction in Dream Master . He tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension Harlin and Craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found.<br /><br />The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel . It 's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name . < br /><br />The end for the once scary Freddy . It 's too sad to see him now . A clown that 's not funny . A bad joke . Goodbye Freddy .
0 What happened ? Those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen . Nightmare on Elm St. had gone noticeably downhill after it 's cult - classic of a first film , but I doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration . Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film , and nobody is more distraught about it than I am.<br /><br />This is by far the worst ANOES film of the lot . It does n't seem too bad at the beginning , with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring Alice . But then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events . I mean , sure , Freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy , but this one is like a train - wreck in it 's poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup . It feels like you 're coming down with a terrible headache , not like you 're getting scared . So the directing totally fails . None of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here , and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic ( the death by food especially ) , except for that one cool scene that 's crafted like a comic book battle . That 's why this movie gets a point.<br /><br />The storyline ... lame , lame , lame , LAME . It was an excuse to gross people out and to make the MPAA mad , and nothing more.<br /><br />The acting ... should I mention how Freddy has been turned into a childish boogey - man - like clown figure ? How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old 's horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we 've all known and loathed since the first film ? That arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again ... ugh . And his one liners , too . Throughout the whole movie , they suck . Badly . A grade - schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit Freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film . Hell , a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what Freddy 's been told to say here . Who wrote the script for this ? This movie is really irritating , too . It seems so pointless . Like a gnat buzzing around your head , a gnat that just WON'T go away . Freddy is just an annoyance now . We 've seen him so many times before . This one 's nothing different , and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one - liners and get off your TV screen . Alice , instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie , seems annoying and very shallow , and this is obviously due to the horrible , horrible script this movie was fitted with . Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor , and sometimes it shines through the cracks here , but she ca n't save this movie . The other actors just suck , mostly.<br /><br />The last 15 or 20 minutes of Freddy 's existence in this film are awful and embarrassing . I hope Englund was ashamed of this . Who wants to see Freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out , laughing like a cartoon villain ? This movie destroyed anything positive I felt for the Nightmare series . I ca n't ever watch them again without this image running through my head ; of the mangled cartoon abomination that Krueger became . He was slowly becoming a jokey , retarded pop culture icon , but this is the lowest of the low . This is rock bottom . Nobody will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously again after seeing this film . He 's naught but a joke , a clown that is long overdue for retirement . Pathetic.<br /><br />Of all the movies I could hate , why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St , a series which I once adored and liked a lot ? The Dream Child represents the death of a legend , and the shattering of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St. series . Freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment , Freddy 's Dead ( which was more entertaining than this was , actually ) , and then he would go on to bring down the mood in Freddy VS Jason , and finally he would putter out into nothing , which is for the best.<br /><br />I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now , but this movie is overall , horrible , and one of the worst movies ever made . Not recommended to anyone , and even ANOES completionists wo n't want to see this one again .
0 About twenty minutes into this movie , I was already bored . Quite simply , these characters were fairly dull . Occasionally , something enjoyable would happen , but then things would slow down again . Fortunately , my patience was eventually rewarded , and the ending to this movie was n't bad at all . However , it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes . So , I would say that the movie was mediocre overall , and considering all of the talent in the cast , I 'd call this a disappointment .
0 This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half - hour or so . None of them generate any interest or positive response . I waited for the intrigue to begin , hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end , but there was no reward for doing that.<br /><br />If you want a synopsis , look elsewhere . To me the action is n't worth recounting . Not that the story was that bad , I guess you could say I had some problems with the script -- i.e . I thought it stunk . A look at the credits will show you that there 's a pretty strong cast here , used to no avail . Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs ; of the actors I had n't seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger . That 's about all that I can find good to say about this picture .
0 I am glad to see most other people here do n't think much of this movie , either . It has some big names in the cast , but that 's it . There is nothing else to recommend , save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films.<br /><br />The story involves nothing but unlikable , self - centered , chain - smoking , " hip " characters that national film critics all seem to like .... and most of the public ca n't stand . < br /><br />The Oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable , the southern racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing .
0 This is a genuinely horrible film . The plot ( such as it is ) is totally undecipherable . ( I think it has something to do with blackmail , but I 'm not entirely certain.)<br /><br />Half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches . The other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of " southern " accents that ( thankfully ) the words can not be recognized.<br /><br />But the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as Mary Tyler Moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it.<br /><br / >
0 If you want to see a mystery , do n't watch this . Though there are elements straight out of Elmore Leonard territory , this comes closer to an episode of " Dynasty " , since the filmmaker focuses on " character development " - i.e. long , boring talks between stupid , un - involving characters . Some people can make fascinating movies without real action ( see " Exotica " ) , but not this one . Avoid it , especially if you like the actors involved in this one .
0 I have to admit , I do n't remember much about the characters or the story , though I 'm not sure there was one , I was soooo irritated by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it . How can you name a movie " Keys to Tulsa " and then film it in Texas ? The flat desert country around Arlington ( I think that was the location ) in no way resembles the green rolling hills around Tulsa , and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in . Obviously no one in the movie has EVER BEEN to Tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it . Had n't anyone at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders ? I know this sounds picky but I ca n't help it . I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting . But even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering , and mean story of self - involved people who are NOT IN TULSA ! ! I 'm sorry , it ca n't be more expensive to film in Oklahoma . What if " To Live and Die in LA " had been shot in Toronto ? Would that suck ? Well so does this .
0 Perhaps the biggest waste of production time , money and the space on the video store shelf . If someone suggests you see this movie , run screaming in the other direction . Unless , of course , you 're into self - abuse .
0 The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino , the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams , Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway , the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles , Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman , Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway ( older version ) , Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can ( successfully ) , do n't ask about Joanna Going . Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff . It delivers endless , meaningless dialog and very little action.<br /><br />Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies , an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely , sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright . Visit Tulsa , do n't watch this movie . It does n't do the location justice .
0 Saw it at UCSB 's reel loud festival and was * shocked * that it won the golden reel award . I was n't the only one , considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece . I thought there were many other better flicks out there , but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap . While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there , the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece . Seems as though " serious " student films need to include one of these categories : sex , intrapersonal struggle , and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three . Please , be more original!<br /><br />Oh , and it might be my outsider 's opinion , but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake . Does anyone else thing so ?
0 I have been familiar with the fantastic book of ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it . I have heard lots of positive remarks about this , so I had high hopes . Once this film had finished , I was horrified.<br /><br />This film is not a good film at all . ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out . Particularly , I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this . There was not much dialogue , It was rushed and far too fast - moving , but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down . The casting was not all that good , either . I thought this could have been really good , but it was so different to the book ! Anextremely poor adaption , one of the worst I 've seen . This deserves a decent remake that 'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage .
0 Goodnight , Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine . Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II . Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant , gruff old Tom ( who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold ) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is . In fact it 's just the old odd - couple buddy formula . Are n't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there 's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around . And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London 's citizens file politely into air - raid shelters . Even when the local schoolteacher 's husband is declared missing presumed killed , he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found ` Goodnight , Mister Tom ' cliched and obvious and John Thaw 's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his ` country bumpkin ' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow - imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br / >
0 I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of , and those I found made this one look unmissable . How misled I feel!<br /><br />Firstly , it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife 's daytime movie . The performances are wooden , every sentence is an attempt at ' poignant ' in the way that housewife 's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are , and it is based in that predictable and well - trodden premise that men ( particularly soldiers ) are essentially violent and incompassionate . The whole movie is about the ' drama ' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.<br /><br />If that sounds tolerable ( or even enjoyable ) to you , then be warned . Linda Hamilton 's German accent , while quite good , is painfully distracting - as is her face , for some reason . The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators , with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day . There are few surprises , but do watch for the ' Monty Pythonesque ' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers ' knapsacks!<br /><br />I was n't expecting action , but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged . What I got was a particularly bad Christmas ' feelgood ' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all.<br /><br />Watch it under the folowing circumstances : 1 : There 's nothing else on . 2 : You are a fan of predictable ' housewife takes on men and wins ' TV movies . 3 : The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film . 4 : You 've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling .
0 Slow , boring , extremely repetitive . No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy this . This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself , and quit producing . There is no way you can watch this and enjoy . The preacher is a joke . The whole idea is not funny . You can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature . I am so sorry I rented this movie . I will never watch anything with the name Spurlock on it . It is completely garbage . Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal . The film states that the American Consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products , making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy .
0 This film is just another distortion , among many distortions , on the so - called ' sins of consumerism ' . Please note that ' Reverend Billy ' , an actor ( Bill Talen ) , is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the ' sins of consumerism ' . We might want to ask are questions , like : What does ' Reverend Billy ' do for a living ? How does he make his money ? Does he make his living off his ' tax - deductible ' organization ? How does the Internal Revenue justify this as a ' tax - deductible ' church or organization ? < br /><br />Everyone knows that Christmas is commercialized , but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable , and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . Everyone is not charitable . Everyone does not spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . But , holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity . Yes , America does have more than its share of problems -- but , with perseverance , Americans have and always make it through great difficulties . And , even in times of strife , America has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world . That happens when Americans pull together and unite , rather than to separate and divide . Yes , there are problems with corporations and monopolies , but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses , along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities . Yes , globalization has brought us its share of problems , but it will take Americans to bring production back to America . Americans and the U.S. government need to learn how to stay on a budget , no matter how large or small it may be , and we must stop our dependence on credit . Our over - reliance on credit will make , and keep us poor , from the cradle to the grave . It is important to buy -- but , if we buy less , we will rely less on credit . And , if we are able to save , even a small amount of money , we will have money for a rainy day . Not to say that , as Americans , we will gain an equal share of wealth . Wealth is not guaranteed , and has never been guaranteed . But , stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans hold most of America 's wealth . There is a good proximity that you or I can reach the level of the upper , middle class . And , who knows what can happen from there ? ! ? Be positive , work hard -- and , at the very least , you and I will be able to reach at least some ( if not all ) of our dreams . In life , nothing is guaranteed , but we always have that something to reach for . And , if you or I do n't have dreams , we might as well be dead . In America , there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams . As individuals , we are a part of the pack , but we always can become the leader of the pack.<br /><br />It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions , but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs , values , and perspectives . But , as far as the distortions expressed , within this film , I do not have any faith in such beliefs , values , and perspectives . I rank this film with a 1 out of 10 - -but , in all honesty and truth , this film deserves a zero . This film has no integrity , and I can not recommend it .
0 the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable , but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it . keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production " i bet you will " that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production " supersize me " i did not had my hopes up high . sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less . as with " supersize me " after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was . the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re - repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie , so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end .
0 Even if you subscribe to the knee - jerk anti - free - trade politics of this movie , it is still just the same tired note , played again and again and again . Clink clink clink . Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles , the Reverend Billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure . The clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on TV before he climbs back into bed that night . He has a pretty wife , I have to admit , but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie . The interminable bus rides are the worst part -- with progress shown -- can you guess ?-- by a colored line moving across a map . Aww , you guessed . Oh well , it has the virtue of being short . Is that the only favorable thing I can say ? Hmmmm . Yep , afraid so .
0 This British pot - boiler has one thing going for it : the young men are uniformly good looking . The older men are opinionated , right - wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan / Thatcher years . Young or old , however , morals in this three - part mini - series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well.<br /><br />Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford . It is not pivotal to the story , but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier . Nick comes to London with a friend , whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician , and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France . They neglect to inform him that , when upset , Cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements . Nick mistakes their self - serving ' gratitude ' for affection and moves in , finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him . Inexplicably , Nick lives in this house for four years but , as the plot depends on this point , it 's best not to question it.<br /><br />While Nick is most pleasing to look at , he is unbearably obsequious . His coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls . Deeply closeted except to Cat ( she guesses his big secret on sight ) , he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay . Though it hardly seems possible , Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he.<br /><br />Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film , so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nick 's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid . Gerald , in true Tory fashion , has become involved in several personal and financial scandals , so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment . This gives Gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy.<br /><br />Except for one brief moment of indignation , Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement . Denial , self - loathing , naiveté , or ignorance ? You decide , if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set .
0 I decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the BBC in the weeks prior to it starting . I watched it despite the fact that I do n't like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes ( sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor 's new clothes with this author 's work ) . I admit that the acting is excellent , it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production . The ' explicit ' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV - several times - so it was nothing very shocking I 'm afraid . Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline / content I 'm afraid .
0 Perhaps I could n't find the DVD menu selection for PLOT : ON OFF . Clearly , the default is OFF . When the end credits began to roll , I could n't believe that was it . Like our poor , but beautiful protagonist , I felt used , dirty , cheap .... <br /><br />The characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writer 's disdain for wealthy Thatcherites was all to apparent . I consider myself a " Roosevelt Democrat " , but would appreciate a bit more subtlety.<br /><br />Of course , the problem could be with me . I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture . Alas , not I. < br /><br />The only thing that kept me from giving this a " 1 " was the nice scenery , human and plant .
0 So far after week two of " The lone of Beauty " I am a little disappointed.<br /><br />Some of the acting is good , as long as we except that it is only drama.<br /><br />I am unsure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is " factual " coverage of the " Thatcher " years - it is okay as drama , but I feel the award winning book is still much better.<br /><br />I Wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with " Things Can Only Get Better " finishing with 2006 and the Fact that we are still waiting ! with that promise from a Government that is full of sleaze .
0 Italian horror / suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn . You know he must have really loved his wife , because he brings them to his home - a huge , rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them , whips them , and kills them . The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film 's end , we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film . Anyway , soon , under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera , De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle 's party . She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe 's fragile state of mind . He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally , well , just look at the title if you are still curious . Also , family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions . Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old ) meets her fate in a foxy fashion . Another man is injected and then buried alive . And of course , there is a whole explanation as to why / how Evelyn did what she did . Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well : the settings in the film are well - suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best . None of the actors look English . Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman would n't be caught dead in . The cars drive on their wrong side of the road . But all that notwithstanding , the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too . And of course any film with the sultry , red - headed Erika Blanc is always a plus . There is a streak of sexual perversion ; however , which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons . C'mon .
0 This Italian semi - horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good , that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes . The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film . The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon , go berserk and seemingly kill them . They show the nudity , but they never really show the murders at this point in the film . Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her . He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one , she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience 's business . After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes , foxes and such . At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely . This movie just did not work for me , it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film . Explaining Evelyn 's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave . Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave , just not under her own power . The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too . I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull .
0 Wealthy widower Anthony Steffen ( as Alan Cunningham ) is a sadomasochistic lover , and British Lord . He brings sexy red - haired women to his castle , where he whips and murders them . Black - booted stripper Erika Blanc ( as Susie ) gets away , temporarily . Mr. Steffen is haunted by wife " Evelyn " , who died in childbirth . As therapy , he decides to marry again , after meeting pretty blonde Marina Malfatti ( as Gladys ) . By the end of the movie , they will have had to dig a few more graves . " The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave " is great title , at least.<br /><br / > * * La notte che Evelyn uscì dalla tomba ( 1971 ) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen , Marina Malfatti , Erika Blanc
0 Alan ( Anthony Steffen ) , an English multi - millionaire with a few screws loose ( thanks to his first wife 's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth ) , entices sexy , red - headed women to his castle , offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend . Once back at his ancestral pile , he gets them nekkid , proceeds to flog them with a bull - whip , and then kills them.<br /><br />But when he meets blonde hottie Gladys ( Marina Malfatti ) and falls for her ample charms , he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married . Their wedded bliss is short - lived , however , thanks to Alan 's iffy mental state , which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife Evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds.<br /><br />So let 's recap : a groovy 70s Euro - horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress ; spooky Gothic retreats and misty graveyards ; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop - dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods ; several vicious murders ( including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes ) . Normally , a checklist like that would guarantee me a good timeso why did I find ' The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave ' so dull ? Well , for starters , the plot is way too convoluted : there are red herrings , crazy plot developments , and suspects galore , and it all becomes a bit too much . By the ridiculous endingin which we discover that , all along , several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on Alan 's wealth , and that our red - head killing nut - job is actually supposed to be the hero of the moviemy head was hurting too much to care ! Secondly , Emilio Maraglia 's direction is pretty torpid . Stylish , yes ; but as slow as molasses at times.<br /><br />And then there 's the bits that are just too damn silly , possibly even for a giallo : the death by poisonous snake bite ( surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever ) ; Alan 's Aunt Agatha , an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman ; the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids ; the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in England ( mentioning ' pounds ' and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough ) ; and then , of course , there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool ... <br /><br />'The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave ' is n't a total waste of time ( how could it be , with so much female flesh on show ? ) , but there are much better giallo 's out there . Watch this one if you 're a fan of the genre and you 've already seen the bestbut do n't expect too much .
0 Lord Alan Cunningham(Antonio De Teffè)is a nutjob{seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum } , with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin , likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife Evelyn , a woman who betrayed him for another man , with those red locks . This nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring . He , however , is overrun by his obsession with his late wife 's memory(specifically her adultery .. he saw her naked with the lover ) . While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence , Alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with Gladys(Marina Malfatti , who spends most of the film naked .. that 's probably her lone attribute since she is n't a very good actress ) , who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away{there 's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth}.<br /><br />The only real person Alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital , Dr. Richard Timberlane(Giacomo Rossi - Stuart ) . There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan . Alan 's cousin , George(Rod Murdock ) , seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims .. I mean dates , while holding onto hope of getting his lord 's estate some day . Albert(Roberto Maldera ) , Evelyn 's brother , is a witness to Alan 's slaughter and , instead of turning him into the police , squeezes him for cash . Aunt Agatha(Joan C Davis ) , wheelchair bound , lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors . We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert.<br /><br />All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan , someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan , and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing.<br /><br />The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married , where is Evelyn 's body , and will Alan go over the edge ? I have to be honest and say I just did n't really care much for this film . It 's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place . It looks great on the new DVD and the " rising from the grave sequence " is cool , but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable . You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity . He can be quite volatile . Who commits the crime really is n't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off , there are n't but a choice few who could be doing it . What happens to Alan does n't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he 's just getting what he deserves . Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan , as I pointed out before , are n't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances( .. or advantages they 'd have)that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan 's sanity , then everything just comes off less than stellar . I thought the editing was choppy and unexciting , but the acting from the entire cast is really below par . Some stylistics help and there is a sniff of Gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some .
0 THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE ( Emilio Miraglia - Italy 1971).<br /><br />I only watched this delirious piece of Euro - tosh in the way of Alpha Video 's dreadful DVD - release ( looks like an extremely bad video - transfer ) , but from what I saw , not nearly interesting enough to purchase No Shame 's recent DVD - release . Considering their excellent track record , it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases . And do n't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here , it 's not taken from this film ( some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey look - a - like).<br /><br />Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham , a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn . This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic . Once released , Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle , subjecting them to vicious acts of torture . His doctor and friend , Richard Timberlane ( what do you mean , Italian horror names sound " made up ? " ) , advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a séance at the castle . Eventually , after killing some more girls , he meets Gladys , another redhead , and marries her almost immediately , but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events . Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alan 's family , killing them off one by one . Becoming more distraught , Cunningham visits Evelyn 's tomb and discovers it to be empty . Soon , a number of " outsiders " begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunningham 's treatment might not have been that successful after all.<br /><br />Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success . As usual , not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England . The cars drive on the right side of the road , everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle ( and the rest of the architecture ) is patently Italian . This is common practice in Italian horror , but sometimes they just take this a little too far . The bad print made this even slightly bearable , since it 's so dark , you could n't see much of the surroundings anyway . But , then again , this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality is n't really the issue . A large part consists of sado - masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber , but most of the time , Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over - acting . I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you 're in the right mood . I just could n't take it , at least not with the print I watched . A pleasant score though by Bruno Nicolai which combines easy - listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 4/10
0 Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words . The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end , alive and well , only to be massacred again . There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on . The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film . I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a ' Euro - trash , sexy horror flick . ' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out . All the good stuff more than likely . I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new ' Planet of the Apes ' movie . Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff . You 'll need it .
0 * SOILER * It 's fake ! The whole thing is a fake ! There is no ghosts or zombies , Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself . So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY - DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide . Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them . He 's not even killing them . He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace . If he looked at the so - called ghost of Evelyn , he could tell she was wearing gloves ! My God what a waste of time . Do n't bother watching it , renting and if you bought it and have n't watched it yet , sell it . Quickly ! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE . I give this stinker the CRAP - O - LANTERN .
0 Oh , those Italians ! Assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes , castles drowned in gothic atmosphere , and back - stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all ! If you 've seen one film of this type , you 've basically seen them all ( the MST3 K favorite " Screaming Skull " fits the mold , too) ... and " The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave " is formulaic , by - the - numbers , and dull as hell . Even the luscious Erika Blanc is put to waste here.<br /><br />zero/10<br /><br / >
0 A great slasher movie -- too bad it was the producers and not part of the script . Basic plot summary - man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success . Only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as I did and chopped the heck out of the movie . Nothing flows , you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time ( did n't he off that one earlier ? ? ) , and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke . Not that I can blame him I passed out 2 - 3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist . Warning when you see the ending DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happens before -- you will just get an aneurysm . Not worth the time , effort , or God forbid money . Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that I watched .
0 This movie is an embarrassment to film - making . I ca n't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny . Not only was the script atrocious , but the casting people should be shot . Gail O'Grady is just a great actress , but beyond that ... % 99 of the rest of the cast ... ouch . Pretty much everyone else ... wow it is hard to even ... wow . Here is the number one rule about comedy " DON'T TRY TO BE FUNNY " . There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this film . Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film - making in Canada . I realize this is technically a " US " film , but look at the director , actors , location , etc . I just saw this on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film . Again , there are a lot of great films out there that ca n't get airtime and they show this crap .
0 Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing " Apocalypse Now " that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie ? < br /><br />You have to wonder what the director of " The Godfather " and " The Conversation " was thinking when he made this flabby film . It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle , playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her , and Turner , the trooper that she is , does what she can with it , but this movie could n't be saved by anyone.<br /><br />It does n't even have any style to it , and , given its director , one would expect that even if it had nothing else , it would have that.<br /><br />Grade : C-
0 I wondered why I did n't like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did , when it first came out in 1986 , with all the hype . Somehow I found Nic Cage 's character off - putting . Way off - putting . Then the plot did n't seem to make sense . Then by the end of the credits , the question came to mind : What point was this movie making ? What was it saying ? The answer , unfortunately , was not much , if anything . I really do n't think this movie aimed at making a statement ; unless it was " your life is your life , you 're gon na make the same mistakes no matter what , so keep your eye upon the doughnut , and not the hole " . Not a very profound statement , and I 'm sorry , not profoundly made in this movie . The writing simply is n't that good . The direction is uneven , and is strangely overblown at times . Kathleen Turner was the best , and in my opinion , only worthwhile thing in this movie , and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre , unexplained circumstances , with a script that had no apparent statement to make . < br /><br />She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I did n't enjoy this movie more . She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola 's direction every step of the way , doing it " his own way " ( not a good idea for a new actor ) , and putting on a goofy voice she called " stupid " . His voice was annoying , abrasive and unnatural , and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy . I understand what he was attempting to do : play a young - guy " hot shot " who is not as hot as he thinks he is , setting up his own karma for future failure . But he goes overboard , the way he does it is abrasive , not effective , and if he had listened to his uncle instead of " fighting the Man " , we would have had a more enjoyable film . Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person , and those scenes are more watchable than others . But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety , I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected ( put - on ) scenes . < br /><br />The movie does n't aim for a statement , does n't make a point , is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression ( but without the voice ) , and is , ultimately , confusing and a waste of time . Given all this , Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie . I ca n't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this , unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes . Believe me , you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes , and it will make just as much sense . < br /><br />Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments , which proves that she 's strong enough to be honest , and to hell with other people 's comments . You go , Turner ! I 'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first - rate actor or actress , but her candor is refreshing . Cage 's acting can be good to annoying , and here it does n't work . At least , in this film , now we know why .
0 Seriously , there is absolutely NOTHING good about this crap fest at all . Randolph Scott , a closet homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years , is at his most wooden and boring in the least role . At 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles , although it does n't matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking . Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role but it is n't enough to save this garbage . Thank God they do n't make westerns any more , they 're just dated , racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder.<br /><br />0/10 .
0 I knew I was going to see a low budget movie , but I expected much more from an Alex Cox film . The acting by the two leading men was terrible , especially the white guy . The girl should have won an Oscar compared to those two . This movie was filled with what I guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud , which is rare . Without these laugh - out - loud moments I would have given this film 2/10 . What happened to the Alex Cox who made all the 80s classics?<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />There were a couple of questions I had after the movie was over . Why did the Mexican guy go to the other guy 's house at the beginning ? What did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job ? Why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him ? I guess I should have gone to the Q&A after the movie , but I did n't want to get up at 10 am .
0 Although there were some amusing moments , I thought the movie was pretty lame . The longer it ran , the worse it got . Once the action entered Monument Valley , I found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters.<br /><br />The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent . First she 's in on the deal , then discovers the truth and she bails . Then she 's back again , then deserts them again . Then she 's back again . There 's no apparent motivation for any of her decisions . There were interesting characters , some interesting scenes , and many missed possibilities . I would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts . Apparently the people who liked Repo Man were inclined to like this one . Searchers 2.0 is no match for The Searchers .
0 Jeez , only in the 70 's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure - hunt . The spices of this trashy co - production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian one - off company include humorous storytelling , off - the - wall happenings and some very tame T&A. Extra campy moments are being served by Lee Van Cleef 's obnoxious wig , leather - clad bible - thumping psycho gunman Yancey Hobbitt ( loveably hammed up by Julian Ugarte , the man who should 've done way more obscure European genre productions than he did ) , wanna - be - witty dialogue , hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events ( especially every jump made by Lo Lieh).<br /><br />While this little piece of action falls fare and square into the Turkey Territory , it 's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen , and you ca n't deny the charisma of this duo . Do n't expect too much , and you 'll get plenty out of it.<br /><br />This is my truth . What is yours ?
0 what kind of sh*t is this ? Power rangers vs Freddy ? It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams , it started to become childish . This sh*t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film . The rest are for little kids . Plus it 's focused too much on Christianity . I know Freddy 's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons . Why does it always have to be Christianity ? This is total Orientalism and filled with white men / westerner 's superiority . Do n't ' watch this , show it to little kids who loves power rangers .
0 Unless I 'm sadly mistaken , I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video , I 'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors , at the end of it , and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I 've ever seen . It 's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now , but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos . There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits , and they 're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes . What could make a rap group look more foolish I ca n't imagine.<br /><br />(spoilers ) At any rate , I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version , so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series . The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2 , with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands . Kristen Parker ( Patricia Arquette ) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in , then runs to the bathroom , the sink 's handles turn into Freddy 's hands and attack her , and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists . From there , the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment . < br /><br />`Larry ' Fishburne , tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles , was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice - guy orderly , stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little . Not surprisingly , he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie . Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor , but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film . The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists . All of them are cynical and uncooperative , almost none believing that they really belong there at all . Eventually , they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it 's not just some kind of group hysteria.<br /><br />Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson , this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger . Not surprisingly , she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients , since she had experienced exactly what they 're going through . There are some interesting murders in this installment , and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump . There is a gigantic , worm - like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole , there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV , but there is also an unconvincing go - motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger 's skeleton , which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard . And one of the more groan - inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream ( the one famous for sleepwalking ) , tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet . Ouch.<br /><br />We get a peek into Freddy 's past in this installment . Not only do we meet his mother , but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs . In fighting Freddy , the patients all band together and , in their dreams , use their special powers ( most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life ) to fight him . One student , bound to a wheelchair , is able to walk in his dreams , another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the ` Wizard Master , ' another is ` beautiful and bad ' ( she has lots of makeup , her hair stands up in a foot - high Mohawk , and she has knives ) . Clever , but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients , the one who ca n't speak , not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie , when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams ( at just the right moment to save the day ) . His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long , but collectively , now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.<br /><br />Altogether , this is not an entirely weak entry into the series . The acting is pretty shoddy , but it 's actually pretty good for a horror movie . Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast , displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career , and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two  a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films . The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension , which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we 've come to know and root for their triumph over evil . But then again , not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed , or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives . But it 's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones 
0 This UK psychological thriller is known in the United States as CLOSURE . Exploitation of X - Files ' Gillian Anderson , who plays an attractive middle aged businesswoman of substance named Alice .

0 I was really looking forward to watching this , being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress . The beginning was interesting . I liked the relationship between the two stars . It then quickly jumps to the main plot , which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped . They then decide to go for some revenge . Sounds good , right ? Well , it 's not . The story gets boring and side - tracked , and certain things get really weird . I wo n't give out any details , but things happen that I , for one , have no desire to see . I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt , and I really wanted to like this one . It just did n't work out . I give it a 3 out of 10 , mainly for the acting .
0 Although I use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what I think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films , after watching this " movie " on Film Four last night I felt compelled to write something down , even if it just helps cleanse me once again.<br /><br />The film was possibly the shallowest experience I 've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer ( 23 ? You sure ? ) and Gillian Anderson ( who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock ) had no real substance about them - I 'm not sure if the first half - hour of the film did n't make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims ... here I could n't care less . In fact , the only character I did seem to care about was the dog , with the stag coming a close second . And both animals out - acted Dire ( sic ) and Scully , who were quite frankly terrible . I guess though you 're only as good as the script you are given , and I 'd like to warmly thank the writers , the producers , the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity .
0 An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two - dimensional psycho thugs during a night - time encounter on a forest road in Shropshire , England . The man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers ... <br /><br />Utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash , somehow masquerading as ' thought - provoking ' drama , whilst actually coming across as sub - Michael Winner cr*p ( you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s ) . What happens to Alice ( Gillian Anderson ) and Adam ( Danny Dyer ) is appalling and devastating , yet Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer 's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness . His camera lingers hungrily on Anderson 's naked body both during and after the assault , whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional cliché . His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the ' victims ' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces ( Adams 's attempted post - incident assaults on both Sophie and Alice ; Alice 's assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide - attempt confession).<br /><br />The quandary comes from the central protagonists ' performances - Dyer is a horrible actor , incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault ( he 'll end up in Eastenders , mark my words ) , but Anderson is extraordinary . Even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways , she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self - indulgent , arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate.<br /><br />A vile and pointless film then , almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance .
0 This movie is the worst I 've seen in the last 5 years . It is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash . The film is rape / beating and revenge genre . Couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes . He did n't go to their car , instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped . Then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenario ! Bellow Hollywood ! He was against that revenge but " She is raped " " They laugh to her " so she must kill them all ... But once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle 's top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy . Personally I think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang - rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money . LoL This movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they wo n't see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by British cinematography which I personally like and that is the reason I 've watched this . Do n't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film ...
0 This reminded me SOO much of Michael Winner 's crappy ' Dirty Weekend ' with it 's awful English low budget feel.<br /><br />Firstly I must say I am a fan of both exploitation and serious film . I appreciate , say , ' Demented ' for it 's ineptitude and ' Last House on the Left ' for it 's sheer unashamed brutality . And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spin offs.<br /><br />This was just pointless though . Kind of like a British budget director thought ' let 's remake " I Spit on your Grave " without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with Hostel.<br /><br />The whole thing just does n't hang together or have a point . What 's with the rapists 's daughter ? Why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras ? Crappy .
0 This is the biggest load of crap that I have seen in a long time . The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching " 28 Days later " and " Magnolia " . There is absolutely no point to this movie , except to see some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes , Gillian Anderson relieving herself on the side of the road , and every single sentence of dialog having to use the " F " word at least a couple of times in it . It has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget . My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour . We had tried to give it a chance , but nothing could save this crud . DO NOT WATCH IT ! ! !
0 A truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so I could stand . Not the actors ' fault , but the writer / director , producers , financiers , etc . , need a very stiff talking to . Maybe it thinks it is profound . It is n't . This rape and ultra - violence , unlike that central to Clockwork Orange , has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding . It 's no Straw Dogs , either , to which I have seen it compared . Rather it feels like something Pete Walker might have turned his hand to , yet even in saying that I 'm probably being a bit unfair on Pete Walker.<br /><br />Revenge is a powerful human desire , but The Bedroom Window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort.<br /><br />I do n't think it 's particularly misogynistic , merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details -- the blood running down GA 's leg post rape , par example . It 's neither challenging nor confrontational , though I 'm sure the film - makers consider themselves very ' daring ' , just deeply unpleasant.<br /><br />Is this as high as we can aim ? Is this why those involved wanted to make films ? ( I did write in here the Latin phrase which translates as Oh the Times ! Oh the customs ! But the new spell - check on IMDb would n't let me post until I had removed it . Likewise I had to remove square parentheses . Get it sorted IMDb.)<br /><br />Where is the lofty aspiration ? The noble impulse ? When you look at British film - the joyful comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers ; Carol Reed 's work with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol , Our Man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man ( a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads ) ; the work of Powell & Pressburger ; or if you want to talk about sex , violence and male emasculation look at " The Offence ' Dir . Sidney Lumet , from an original play by John Hopkins ; check out " Tunes of Glory " for something worth making , that has something to say.<br /><br />Unlike the foregoing , Straightheads is , alas , an altogether hateful waste of celluloid .
0 I 'd been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much . I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately it just did n't work for me.<br /><br />The problem lies in the fact that the film does n't really seem to understand which genre it 's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama , horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it 's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none.<br /><br />The premise ( as with most revenge films ) is simple , couple meet and go out , something bad happens and they get their revenge it 's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years . Unfotunately in this case it 's as if Dan Reed thought , " It 'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail .... " Wrong ! There are also a few key elements missing , in this type of movie there 's generally some kind of warning . A do n't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there 's nothing of the sort here . It just simply happens , then nothing happens for an hour , then something interesting happens and then it ends.<br /><br />There 's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to Dan Reed for trying , I have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing ... I 'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he 's making instead of trying to be too clever and he 'll have a quality movie on his hands .
0 Well where to start here ? Straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma . Had this film come out of Italy in , say , 1975 , been directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starred David Hess , then I 'd be lapping it up faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer 's day . Because whilst Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema , Dan Reed has produced a rape / revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in England , and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken Rodriguez to turn Rose McGowan 's leg into a machine gun . Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo , then let me call out the ' numbers ' : < br /><br />1 . Rich , high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and , equally implausibly , gets the hots for him . Check.<br /><br />2 . Gratuitous shots of said high - flying career woman in various states of nudity . Check.<br /><br />3 . Convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who can not be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in . Check.<br /><br />4 . Unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape . Check.<br /><br />5 . Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off . Bingo ! < br /><br />Plotwise , Straightheads is pretty basic stuff : Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss . On the way home , they upset three locals in a Landover who take their revenge by giving Dyer a good shoeing and gang raping Anderson . The couple then set about getting their revenge . So far , so " Straw Dogs " , " Late Night Trains " , " House on the Edge of the Park " , " I Spit On Your Grave " etc etc . So why did n't I think much of this film ? A number of reasons : I suppose first off , having the likes of Gillian Anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better , but it 's the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most.<br /><br />Because whenever anyone sits down to watch Hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70 's , then they always know exactly what they are getting - low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator . The baddies terrorise and murder the goodies , the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back , and everyone goes home satisfied , their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored.<br /><br />As writer and director however , Dan Reed clearly believes Straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that , and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there . For instance , when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge on their attackers , they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen - year - old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with . When Anderson finally meets him face to face , he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter ! ! ! The casual and audacious way that Reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw - dropping , it 's almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience 's moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they 've just sat through something of significance . To make sure we ' get it ' , at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time , ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter , but Reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of Anderson rough - handled and raped across the bonnet of her car . Gratuitous does not enter into it.<br /><br />After being told his reasons for raping her , Anderson ties him over a table , rams the business end of a sniper rifle ( complete with bulky silencer , just in case anyone was n't clear on the phallic imagery ) up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger , telling Dyer ( who has no such moral qualms ) that ' it 's over ' . Dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms back at Cambridge over tea and cakes . It is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness.<br /><br />In fairness , Ms Anderson acts her guts out throughout the film . It 's obvious she wants to leave Scully far behind and , bless her , she certainly does that ; one wonders what Mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun ? Dyer , on the other hand , does what he 's done in virtually every film he 's made to date - that is , plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin , a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching . This is particularly true at the closing scene where , after murdering his assailants in cold blood , Dyer gazes at the camera in , what I 'm sure is meant to be , a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome , but instead is far more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after Stan has landed him in yet another fine mess . Which incidentally , sums up this film quite nicely .
0 Gillian Anderson is an arrogant , driven , career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun . After a stupid accident in the countryside , they are brutally attacked . After recovering , and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers , their thoughts turn to that of revenge ... <br /><br />I thought " Straightheads " was terrible . Violent , brutal , misogynistic and unpleasant . If I did n't dislike the phrase a great deal I would call " Straightheads " a video nasty . Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980 's . Frankly I do n't know how " Straightheads " got a cinema release.<br /><br />I am not a prude . I do n't mind sex and violence in the movies , but they have to be married to a movie with a ) a good plot or b ) good characterisation or c ) preferably both . " Straightheads " had neither . No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid . Luckily " Straightheads " went nowhere fast . It was only 80 minutes long.<br /><br />It was a shame , because there was the germ of an interesting film here , with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third . How often do I say this , but it could have been good if it had been done properly . What a shame . I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer , but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film . She , especially , is very underrated ( and is still particularly fit).<br /><br />If you want to see a good British revenge movie , rent or buy Shane Meadows ' " Dead Man 's Shoes " . It is a little masterpiece . Last weekend I should have seen his " This Is England " instead . Ce sera sera ...
0 * WARNING * Contains MANY SPOILERS!<br /><br />Let me start by saying I have a huge respect for Gillian Anderson 's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress - which is why I can not comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script ( or lack thereof . ) < br /><br />The premise of the film was , in my opinion , a great idea and there were some genuinely thought - provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé . It exemplifies why I hate 99 % of British cinema . It feels too long , it 's tedious , for the most part , and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes . Just when you think there 's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon . With little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot , there is n't much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn . As for the script I can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees , with the average scene reading something along the lines of " Alice : F * * * OFF ! ( Adam stares . Adam runs off into woods)(Alice follows ) Alice : ADAM ! ADAM ! " I suspect that , word for word , the actors probably got paid more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile adverts . What few lines there were did n't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f - word that would make Bridget Jones 's friend , Shazza , proud . There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic ' Oh that 's terrible ' reaction.<br /><br />Alice is n't the kind of woman who courts sympathy either . She 's got a great job , an expensive London apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited , bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst . After the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort - of explain why she is this way to start with ; she grew up with a tough - as - old - boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so , instead of following in his footsteps , she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living . Instead she found a group of stereotypical middle - class Toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system ( i.e. becoming Mrs Robinson to a wanna - be Cockney wide - boy electrician ) Someone pass me a tissue . The one saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson . In the hands of a lesser actress she would 've been intolerably one - dimensional but Ms Anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being , most notably when she 's sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault.<br /><br />I ca n't say that Adam fared much better either . Danny Dyer played him well as a fish - out - of - water Jack the Lad but a good performance could n't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background . < br /><br />This film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end . As for the shock , the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become ; it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes . On a side note , only in a British film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on - talk about stiff - upper - lip taken to the extreme ! If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery is donating money to make then I 'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week . < br /><br />Saying that I hated this film is giving it too much credit , I did n't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion . I want that one - and - a - bit hours of my life back , please !
0 If derivative and predictable rape - revenge thrillers are your thing , then you 're in for a rare treat ... They do n't really appeal to me , so I could n't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale . It seems like something straight out of the 1980s , a different age when this would have gone straight to video . Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario . But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year ? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near - rape and by his work on documentaries , but even that 's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer . I do n't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing . What I ca n't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures . Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years . Verve distributed Bullet Boy , Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads does n't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath . FilmFour and Verve take note : is this really the best you can do ? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement ? It 's a big blot on both of your reputations . Listen carefully : can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair ?
0 I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it , even though we had heard from a mutual friend how " great it was".<br /><br />Now , I am pretty conservative in my views , but I knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it . I figured before the movie started Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses , and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist . But I thought that s where the political statement would begin and end.<br /><br />OK , the plot was solid : Single president falls for a lobbyist . OK , this has potential I thought to be pretty entertaining , since the plot was unique . But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial . The movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the President and Sydney(Annette Bening).<br /><br />There were several ridiculous premises in this movie : 1 ) The character Sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a " closer " . Could she have been more flighty ? She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything . Hardly a " closer " . I am an sales , and she could not " close " selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst.<br /><br />2 ) Secondly , is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic ? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue . Give me a break . I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible.<br /><br />3 ) The speech at the end was simply ludicrous . The line about " I am a proud card carrying member of the ACLU " was a joke . First , no president would ever admit something like that , being an active member of an ultra fringe group . Second , why even bring something like that up . You just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative.<br /><br />I thought the plot was great and unique . I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president . But the movie went from being a " movie " to a left wing political statement , which is why the movie failed.<br /><br />Its a shame to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
0 The plot is so manipulative , counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision . The children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as I say , the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots , and therefore in THAT case , making more sense out of their actions ( and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust ) . Why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore ? How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the LAST place to be searched ? Why would the 2 boys NEVER be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched ? There is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this . Asking to believe it would then do to trial ( even the informal setting ) is too insulting to bare .
0 In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations , managed many pro wrestlers ( including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars ) , worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs and did voice - overs and commentary for many wrestling DVD 's . I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity , lack of talent and skill , and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling . To even list this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an outright misuse of the term . Shot with low - dollar video cameras , it 's essentially home videos of kids play - fighting in back yards . The sound quality is bad , the video quality is bad , and the acting is horrendous . The " wrestlers " wear makeshift costumes with hand - drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves . Sometimes the " matches " are on the grass . Sometimes on a back yard trampoline . ALL are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill . In short , do n't bother with this stinker . Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic ( both in my case ) , you will be terribly disappointed .
0 Yeah , unfortunately I came across the DVD of this and found that it was incredibly awful.<br /><br />First of all , the characters suck . I mean , come on , if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself ' Orange Sherbert ' is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character , then they should definitely not be in the film - making scene . Poor " costumes " , bad " interviews " , and basically there is not one " wrestler " on this whole disc with any shred of charisma.<br /><br />The " wrestling " in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline . They make sure to giggle together all the while , too , making the experience seem more like a toddler 's playtime than a " wrestling deathmatch".<br /><br />Basically , Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty lackluster Backyard Wrestling clone . Only , instead of blood , weapons , mayhem , and WRESTLING , we get a trampoline , giggling kids , TERRIBLE audio , and some guy called Orange Sherbert.<br /><br />Wrestling fan or not , avoid this DVD . It 's awful .
0 Whoever wrote the " nice " post about this must have been a friend of these guys . This is bad even for backyard wrestling . In fact this is n't even backyard wrestling really , it 's a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline . Each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this . It is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name , if that is possible . If you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling , pick up Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain . It stars the 2 biggest names in BYW , MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition . These guys are good . They have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as " real " pro wrestlers . They went legit and have gotten better . I recommend checking out those 2 guys . MDogg is insane and off the hook . So do n't waste your time or your cash on this crappy DVD , there are " better " back yard videos out there .
0 < br /><br />The movie starts out as an ordinary comic - hero - movie . It´s about the boy who is picked on , has no parents and is madly in love with the schools # 1 girl . Nothing surprises in the movie , there is nothing that you can´t guess coming in the movie . Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one . Maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest . You can´t get away from thinking of movies like X - men , Batman and Spawn . All of those titles are better . I almost walked out the last 20 minutes ! One thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation , BUT not even that is anything to put in the christmas - tree ! So my recomendation : Don´t see this film even if you get paid for it !
0 I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I 'd seen , " Burning Moon " . But while that movie was rather grim and nasty , " Premutos " seems to mostly play it for laughs . While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time ( and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this ) , I found myself constantly battling not to fast - forward to the next gore scene . Sure , there 's gore , and if that 's all you want then go ahead and enjoy . But be warned : there 's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition . Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson 's movies , especially " Braindead " . But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in " Bad Taste " , it 's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent . 3/10 ( for pretty good and plentiful gore effects , and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it )
0 Simply terrible ! Why would n't you use actual actors ? Look , this has to stop ! Stop using non - actors ! If you want any credibility or any message sent via these low - budget films ... please for the love of god use real actors ! Most will work for free ... take advantage of that ! Now back to my comment ... anyway , the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and was n't funny on any level . As for the quality ... in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what ? It was one guy with what looked like a Sony Camcorder and probably not even his . Well , I assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish ... and it was n't even good gore .
0 Pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult , who fights them sixteen years later . The man has a child with one of the other cultists , who during a raid by the police is hidden away , and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river . The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town . It 's hard to keep track of who characters are , or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place . The leader gets paroled sixteen years later ( I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie ) . Nobody is made to look any older , not noticeably , anyway.<br /><br />One murder is done with a large circular logging saw , others are done with knives or a crossbow . I never heard the title character 's name mentioned in the movie , but he 's the one who overacts the most , hooting and hollering.<br /><br />The movie is patched together pretty poorly , with voice - over helping ( not much ) to explain what is going on . Some of the sound effects were pretty bad . A man is getting punched , and we hear the sound of a whip cracking . A woman fires a gun , and we do n't hear it fire , but hear a ricochet instead ! It does n't seem to have been done for comical effect .
0 " Igor and the Lunatics " is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy - hippie - cult - killing - spree horror movie . Apparently even nearly twenty years later , Charles Manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash - filmmakers . This is a typical Troma production , meaning in other words , there 's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot . There 's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which is n't bad  but it 's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at . " Igor and the Lunatics " is so desperate that it 's even using a lot of the footage twice , like the circle saw killing for example . The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug - addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul . One of Paul 's lower ranked disciples , named Igor , becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity . Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is : he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch - hiker girl ! There 's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo - artistic camera tricks , like slow - motion footage and lurid dream sequences . Maybe there 's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that ' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete . For no particular reason , the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds .
0 First off , the title character is not even the main character of the movie . He is the sidekick of the cult leader . The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud , laughing hysterically , and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people . Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling ( because he never actually just spoke ) in a high pitched voice . He would also say idiotic one - liners . For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw , Igor upon seeing this , yells out " Paul ! No Paul ! Why 'd you do it ? I could have cut her clean ! So clean ! " In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to ' get her own tools for surgery because right now , it was his time to operate . ' Aside from the bad acting , the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax , which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed , he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining ' good guys ' . The movie offers no explanation of this , only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital . What ? ? ? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie . I wish I could get back the moments I lost watching this .
0 This movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever . It really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made . But , if you can stand the mind - numbing plot , character development , and direction , you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny . The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable . Someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie . If you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already ( I feel your pain ) then these words have come too late . For anyone else , Stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life . Then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it .
0 i did n't enjoy this movie at all.for one , i just found it crude and vulgar , for no reason.i also felt it 's misogynistic(against women.)also , the movie really does n't appear to be about anything , and i did n't find any of the characters likable.really,the there does n't seem to be any point to it all.maybe i 'm missing something , but for me , this movie is pretty much a waste of time , when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face as a pin cushion . James garner is in this thing , as are C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones , and James Cromwell.all are wasted here , and i 'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers . Jennilee Harrison(from the later years of Three 's Company)is also in the movie , and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role.but other than that , she ca n't rise above the mediocre script.for me , Tank is a 3/10
0 Watching " Kroko " I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life . I would not recommend to watch this movie : flat main characters - absolutely no development e.g. Kroko the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot - wise chances to do so . Uninspired actors , non - evolving plot . I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed : camera appeared shaky rather than motivated . Pictures were low - contrast , gray and dark - i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu . The story had certain potential though , it could have made a good short story .
0 Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the Edinburgh film festival . It was well shot from the outset , but that 's the last positive comment I have about the film . The acting was awful , I wonder if actual gogo girls were hired ? But it was the plot that was truly laughable , in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10.<br /><br / > * * Spoilers below * * .<br /><br />I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing:.<br /><br />Shoving the girl in the field : who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly . A real eye - opener.<br /><br />The getting on the bus scene : the girl is getting on the bus . But , according to the music , the world is ending.<br /><br />The rolling under the clothes line : Wow , this one really demonstrates the plot writer 's skills . In the room , followed by raw meat and skill selling . Why not just get her to perform all three ' sins ' at once ? At least then the film might have been slightly shorter.<br /><br />The running down the stairs of the mall : watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating Dau , no wait .. she * is * just walking quickly trying not to break her nails.<br /><br />The running covered in blood : this is definitely my favourite scene , and a fitting end to the movie . A half marathon in red paint , completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge , only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car . Not only this , but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film , now that 's sticking to character for you.<br /><br />I'd like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates . Sadly , having met the director at the presentation , this is not the case.<br /><br />But , if you 're in a sarcastic mood , and fancy a laugh with a few mates .. then still do n't even think about it .
0 I have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that periodically appear on this film 's IMDb space . I saw this movie courtesy of subway cinema 's new york Asian film festival ( which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year , see vital , snake of june , CHA NO AJI , Survive Style)and have regretted every day that a scene from that movie disengorges itself from the back of my mind , and becomes a vivid memory.<br /><br />I'm sure that you can read a laudatory summary of the film off of Subway Cinema , which is probably why I made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film . The description built up the kind of horror film that I had longed for for a while , one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares . P was in fact different . It relied on cheap laughs.<br /><br />The incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as " Lesbians team up to fight monsters . " Completely untrue . There is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere . More lies . This film seems like a short made for " Are you afraid of the dark ? " The story is ridiculous , and only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally rescinded their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the $ 9 that they wasted at the door . I almost wish paul spurrier was in the audience so that I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad softcore horror - cum - porn that belongs on the spice channel , which only succeeded to get the actress excommunicated from her family , and caused a minor stir at the belgium film festival . The only stir that this caused was a gurgle in the lower intestine as it could n't extract itself from the sh*te that it is . Anyway , I hope I can dissaude anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film , it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences , knocking out soulplane for the number 2 .
0 I will be short ... This film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer . The very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are " treated " to a lingering dance scene . The plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of BAD horror will get anything out of it . And for the love of God please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not ( childish fumbling lesbians , what the hell ? ) . this was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival ( that i saw anyway ) , someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they could n't take any more of it . this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely can not find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy . In short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class A drugs .
0 This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival , though for reasons best left to the powers that be . A lot seems to have been made of the fact that it 's the first Thai language film , made with Thai actors & crew , but directed by a westerner . Need n't have bothered to be honest , as this film is dull , dull , dull . Why hint at something , why shroud an idea in mystery , why subtly invoke a feeling , when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs , obvious shots and over the top scenes > Nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director Spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés . No hinting , no guessing , it 's all up on screen , no need to use our imaginations . Wonder when the ' scary ' bit is coming ? No you wo nt , 'cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating , rising to a crescendo of ominously . Hell , I 'm making up words to describe how bad this is . Wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary ? Why tax yourself - it 's really is a snake , and yes it 's really is biting his crotch , and there 's blood splattering everywhere . it 's a strange , uneasy film for several reasons . It 's supposed to be a horror film , but it 's not scary - the jolts are signposted & obvious . It might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of Thailand , yet the director has a sleazy , lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens . Maybe it was casting himself as the virginity - taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head . Or maybe the whole thing was just pants . Uninspired , insipid , repetitive , hackneyed - all candidates for best description , but dull seems most appropriate and honest . It 's all been seen before , probably better , often with more thought , rarely with less imagination or flare . Sorry . Thumbs down on every count . Truly dire .
0 ' P ' ( or Club - P ) should really be called ' L ' for lame . Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much - hyped logline : " Thai lesbians fighting monsters . " Rather , this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who 's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd ( but specific ) rules : " do n't walk under a clothesline , " " do n't eat raw meat , " and " do n't accept money for your powers . " Well , guess what folks , the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a ' bar - girl ' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the ' foreign johns ' who pay for her services.<br /><br />While this film ca n't even be released in Thailand due to it 's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho - hum horror pic a cross between " Showgirls " and " Interview with the Vampire " as directed by Walt Disney.<br /><br />If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre - teens only . There is literally broadcast TV adult fare , although you 'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life.<br /><br />As for the ' lesbian ' angle , there 's one brief smooch and a couple of " I love you 's " to prove that the two main stars really are a couple ( on brother ) . And the P - bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts ( there 's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl 's mouth ... ooh , phallic imagery).<br /><br />NO nudity , NO real monster ( unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes ) , and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD . You 've been warned !
0 Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology . Actually , a lot of people do . And I 'll start . I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk , because of the near unanimous bad reviews . Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it . I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and , wow .... <br /><br />SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE 'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK < br /><br />Was it boring ! I almost did n't make it through Ang Lee 's Hulk . Eric Bana was expressionless , Nick Nolte was horrible , Sam Elliott was unlikeable ( and that 's no fun , he 's usually a cool character ) . In fact , I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non - descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non - angry state . When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.<br /><br />But then something happened . About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie , there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base , fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert , then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere , only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco . This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie . And I have to say , the CGI was quite good . That 's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing . But it did n't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non - superhero action movies . And that 's quite a feat.<br /><br />Of course , the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner 's father turning into some sort of shape - shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man 's brief heroics to shame . And overall , apart from the animated mutant dogs , it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment . It was certainly better than I expected.<br /><br />OK , but what about The Incredible Hulk ? Guess what ... It 's boring too ! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here 's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible . Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee 's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also . The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous . It had skin tone and muscle tone that did n't even look like a living creature , just some sort of computer - generated texture . It was really preposterous . The lighting , environment and facial effects did n't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee 's , they looked 10 years older . And there really is no excuse for that . We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director , actor or cinematographer ever could.<br /><br />Worse , the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee 's " failure " . All the same mistakes are made . Bruce Banner is practically emotionless . The general is so relentlessly , implausibly one - dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk . The love interest is unconvincing ( I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly , though both are quite easy on the eyes ) . Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte , even though he 's only in the movie for a few minutes . The Hulk really does n't do much in this movie , certainly not any more than in Ang Lee 's version . The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast - paced , but since nothing really happened anyway that 's not worth much . Oh yeah , the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk . He 's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster . < br /><br />This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee 's version was better : if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee 's version again , I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences , or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more ( more likely I 'd just fast forward to the good parts ) . But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once , let alone twice . It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies . The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee 's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic ( except for the giant poodle , of course).<br /><br />It is absolutely mind - boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee 's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie . < br /><br />It is to Edward Norton 's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film .
0 This reboot is like a processed McDonald 's meal compared to Ang Lee 's very good but very underrated 2003 " The Incredible Hulk".<br /><br />Ang Lee 's " The Hulk " is a comic book movie for the thinking person . The Hulk takes some time to appear ( about 40 minutes ) , but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist 's core . He does his best to avoid losing control , but as he admits , when he does give in to his rage , he likes it.<br /><br />Now compare this to Edward Norton 's turn , where there is no display of conflict in his personality , and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute ( not 183 , not 197 , but exactly 200 ) . To this reviewer , this felt akin to the introduction of midi - chlorians in The Phantom Menace , which tell how strong the " force " is with one , as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test . In the 2008 movie , all Ed Norton 's Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 , as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist . And for the record , it is extremely difficult to get one 's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run , especially for a physically fit person.<br /><br />Emotions drive Eric Bana 's Hulk . He has repressed memories of his mother 's death and his father 's role in his early life . On the surface he is calm , but there underneath there is significant anger , enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed . But the Hulk never kills intentionally , even his attackers . Mostly , he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross ( Jennifer Connelly ) . He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene , saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.<br /><br />In the 2003 movie , the visual effects are there , but as necessary . The action scenes ( and there are plenty of them ) are necessary to the plot , unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.<br /><br />In his quest to turn it into a " fugitive " story , Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk . To him , the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry . And Louis Leterrier , the director picking up on Ed Norton 's cue , fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner - Hulk relationship . The story can be summed up as : Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt , Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt . Repeat as necessary.<br /><br />The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version . However , even as I am a fan of the comics , I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy 's dream but has heart over the comics - loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.<br /><br />Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics . Iron Man , also released in 2008 , is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic - book roots and has heart .
0 I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth . I was not pleased with this film . I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it . First I was very disappointed with John Hurt 's performance here . He looks as if his eyebrows were re - shaped for this . His performance was not convincing . He was not as good as one would expect . Tim Roth is cool as always here . The Gama thing did n't really stick to the original story line I do n't think . I guess the best part of the film was the end . It had some cool action . The only problem with the original was that it was too long . This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times . I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why ? . Now I know . I was hoping to to get blown away , but I was not .
0 It 's difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong , because I think the problem begins with the books themselves . Alexander McCall Smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories , but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist . He 's done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not as successfully , but based in as much fact.<br /><br />Once I realised this , it ceased to gall me that Jill Scott , an American singer / actress , is cast as Mma Ramotswe . If she is to represent a land that is not Africa , how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not African ? She 's not the only American on the cast ; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose . Both women are far , far too young for the roles they 're playing , and far too glamorous . Both brutally murder the local accents , and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting . Scott 's Mma Ramotswe is bouncy , cute and soft . Rose 's Mma Makutsi is an annoying motor - mouthed bitch.<br /><br />The result is almost unwatchable . The principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati , who turns in a decent performance as Mr JLB Matekoni . He s comes off smarter and more intense than in the books , but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for this - he 's a shining light in an ocean of suckage . The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script.<br /><br />To me , McCall Smith 's writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad . He refuses to be edited . As a result , his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific , and characters that change name mid - sentence . It is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse.<br /><br />The dialogue is now largely Anglicised . Characters speak of " opening up " and " sensitivity to needs " . Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly . Mma Makutsi moans about not having a computer , but given her constantly restyled hair , makeup and jewellery , I 'm surprised she does n't have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card.<br /><br />So what are we left with here ? It 's difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly , most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway . McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated with cute , non - threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom - nuggets . It reads well despite linguistic travesty , but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were . It just is n't true.<br /><br />Given that , it 's hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does . It remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice , however .
0 You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card . A sappy , trite verse and that will be $ 3.99 , thank you very much . You get the same with a Hallmark movie . Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact , he is not dead like we thought . Poor Ernie , he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks . In this flick , Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid . We have seen it before . You might enjoy this movie but please do n't say that you were not warned .
0 I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films . I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo , Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non - existent industry . Maybe it was because the soundtrack(which I listened to before I saw the film ) sounded different from others , maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors ) and supposedly dealed within it 's script with modern social behaviour , maybe because it 's photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical . The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser , and a major letdown . What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned " battle of the sexes " as in " all men are the same " and " why is it that all women ... ; " blah , blah , blah . Nothing new in it , not even that , it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female / male condition . Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès I talked about before(those always work , always ) and screaming performances(it is a well acted film in it 's context) .. and by screaming I mean , literally . The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones . I completely disagree with Serrano , they should n't have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through ... he made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood . Anyway , it is after all , a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it ( if you accept to be manipulated by it ) .
0 Yes . I 'll admit it . I believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work , about the trials and tribulations of 6 people , living in Mexico City concerning their sexual lives . And so , I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican movie ( in ages ) that was both popular and interesting to watch . Unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing . The story presents us with two couples , both with very obvious marital problems . When a third party comes into the life of each couple , their problems reach a pivotal point . Or absolute absurd . The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes . The stance taken by each group ( yes , they literally group , girls with girls and boys with boys ) is blatantly stupid and childish ( I guess the humor was supposed to be there ) . And it all goes from bad to worse . The performances range from good ( Miss Zavaleta ) to mediocre ( Mr Bichir ) , with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima . However , the flat circumstances that make up the plot , the one - dimensional characters , the very poor ( if not stupid ) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc , make the movie fail . Miserably . SPyL has had an ( impressive ) good reception at the box - office . Believe the hype at your own risk .
0 As a South African , it 's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense!<br /><br />Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original Shaka Zulu mini , this " addition " to the series is appalling ! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist , leader and warrior . A man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa.<br /><br />The plot of this film , however , is nothing but hogwash , scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid - nineties.<br /><br />While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors , what is David Hasselhoff doing here , rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile?<br /><br />I kept expecting blond , busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits , for no apparent reason . Not that this would 've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party , where someone 's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next " blockbuster " .
0 Complete drivel . An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical , toxic culture of a decade ago . In this movie , pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts ( the annoying redhead feeding Shaka rice ? ) . Forget historical reality too . Did n't most western slaves comes from West Africa ? An American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men ? . Finally , David Hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious . One can only ponder , how would he have fared in the miniseries ? ( Promptly impaled most likely ) . The miniseries was superb , and it is unfortunate that DH should have gotten his hands on something unique , and made it mundane . ( I tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco ) .
0 Amen to Magsel . There was a lot of confusion going on . First off , how do you know which movie you are purchasing ? Henry Cele stars in every one of them . I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries ... WHAT A LETDOWN ! ! It would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped . David Hasselhoff ( spelling ? ) is OK for popcorn TV but he was not believable in this film ( where was his English accent ? ) AND WHAT 'S WITH THE LOVE STORY ? ? ? The movie was supposed to be about a young man 's rise to military power - not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the English maiden looking for her daddy ... <br /><br />If I had paid more than $ 7 for this movie , I would have to call the police - because that would be a crime !
0 For those looking for a sequel for the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s , this is n't it . Nor is it a historical drama . Rather , it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical Shaka , but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to Sinclair 's idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus , Lincoln , Superman , and Nelson Mandela.<br /><br />On the other hand , there are a few laugh - out - loud moments , as when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt . You know , like Jesus would have done if he had n't been such a wimp.<br /><br />True , I saw only the 98-minute version , but I ca n't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better.<br /><br />And what kind of a name is Mungo ? !
0 I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed . Its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way.<br /><br />Gael is absolutely terrible , I mean he just can not act , period . He should give up now , as acting is clearly not his thing .. His co - stars are about the same caliber , i 'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them ! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous .. Somehow I do n't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy.<br /><br />I have never written a comment on IMDb , but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so.<br /><br />If you get the chance to see this film , do n't 0/10 if there was a 0
0 Hey Arnold ! is a slow - paced and slightly boring movie . The plot is not very creative . The Paul Sorvino character ( Shenk ) is buying all of the decrepit , low - priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall , shopping complex and office buildings . This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies . It is boring . Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either , so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary . Gramps remembers something about a historical document , and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga , whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk 's Mall . The kids must move around town on buses , and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly , but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids . Hey Arnold , the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining , and it has enough humor to appeal to adults . The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie . Hey Arnold the movie , is about five times more sedated , and a good way to put anyone , including kiddies to sleep . Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending . If you want to send your kids to a totally non - offensive movie , this is it . I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie , the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes . This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon . Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel .
0 Only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film . The rest of us should take a book , MP3 player , or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event . This can be best summed up as a " blown - up " TV movie being distributed into theaters . Children will want to see this film , and they will like and be amused by the movie .
0 this is a great movie . I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie . One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold ! ! ! that was great . i loved it it was pretty funny too . It 's a great movie ! Doy ! ! !
0 I have to admit that I 'm a great fan of this show , so you must know how disappointed I got when I watched this movie . First of all , the plot was awful , I thought it was going to be something more interesting , like to see what happened to Arnold fathers , or something more interesting , but NOOOOOOO , a maniac wants to destroy Arnold 's house , between many other places , so many people tries to stop this.<br /><br />I must admit that the plot was n't so bad after all , but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac , they become friends of a spy , ; they drive a bus ( based on a video game , for God sake ) , and to worse everything , they make super - moves on the bus , things that many persons had already tried and died , but not Arnold , Gerald and Helga , 'cause they are experts on a video game.<br /><br />Honestly , my mom , my sister , even me got really disappointed after watching this movie , 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon . I must admit that I used to enjoy " Hey Arnold ! " , it was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon , but after this crap of movie , I 'm not quite sure if I 'm going to watch " Hey Arnold ! " as I used to watch it on the past.<br /><br />Other thing Nickelodeon , with that enormous number of dynamite I can assure you that not a simple street would explode , I think that the whole city could explode with that , oh , and please , if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that , do n't do more movies , you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good.<br /><br />Honestly , I think this was the worst way to end this show , a good show transformed into this crap of movie .
0 tries to be funny and fails miserably . The animation is just terrible , looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep . Plot is dull and cliched . IF you have a young child , maybe rent it . but do n't waste hard earned money to pay to see it.<br /><br />1/10
0 I like animated shows . I enjoy the Nick fare pretty much , including Hey , Arnold . But moving a TV show to the Big Screen is n't easy and this just did n't feel big enough . It was more like a long episode of the show , and it just did n't move along that well . Judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us , it did n't score that well with them either .
0 When HEY ARNOLD ! first came on the air in 1996 , I watched it . It was one of my favorite shows . Then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it . I was sort of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD ! THE MOVIE since it does n't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS . Nevertheless , having nothing better to do , I went to see the movie anyway . Going into the theater , I was n't expecting much . I was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens ' cartoon like the RECESS movie was . I guess I got what I expected . It was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more . There were some good parts here and there , but for the most part , the movie was a stinker . Simply for kids .
0 the guy who wrote , directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change . Yes Rob Stefaniuk , i mean you ! Seriously , who funded this crap ? there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on . I think the idea is great but the acting , script and directing is just plain awful ! The jokes are so not funny , I understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey . BUT do it with style , this movie is screaming 1995 Saturday night live skits . Why , I say again why do studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER GIVE A COMEDIAN THE Opportunity TO WRITE DIRECT AND STAR IN HIS OWN MOVIE . DUH !
0 Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.<br /><br />At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I did n't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.<br /><br />Its a low budget film ( that s never a problem in itself ) , there were some pretty interesting characters , but eventually I just lost interest.<br /><br />I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking.<br /><br />For something similar but better try " Brother from another planet "
0 This movie has got to be one of the worst I have ever seen make it to DVD ! ! ! The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I highly caution parents on .... But the story line is like a loose cannon . If there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker - this one would have sprung from that . It reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960 's , poor script writing and filming . < br /><br />The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver . The rest of the film , could have easily been made by middle school children . I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated . My advice - Don't Watch It ! ! !
0 Although it got some favorable press after playing at the Toronto Intl . Film Festival , there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this . One -- it 's an ultra - low budget Canadian film . Two -- it 's written , directed and starring the same person ( usually a bad sign , unless it 's Woody Allen , George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers ) . But despite my watching it with lowered expectations , it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than I thought possible.<br /><br />In a nutshell -- bad script , bad acting , terrible directing ! Do n't waste your time or money on this turkey . It claims to be a comedy , but I only laughed twice . Plus , there is awful music blaring throughout . How this got any attention I 'll never know .
0 Well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype ; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to gushing reviews on CBC Radio . A refreshing , wacky , hilarious indie movie apparently . I 'd been looking forward to it for months.<br /><br />How can I put it this simply ? It sucked in a very big way . An exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius.<br /><br />At best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing . An amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />And what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track ? That was about the only truly odd thing about it.<br /><br />If you want to see a genuinely funny , bizarre movie involving aliens then try Repoman . There is no comparison !
0 The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion , the historical innacuracies are not . I do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary , but some important aspects are missing , especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it.<br /><br />Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation , which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph , in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons , one of which was Samir Kuntar , a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for " klinghoffer samir kuntar " on google . Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations , even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro . Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC , did he?<br /><br / > * * * possible spoilers * * * < br /><br />The movie almost excuses the terrorists ' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived , always accentuating and exaggerating how much the Israeli 's have done to hurt them . However , they never portray the hurt that the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis . The movie uses ( quite horrid ! ! ! ) images from the Sabra and Chatila horror , and nothing is said , understating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible , without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian - les Lebanese army who conducted the massacre.<br /><br />The acting was generally very bad , but I guess that 's what can be expected from opera singers?<br /><br />On another note I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists , and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism . Imagine how unsympathetic his wife was , spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea . I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is(wink wink )
0 After finally viewing this movie in its entirety , I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike . Is it the worst Western ever ? No , I would n't say that . But " the last great American Western " , a phrase I saw applied to it more than once ? Not even close.<br /><br />A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue , and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I 've ever seen . The movie can be measured in groaners per minute ; as in , how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life ? There 's so many instances of this that it 's distracting . Cheesy lines come at you in waves ; predictable , unoriginal , and often . < br /><br />If bad dialogue does n't bother you , then how about bad gunfights ? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that 's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously . It 's okay if there 's a comic edge to such gunfighting , such as in Silverado , but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns . The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score , but by then , I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br /><br />Other than those flaws , I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . The acting is passable , especially considering what the actors were given to work with . However , if you 're looking for the last great American Western , do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.<br /><br />3 out of 10
0 I really ca n't say anything bad * or * good about this thing . Its characters are likable enough , it 's capably produced and designed , and professional - looking ( except for that cheesy monster suit ) . However , it has no originality , no ideas , and nothing you have n't seen in ALIEN , PREDATOR , ARMAGEDDON and/or OUTLAND . It 's just another formula , cookie - cutter , " grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster " flick . Pretty much a waste of time .
0 This crew - versus - monsta has been done a hundred times , sometimes better . This one was pretty slow - moving ; only the monster 's resurrection was really worthwhile . Attempts at character developments gets botched by routine . Yeah , " routine " is the word . Went straight to video in France . No wonder
0 his costume drama is ill cast and without charm.<br /><br />George Sanders was a superb character actor . But he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead , an Eighteenth Century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks . His costar is , of all people , Akim Tamiroff . Some Frenchman ! Then there 's Signe Hasso , in a dark wig , as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family . Carole Landis fares best . The movie opens with her in silhouette . She is a soubrette , and a naughty girl at that . She disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation . But she 's good . She was always an appealing actress . Here she is cast closest to her usual type of role.<br /><br />It 's meant to be a little naughty , kind of ooh - la - la . It ought to have had a light touch but it 's a leaden affair from start to finish .
0 Positively awful George Sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar.<br /><br />While Sanders was an excellent character actor , he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it.<br /><br />It is absolutely beyond stupidity . Gene Lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting.<br /><br />Sadly , George Sanders and co - star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life . After making a film as deplorable as this , it is not shocking.<br /><br />The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here .
0 The often - reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a " delightful romance " and that Sanders is " superb . " Maltin must have confused this movie with something else . Sanders is snide and droll and superb , as usual ,  you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery , " Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three , " but dull , wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately . The storyline itself , an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief , Francois Eugene Vidocq , who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels , is entertaining enough , but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as * Marie Antoinette * , and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * ( which screams for a classy remake ) . Though , in his defense , Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character , it is all for naught . I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan , but this is 1946 , and it is one of Sirk 's earliest American efforts , lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid , breast - heaving potboilers . Sirk is just getting his feet wet here , and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with * Magnificent Obsession * , and hit his stride , bombarding us with such estrogen - fests as * All That Heaven Allows * , * Written on the Wind * , and * Imitation of Life*. But * Scandal In Paris * is hardly his best work  a relatively low - budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming .
0 " Iowa " wants to be " Requiem for a Dream " for Midwest meth , but it comes across as a hard R rated " Reefer Madness " . < br /><br />Yes , drugs are bad , and meth is horribly pernicious , as an addiction and how it destroys people , families and communities . But these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye - rolling plot wo n't teach that lesson to anyone . < br /><br />While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on screen , his partner Diane Foster plays a wincibly silly wide - eyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by Susan Sarandon in " The Rocky Horror Picture Show " . I really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through . It was n't until the end of the film that I realized I was supposed to think these two were recent high - school graduates to explain some of their naiveté , as we are bombarded by their school photos , but if so , they even looked older than the folks on " The O.C. " . While they have good chemistry on screen , they are a pale imitation of a " Badlands "- type couple . < br /><br />The guest stars are badly used . Michael T. Weiss , who was so good in TV 's " The Pretender " , is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy , as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film . Rosanna Arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano . John Savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about I did pot but this is worse . A Goth chick shows up , with the odd explanation that she 's a stripper from Des Moines . The obligatory Latino drug dealer appears - in Iowa ? < br /><br />With a limited budget , the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly , with quite scary hallucinations . We certainly see them go crazy . < br /><br />While the Iowa locations are used very well ( including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery ) , the accents and church references are confusingly Southern Baptist . Guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner - city drug - dealing movie.<br /><br />The songs of Iowa 's best known bard Greg Brown are used throughout , but oddly are not listed in the credits . I hope they were used with permission.<br /><br />I caught this at its commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it got considerable-- and inexplicable-- buzz .
0 Well , I do n't think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be . . . but there 's no denying that it 's got problems.<br /><br />Mostly , the problems are in the script . There 's a plot - but not much story , and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible ; it trots out any number of self - consciously strange and/or stereotypical characters , lines , moments , what - have - you and , by the end , it just has n't added up to much in this department.<br /><br />Sorry , but I could n't care less about whatever " social ill " Farnsworth might be trying to address ; there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains , even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia , or whatever it is those morons do . So , as a film , you wo n't find me calling " Iowa " " important . " But , at a stylistic level , the picture is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth 's choices in depicting a meth - head 's wigged - out state are beautiful , hilarious , disturbing and - yes , I 'm going to say it - inspired.<br /><br />The acting is uneven , but that just may be a casualty of the afore - praised stylistic reaching . Look , Rosanna Arquette is a fine actress - but she 's not very good here , so a discriminating audience member does have to ask , " What happened ? " It 's weird that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near . For example , I might seriously consider whatever explanation Farnsworth could provide for Michael T. Weiss 's over - the - top turn as a probation officer , but I doubt I 'd ever buy it ; It Just Does n't Work . < br /><br />Then again , it 's the most alive and in the moment that I 've seen John Savage appear in years . So go figure.<br /><br />This is the sort of work that tantalizes , but does not promise - and that 's okay ; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies . So , whether or not Farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen , but if he does , it seems pretty likely that it wo n't be bland pap . In an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of " American Idol , " perhaps we could allow , not scorn , Farnsworth 's legitimate and undeniably flawed film . < br /><br />What is more , perhaps we could welcome , not berate , his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination .
0 The week before I saw Iowa , I saw Art School Confidential , in which a pretentious student makes a film and ca n't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation . Iowa could be the film that he made . I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers . However , in addition to artiness , both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines . Iowa . This movie stumbles to a preposterous end . I have to admit that it had consistency . This movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part . The actors all did what they could . Roseanna Arquette deserves better . She demonstrates that she is very talented , very funny , and very sexy . But why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball .
0 This movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent . I 've lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people do n't have a southern accent here . This movie is about a guy who does meth and I do n't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about . It has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it 's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar . I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug . The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line . I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape do n't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day . The movie is just wrong in all directions . I would suggest " The Basketball Diaries " if I was going to suggest a movie about drugs .
0 Tasteless . I ca n't even write intelligently about the movie . I laughed the entire movie . It was n't supposed to be funny . Matt Farnsworth has no clue what he is doing . His story is written , it seems , without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the meth problem . I know Farnsworth is from Iowa , which makes his movie even more puzzling to me . Why do the two main characters have accents ? It does n't make any sense . The acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch . Gratituous violence and sex filled the movie . I am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy , but it came across as unbelievable and offensive . The ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief . As I walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me . The ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears , but it did the exact opposite . Do not waste your time on this horrible movie , unless you want to see ignorant , sappy , overacted , clichéd drivel .
0 I 'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie .. I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny . I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience , but honestly the plot to this movie needed MAJOR revision .. it did n't even make sense , one second the characters question what exactly it is that they 're snorting .. the next scene they 're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it ? ? Also the ending just took the cake .. I'm not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion .. but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... see this movie for comedy if you must ..
0 the IMDb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain ' spoilers ' . < br /><br />well , this whole film is something of a spoiler ... a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against , a tale of lost youth that does n't know where it itself is going.<br /><br />i just saw this at the tribeca film festival . this film was n't just bad , it was really bad.<br /><br />the acting is inconsistent , the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth , and farnsworth 's acting was very bad in particular.<br /><br />from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place ' graphic ' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios ... it sucked the big one . < br /><br />i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy , updated ' drugstore cowboy ' with a touch of ' natural born killers ' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking ( outside of some frat - level gore ) as the ladder . < br /><br />more than anything , someone needed to really A ) edit the screenplay < br /><br />(there are some things in there to build on and clearly < br /><br />deals with a worthy subject ... if ham - handed in it 's attempt . ) B ) edit the film . if it was cut down to a core , it might be passable . < br /><br />i would go lower than 1 if i could ... like maybe zero kelvin .
0 As far as I am concerned this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made . There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version , it is all macabre , Germanic , sinister nonsense . It reminded me of Nazis falling in love ; who cares?<br /><br />This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story . In this one we have leering John Gilbert and his gross relative the Prince lusting after this silly American actress , played by Mae Murray , possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again . I like my romances light and beautiful , with slow build ups ; not harsh and sadistic like this one . And come on , those bee stung lips , get rid of them , girl!<br /><br />Go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar . Failing that , wait till TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sound version . It 's much better .
0 Investigative reporter Darren McGavin ( as Carl Kolchak ) is back ; this time , he 's after " The Night Strangler " . Once again , police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve , or want to cover - up , the supernatural angle . Producer - director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding " Night " , with understandably less success.<br /><br />Mr . Curtis assembles a fun supporting cast , included are " Dark Shadows " alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis . Jo Ann Pflug ( as Louise Harper ) heads up a sexy collection of belly - dancers . And , although I 've never seen it mentioned anywhere , that must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin 's dining companion in an early scene , feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires ! < br /><br / > * * * * The Night Strangler ( 1/16/73 ) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin , Jo Ann Pflug , Simon Oakland , Wally Cox
0 Virgin is selected to marry rich guy . Rich guy urinates . Woman on boat likes sailor . Sailor urinates . Virgin attends gross - out commune dinner . Man urinates on dinner table . Boatwoman does strip tease for little boys . Man pretending to be baby urinates . There is an underlying theme here . Makavejev is trying to say that he is pi$$ed off at the world . To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement . To justify the title , there is a scene where Laure , who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie , bathes in chocolate syrup . It is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one 's mouth unless one happens to share the director 's fetishes .
0 Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more , even from a score of 5.8 IMDb , the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal , the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a " worst case scenario " of playing " strong " feelings accompanied by some bad acting ... Do n't waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining , if you wanna cry it might suffice though , even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy ... <br /><br />I give this 2/10 it really was awful , if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it , its all the good things this movie is n't .
0 I would n't call it awful , but nothing at all shines in this movie , and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development . It starts out well , but once the main hit is done , it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling , and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic . For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic . No explanation for that . How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly , and just enough to let Snipes do his incredible escape schtick ? This is one of far too few action scenes punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into suspending belief.<br /><br />In addition , the whole premise seems to be that the United States CIA team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying " national security " to the Brits . This gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying.<br /><br />There are a lot better action movies out there . Better formulated , better executed . This one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring -- something that should never happen in a good action movie .
0 Wesley Snipes is James Dial , an assassin for hire , agent of the CIA and pure bad - ass special operative . During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.<br /><br />Enter agent Collins , his supervising officer . Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody . Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head - shots outside of courtrooms.<br /><br />The assassination is a big success apart from the fact , that the escape plan blew . So Dial 's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police , whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.<br /><br />Fortunately for Dial the safe - house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day ( Eliza Bennett ) , who loves hanging out with cold - blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement ... <br /><br />With a script like that need I say more ? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes ( be that a pro or a con ) and the movie is quite engaging . On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />James Dial ( Wesley Snipes ) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist . Then he 's approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go . His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they do n't want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out . All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief , Windsor ( Charles Dance ) is killed , the blame falls at Dial 's feet . Hunted like an animal , he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily ( Eliza Bennett ) who 's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him.<br /><br />This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere , with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time ( I do n't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere . ) With this in mind and after Snipes 's history of duff DVD efforts , this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it 's hot . But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway . It does n't rank among his worst , but it does n't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones ( The Detonator , 7 Seconds , says it all , really ) , either.<br /><br />This is , at best , mildly suspenseful , with a minimal of action , naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role . Likewise , in a main supporting role , it 's quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs.<br /><br />It says a lot that by the end the only ' contract ' that 's keeping you interested is when Snipes 's will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films . * *
0 I once used Wesley Snipes ' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new , untried film in which he appears . So now , for the first time , my Snipes - Method of film recommendation has failed . Utterly . I should first have come here to see these reviews.<br /><br />Snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in " The Contractor".<br /><br />One of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition . I feared that the shaky , blurry , pseudo - documentary , " unconsidered " directing and editing style ( first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass - directed " Bloody Sunday " ) might propagate to other films . Greengass ' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films . My fear had come to pass . In my opinion , these films are made really bad by these motion - sickness - inducing methods , which mistake blurry swipes for " action - enhancement " . But the " Bourne Franchise , " as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow , apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast , big bucks.<br /><br />Read my lips , you Hollywood types . Action needs to be clearly photographed and presented , not merely hinted at by poor , lazy cinematographic techniques.<br /><br />And " The Contractor " goes so far as to emulate " The Bourne Ultimatum " in inanely - repeated sound bites , in hopes their juvenile ( apparently - evaluated ) audiences ca n't sense them . For example , if I hear a cop radio crackling " Yankee - Romeo " one more time , I 'll just scream . The chances are good I wo n't hear it again : I certainly wo n't ever view " The Contractor " again.<br /><br />I recommend to those of you who have yet to see " The Contractor " : just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.<br /><br />2 out of 10 ; I am tempted to lower that to a 1 .
0 Do n't really know where to start with one of the worst films I have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time . From the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited London for even 1 day will agree ... was not London . To the much unexplained way how Snipe 's character managed to escape the country back to the US without a single problem . Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America , how on earth did Grandma agree to that ... he 's an assassin ! Well that 's the ending how about during the film , well unfortunately that did n't fare much better . We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars , I 'm sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation , but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior . SO19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the Met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after Snipe 's along with the CIA . There were children walking around , but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him , does this happen in London ? No it does n't , I live there . We also have the very implausible travel from central London to the airport ( let 's say Heathrow for arguments sake ) within 5 minutes of receiving a call . We also have terrible American accents , a young girl who 's posher than the Queen , but lives in Elephant & Castle . What does it say for British police when helicopters and a number of officers at Snipe 's location ca n't find Snipe 's and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs ? The train station was obviously not even on UK soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible . The plot was also extremely poor , boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before . But there were a few notable actors cast in this film , what were they thinking and please do n't let that sway you to watch this film ! This film did n't seem to know what it wanted to be , if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting , this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it . If you want an all out action film ( which this is not ) then continuity and scenery can be put to the side .
0 The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summed up by the opening scene . The CIA want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin James Dial . The terrorist is appearing at the Old Bailey court in London which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he 's going to spend the rest of his life in jail ? He 's going to be out of circulation either way . Did n't the CIA have a chance before he was arrested ? If by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him . There 's no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison < br /><br />Since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire . Dial 's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they 're driving in crashes but Dial manages to escape . So the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash ? The film of this type of plot connivance . Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying " this airport is surrounded by armed coppers " yet Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation . The whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained . This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day . Why does she help Dial even though he 's a wanted fugitive ? Your guess is as good as mine < br /><br />This is a fairly poor thriller and do n't be taken in by the " big name " cast . Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films . Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he 's someone best known for appearing in straight to DVD fare these days , and he 's basically playing a cameo role anyway . The likes of Lena Headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they'l certainly fail to put THE CONTRACTER on their resume
0 This film was horrible . The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real - world , the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school.<br /><br />I do not recommend this film to anyone who : A ) knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations . B ) knows any detail about film making or appreciation.<br /><br />I do recommend this film to the average or below - average mind , I think it would be enjoyable if I was a dumber . If you must watch this film on a full mind , I highly recommend some kind of inebriation < br /><br />It is a total waste of what little production value it has .
0 I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like The Contractor . He is just the next action star to join a growing club : the penniless action stars of the 90s ( Van Damme , Segal , Lundgren , Snipes ) . Here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in Bulgaria ( we are supposed to believe that the location is London , like only a complete moron would buy that)The story is the one of 1000 other movies : retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job- after that government wants to get rid of him- good guy gets away after killing bad guys ( was that a spoiler ? guess not ! ) The star of the movie : the little girl ( Eliza Bennett ) outperforms everybody else of the cast!!!One star is for her plus one star for eye candy Lena Headey , makes 2 stars . Only for die hard Snipes fans!Everybody else : avoid !
0 In the words of Charles Dance 's character in this film , " Bollocks ! " No plot , no character development , and utterly unbelievable.<br /><br />Full of stuff that just does n't happen in the real world ( since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters ? ) . Full of mistakes ( Bulgarian trains in London ? ) . Full of dull and artificial dialogue . And the directing / editing is awful - wobbly hand - held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness ; confusing jump - cuts ; no structure.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes ' character is totally unsympathetic - why should we care what happens to him ? Direct to video ? Direct to the dustbin !
0 It is incredible ! ! .. yes , someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film .. it is ! Do n't do so ! I 'm totally rankled ! I liked Wesley Snipes , and I founded funny that he played his name 's meaning in a movie . Anyway , I wanted to see this film ( at home only of course ) but now ( just after ) I am absolutely disappointed ! It was his worst movie ever . Inwatchable ! ! Bad actor - play ! Bad cameraman ! Bad scenario ! .. Only one good think : that wonderful girl ! Must be a manikin surely ! Eeeeh ! ! MB .. 10 lines minimum ? ! I do n't want to waste you 're time anymore to read my opinion ! I hope , i was clear and under - stable , because English is not my native method of speaking . So have grate time , and see good films , like i try too .. Peace !
0 A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon , then other parts felt like some other movie , I do n't know which , but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie . It was kind of nice to watch , but it would have been fantastic ! if the story would have been more original . The theme little girl , bad assassin from Leon , is just tweaked a little . The opening scenes are really good :-) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen , in the movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts was from Leon , Nikita and if they where from the French or American version . If you have not seen Leon , then this is a good movie . If you liked this movie , then I can recommend Leon.<br /><br />Best Regards /Rick
0 After watching this I thought to myself , there are either too few good writers & directors or lots of producers.<br /><br />At any rate , this is a terrible movie . Terrible in a way that it 's not fun , but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver . Makes you shout " this is wrong " at the movie . Immersion is zero . By now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors / weirdness - es in movies that has computers hackers etc . in them . This movie is like that in every aspect . < br /><br />The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily , brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett . I hope she becomes big , and make this .. thing at least worth something.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor . Do n't watch this . There is not even proper action in it . Total waste of time .
0 haha ! you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie . it like says something about myself i guess . the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test , or like some sort of drug , to take you to a place you have never been before . When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus ( sp ? ) he said it was meaningless and useless , but if you read it , after you were done , it would take you to a new level , like a ladder , and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding . this movie is the same i think.<br /><br />As a movie it is without a doubt , the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way . first of all , this is snipes . i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies . and i have suffered through a few weak ones . however , although you know the movie might suck , you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was . which is the fun of it . i mean this is snipes . you know it might be good , but it will be alright , right ? smile.<br /><br />so this thing on every level is pure boredom , pure unoriginality . the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious , yet so poorly done as to be comical . there is not one character in this movie that is interesting , in the least . and to make the whole thing more surreal , they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various Bourne identity type movies , only is n't quite right . in fact , although it seems close to action movie background music , it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically.<br /><br />then all the scenes in the total pitch black , where honestly since the characters are so flat , you do n't really care what s going to happen , but regardless , after it happens and someone is killed , you just say to yourself , was i supposed to see that ? what else ? how about scenes with blinding , obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace , for a period of time that is too long to bear . sure let 's throw that in . how bout this though . when you are straining and your eyes ca nt handle it any longer , do some more of these in the dark kills where you really do n't see what happened . and on top of that , lets face it you do n't care . you were past bored way from the beginning.<br /><br />so i drifted in and out a couple times , but i caught almost all of this movie . and it becomes something you can watch , without something that engages your mind on any level , therefore , it becomes something you can effectively zone out with , and begin to think about your life , where its going , where its been , what we are as people.<br /><br />and that ... that is the true magic of this film .
0 The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub ! This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of " real " UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public . I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery.<br /><br />Worse than the worse low budget " B " film of the 50 's . An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get back.<br /><br />Avoid it like the veritable plague .
0 Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I have seen in years ... I could n't watch it to the end ... It is a pure waste of time ... I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie . There really is not much to say about it . Horrible acting , incredibly bad lines , story , everything . The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie should n't be . Just to tell you one scene : the police are searching for Snipes , and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars , they are shooting around inside the building , but still they are whispering so that Snipes does n't suspect a thing .
0 The only reason I remember this movie is because it was ( and still is ) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent . I was 17 and my friend was 18 . We were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ( ok 2nd most ) . We walked out feeling so insulted , we wanted our money back , but the time could never be regained.<br /><br />The editing is what killed this movie . As the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rockets at the truck . Please , rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium ? What 's worse is the these VW 's manage to get 15 - 18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher . You would see on VW with 4 rockets fire 2 of them , cut around the truck with the last one attached , come back a second later with two rockets attached , fire another , then go in front of the truck and now it 's back to a full set of 4 rockets.<br /><br />We toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened . It looks like they just ran out of money and stopped.<br /><br />Just ridiculous .
0 An okay film , with a fine leading lady , but a terrible leading man . Stephan Jenkins , who plays the husband , is a truly bad actor . Joyce Hyser , on the other hand , is the movie 's saving grace . She 's the best actor of the bunch.<br /><br />NOTE * the first comment , by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie ( and , according to his IMDB.com account , has only written ONE review -- and guess for what movie ? ) is obviously a plant . While the movie is nicely shot , it 's by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used.<br /><br />"Art of Revenge " is a fair movie , but it 's a big tease . It offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it . Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax , but with all the " naughty bits " edited out.<br /><br />The film , as a whole , is a bit unfocused and the ending , and much of the third act , is really a big mess . There 's a twist ending , of course , since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending.<br /><br />A 4 out of 10.<br /><br / >
0 There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer : actress Nichole Hiltz . She is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge . Directed by Simon Gornick , the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin ' spouse . Oh , but not by conventional means . She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice . She wants Nichole ( as Tuesday ) to get close to her ex ( the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins , who should stick to music ) to embarrass him and ruin his life . David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments , and former " Crime Story " star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl . Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful , then evil and devious . She also handles vulnerable and " maybe a bit psychotic " well . She 's also quite hot ( though there 's no naughty bits show ) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at . But the performance is kind of wasted in this movie , which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend .
0 You 've heard it said to live every moment as if it 's your last ? Whether it 's your last day or not , I beg you not to waste any part of it watching this ! Nichole Hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy ( that alas , stays wrapped ) and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials . A shallow , unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no " Art " in the " Art of Revenge".<br /><br / >
0 blows my mind how this movie got made . i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone -- i ONLY watched it because i hoped the " revenge " part would be good . needless to say , the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched . in fact , i 'm not even sure what happened at the end any more . the acting was as bad as re - enactment scenarios on the " FBI Files " show -- by far , the worst re - enactments ( really only " Arrest and Trial " can possibly be as bad at re - enactments ) . i did n't even know that the leading man was in Third Eye Blind until i looked the movie up here on IMDb , but its obvious why he has n't made any movies since . i hope he is a good singer .
0 This 2003 made for TV movie was shown on a women 's channel , naturally . As a man , why do I even attempt to watch this ? I do n't know , but I should have my head examined . And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does . He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in . Number one bore is Joyce Hyser as the wife . I could n't wait for him to drop her . Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie . The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz , about the coldest person you 'd ever want to meet . Her looks did n't warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious , only a fool could miss . Definitely a loser . Tembi Locke was pretty good , but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband , again played as a guy who is a loser , by David DeLuise . Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero . Stephen Jenkins as our hero , or should I say victim , was not that good . At first I thought he just a bad actor , but later I believed it . He never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout . Although , as a man , I became enraged when the two women got away with it . Men , beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder . LMN is the channel . Beware . Note : Having watched this a second time by mistake , I am convinced on my initial thoughts . Especially on the writer / director , Simon Gornick . I still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped . Only saving grace in this film is Tembi Locke who does n't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of Jenkins , Hyser , Hiltz and DeLuise around her . Plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse . Down with Gornick 's movie and his vacant stars in it . Please LMN do n't show this trite again .
0 A novel by Remarque . A cast that looks great on paper . A left - wing refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the wars . A Gestapo officer undercover.<br /><br />It 's a pity there 's no synergy here . The bits and pieces never coalesce.<br /><br />Stories about left - wing refugees in France do n't have to be this dull . Read Arthur Koestler 's memoir " Scum of the Earth " ( if you can find it ) . Or his chilling " Dialogue With Death " ( ditto).<br /><br />To me , the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details.<br /><br />The leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados , the Norman apple brandy . I welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself . It certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly . But , according to the film , it 's only sold in cheap , low - class saloons . Vive le tabac parisien ! That 's what I say . References to intoxicating liquors do abound here ; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists.<br /><br />I enjoy films set in France because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full - size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background . I was n't disappointed . This time it was for Byrrh , a very unusual choice . This film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals.<br /><br />The film 's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg . Gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera " The Emperor Jones " , based on the O'Neill play . It premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson . The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett . It should surface again soon though ; they 're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.<br /><br />Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer 's character operates under his " Czech " aliases . Two of them are " Wozzeck " and " Gunther " , both prominent roles in German opera . Is that just coincidence?<br /><br />Name - dropping just seems to be part of this film . Notice that they call up " Himmelstoss " on the phone . Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in Remarque 's earlier " All Quiet on the Western Front".<br /><br />Well , the in - jokes are all in place ; guess there was n't time to develop any drama .
0 This stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman that I 've seen . Even her luminous screen presence ca n't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that 's nearly impossible to sit through without fast - forwarding a lot of it.<br /><br />Only for die - hard Bergman fans ; others are very likely to fall asleep . I suggest you to watch " For Whom the Bell Tolls " instead .
0 One of those , " Why was this made ? " movies . The romance is very hard to swallow . It is one of those romances , that , suddenly , " click " - they are in love . The movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments - the drive - in restaurant being the most notable . Charles Grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie it 's just him and Louise Lasser . Ask yourself , do you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half ?
0 You 'll notice that the chemist , who appears in two scenes and gets to speak , is played by Stephen King . " Do n't give up your day job " is the standard thing to say , but that 's not fair . King acquits himself reasonably well : he 's no worse than any other member of the cast , and better than most . The story , on the other hand , is pure rubbish . Please , give up your day job.<br /><br />Never have I seen so many dreadful performances - of which the lead actor 's ( the LEAD ACTOR 'S ! ) is probably the worst - gathered together in the one film . Everyone acts hammily , but not in any entertaining way ; they all somehow manage to go over - the - top without expending , or manifesting , energy . I blame screenwriter / director Tom Holland . It ca n't be that ALL the actors are REALLY this bad . What are the odds against that ? Admittedly , I 've never heard of any of them before , but still , I do n't think I could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if I tried : ONE actor , despite my best efforts , would turn out to have talent . So what 's more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake - eyes , or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly ? That would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script . The more direction an actor got , the worse he performed . ( " You want me to bend over like a hunchback , talk from the back of my throat , show all my teeth , and look bored , all at the same time ? Okay ... ")<br /><br />This theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland undeniably managed to co - write a lousy script . Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a likeable character , but that 's a misleading way of putting it . He 's not a knowable character . All we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he 's fat , and that all he can think about is food . ( " All I can think about is food , " he tells us , helpfully . ) And in the end ... <br /><br />(Sigh ) I suppose I ought insert a spoiler warning here ... <br /><br />In the end he becomes evil . Why ? I can only shrug . Perhaps he 's under some kind of enchantment . Yeah , that 's probably it . By " evil " perhaps I mean " inexplicable " - it 's not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means - end psychology . Anyway , his actions at the end make no sense , nobody 's actions make much sense , and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience.<br /><br />By the way , here 's my nominee for hammiest line / delivery : " I do n't think you 'd like it . IN FACT ... " [ big dramatic pause ] " ... I do n't think you 'd like it at all . "
0 No , I have n't read the Stephen King novel " Thinner , " but I choked down the film version . Horror movies are an acquired taste . Regular movies give an audience a hero to applaud as he strives to achieve a goal . In horror movies , audiences are invited to savor the demise of characters . In director Tom Holland 's low - fat but tasteless revenge chiller " Thinner , " nobody wins and everybody deserves the bite that is put on them . Gluttonous New England attorney Billy Halleck ( Robert John Burke of " Robocop 3 " ) has a weight problem . Although he rocks the bathroom scales at 300 pounds , he appears happily married to a trim , delectable wife , Heidi ( Lucinda Jenney of " G.I. Jane " ) with a yeasty teenage daughter.<br /><br />Fat does n't mean stupid here . Halleck displays his sagacity in court when he wins an acquittal verdict for sleazy Mafia chieftain Richie Ginelli ( Joe Mantegna of " House of Games " ) . Driving home from a victory feast , Billy hits an old gypsy woman crossing the street and kills her . A cover - up occurs , and Halleck 's friends get him out of the soup . The disgruntled gypsy father Taduz Lemke ( Michael Constantine of " Skidoo " ) retaliates with a curse on the corpulent lawyer and the two town officials that exonerated him . Suddenly , Halleck finds himself shedding pounds no matter how much chow he chomps . When he begs the vengeful Gypsy to lift the curse , the old man refuses . Desperately , Halleck resorts to Richie . While Halleck struggles with the gypsies to remove the hex , he learns that his loyal wife has turned his attentions to the town 's hotshot doctor.<br /><br />"Thinner " qualifies as not only laughably inept horror flick , but the filmmakers also rely on stereotypes of men and women . Tom Holland , who directed " Child 's Play " ( 1988 ) , and scenarist Michael McDowell , have served up such a slipshod script that you can not relish watching Billy get his just dessert and shrivel up . " Thinner " boasts few shocks and fewer surprises . The filmmakers may have regurgitated King 's novel , but they have filleted whatever sense of horror and humor it contained . Holland and McDowell introduce characters , such as the Mafioso , then inexplicably let them off the hook . One minor character shows up long enough to die and have a chicken 's head stuffed in his mouth.<br /><br />The stereotypical behavior of the characters may offend audiences , too . " Thinner " depicts women as oversexed vixens and men as swine . When Halleck sneaks home from a clinic , he finds his doctor 's sports car parked at his house . His suspicions ripen into jealousy and he cooks up a scheme to get the curse transferred to this wife . Even the premature ending lacks any satirical flavor . Oscar - winning special effects wizard Greg Cannom of " Van Helsing " and make - up artist Bob Laden do a fabulous job beefing up actor Robert John Burke to look obese . They succeed , too , in making him shrivel.<br /><br />Only die - hard Stephen King fans will be able to stomach this misogynistic gooledyspook .
0 Just another example of why Stepehn King 's books should not be made into movies . ( Even Carrie , one of the best , is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen . ) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer , always on a diet , who " accidentally " kills an old gypsy woman . In court , with the help of the judge and the local police chief , he gets off , even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving . The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 , with our main character , Billy ( the lawyer ) getting thinner and thinner by the day . Though the movie kept with the book , for the most part , and has your typical King ending , the acting was stilted and felt forced . We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between , sort of like reading acts in a play . King himself made a cameo in the movie ( sort of like Dave Barry ) , which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that : authors . Leave the acting to actors . Not that anyone in this movie was that great . I 've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better .
0 I was really looking forward to seeing this film , but after watching it I was really disappointed . The best bit was when Stephen King was in it . Rober John Berk can not act to save his life and neither can any of the others . A few of the performances even made me laugh out loud ! The film was was not as I imagined it , after reading the book which was awesome , I imagined it darker and a lot scarier . If i was Stephen , I would be really mad!<br /><br />I do n't know why they changed the ending , I thought the ending of the book was very good . If you just found out the pie killed your daughter , you would n't feed it to anyone else would you?!<br /><br />Book was so much better !
0 The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin . And gross . An obese lawyer drives over the Gypsy woman , and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to the bone . OK , Gypsy curses should be entertaining , but the weight - losing gone bad ? Nope . Except Stephen King thinks so . And Michael McDowell , other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film , does so , too . The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible , he is fat too , haha ! The Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he / she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness . Hey , I can only say : Well , look at the mirror .
0 This move reminded my of Tales from the Crypt Keeper . It has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve . I think that 's always the them in a Crypt story . The same goes for the bad acting . Very bad acting . I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people did n't like it and I was n't expecting much . Whenever I watch a stephen King movie I do n't expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels . I have read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books . I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such . It was so good . But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies . The endings were very different then the movie versions . I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy . I ending of Thinner is the worst . So Cheesy . I want to read the book to find out the real ending . I suggest everyone who intends to read stephen King 's novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare . And that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book . I intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies . I 'm sure if they were made into movies they were real good books ... and the screenplay went terribly wrong .
0 I am not one of those who think King is a great writer , his books are fine distractions for a few hours , and often have interesting premises , however they , in my opinion , fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought.<br /><br />This film suffers from being a pretty exact re - telling of King 's story . If you have read the book , there are zero surprises , no changes , no altering of scenes or characters . This is a film made by King fans for King fans.<br /><br />For the rest of us , there is nothing terrible about the film , it is a ' gypsy curse ' horror , with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for , to become thinner . The final third has some severe structural problems , and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little.<br /><br />There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life , but you might as well read the book , because there is nothing new here ... <br /><br / >
0 I began watching this movie with low expectations , as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel ( a novel i never read).<br /><br />I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was n't nothing close to good , but it manages to keep you interested . What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors . The movie is overlong , has n't no " nice " shots and no scares , the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap.<br /><br />The only things good are that , as i said , it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good ) without using much horror cliches.<br /><br />My Vote 4/10 .
0 To call a movie like " Thinner " bad is like calling the earth round or Pauly Shore un - talented . No news , but how they got that way is what people want to know.<br /><br />As far as this movie .... The book was good , even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the " be careful what you wish for " genre . Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father ( Constantine from TV 's " Room 222 " ) to several pounds a day . < br /><br />Like I said , it starts out good , but why involve the mobster ( Mantegna ) ? Why fire automatic weapons so much ? Why turn it into something so heavily dependent on FX ? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes , diseases , death , gypsy lore and such . < br /><br />But no , it 's not to be . Remember , this is Stephen King we 're talking about.<br /><br />And the ending ... almost the same as the book , but a little too talky . In fact the whole movie talks too much , feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us . Not that I expected " The Dead Zone " , but I could have done without another " Pet Sematary " , thanks anyway.<br /><br />One star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job . However , the rest of the movie is left to be ... say it with me ... " Thinner " .
0 So ' Thinner ' ... Yep .. This Steven Bachman ( read Steven King ) yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a Gypsy Elder who he just killed , The story itself is there , no doubt about it , but I do n't know why I did n't enjoy it more than I could have . I guess what really distracted me was the actors . I mean , who 's the lead ? Robert John Burke ? Who 's he ? And fer crying out loud , can someone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role there ever is ? And while we 're at it , does every Mafioso have to have a pasta cooking Italian mother ? The only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup , Michael Constantine as the Gypsy elder . He 's pretty good . But the rest , I make you all , " better actors ... "
0 A fun concept , but poorly executed . Except for the fairly good makeup effects , there 's really not much to it . There are obvious problems ; for example , after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size , the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days ... and once he 's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.<br /><br />In any case , the movie has far worse problems than that -- the cinematography is decidedly low - budget - TV - show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around . Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse.<br /><br />The only reason why I 'm giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegna 's character takes over , the movie develops a fun , campy ' cheesefest slaughterhouse ' feel , and the gangster 's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch . The ending , if predictable , is also nicely mean . Avoid unless you 're a King - o - Phile or are REALLY psyched up at the idea of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp .
0 This movie was absolutely terrible . I ca n't believe I paid to see it in the theatre . I would n't watch it on free cable t.v . I 'm surprised that Joe Magtena even made it . Do not waste your time with this movie .
0 It seems to me that Stephen King 's " Bachman " pen - name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer , rawer , more mean - spirited stuff that he wanted to write without ' contaminating ' his ' brand name ' . If you look back at the " Bachman Books " ( Running Man , The Long Walk , Roadwork , Thinner ) you notice they have a sealed - in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King . I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated , blood - covered , emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom ... but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit , and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling . Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly . ( BTW , " Pet Semetary " could have easily been a Bachman book if King had n't revealed the alias by then . And " The Dark Half " seems to be at least partially about his " Bachman " persona.)<br /><br />"Thinner " was the last Bachman book , and man , with its themes of class warfare , revenge , and death by starvation , it is nasty . So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit . < br /><br />What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a " TV Movie Of the Week " level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release . ( These days , something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable ) . The makeup work and the striking motif ( starving to death in the midst of plenty , a metaphor for the overfed , undernourished American middle class if there ever was one ) is all that keeps you watching this misfire . < br /><br />What went wrong ? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe , but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here ( with the exception of Joe Monetegna ) simply ca n't carry the movie . And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure . Plus he could n't leave the plot alone , and his changes do n't really help . The script and dialog ought to work , but mostly the movie just lies there . Everything is muffled , dull , airless , and no fun to watch ... with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting .... thinner , and thinner , and thinner . < br /><br />As other have pointed out , " Thinner " is by no means the worst King movie ever made ( or even the second worst ) . And it does have a dreadful , compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work . But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations .
0 It 's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie . Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments , what 's so difficult about capturing the robbers ? Just eliminate the bank workers , see who was at the bank - from all the cameras ' footage angles - prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages . Where is the suspense every body is talking about ? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door ... seen it many times . At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting . The Movie is not worth it . Pronto !
0 I have never seen any of Spike Lee 's prior films , as their trailers never caught my interest . I have seen , and admire Denzel Washington , and Jodie Foster 's work , and have several of their DVDs . I was , however , entirely disappointed with this movie . If this film is any indication of Spike Lee 's ability as a director , my advice would be to " get a job " , and stop wasting the time and talent of others . < br /><br />I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I 'd seen . I can only assume , from their sappy lovelorn reviews , that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work . I only paid $ 2.50 , in a " Second Run " theater , and still felt I 'd wasted my money.<br /><br />The IMDb " Trivia " page says it all ....... <br /><br / > * " Shot in 39 days " -- How can you expect to shoot a big budget " Blockbuster " , ( as the media hype promised ) , in such a short time ? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all.<br /><br / > * " Ron Howard was first going to direct the film ... " -- He may have done this project some justice , given more time to do so , of course . Though the writing was atrocious , the premise had some merits . < br /><br />OK ! maybe not . I 'm sorry ! This film was so rife with pitiful cliché 's , implausible scenes , and lousy characterizations , that maybe even he could n't have made much of it . ( Hey Ron ! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good call ! ) < br /><br / > * " Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks . " -- And it showed ! Her portrayal of a " Fixer " , who makes people 's problems go away , was as unbelievable as the script she was given . Did she even want to be there?<br /><br />Other Peeves : < br /><br / > * How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door , and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank , and he 'd better keep away ... or else ? < br /><br / > * When " Detective Frazier " , ( Denzel Washington ) , comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet , how many bank robbers , without a gun , would have " led " a cop , ( much less " let " a cop ) back out to the front door , allowing the police officer to walk behind him ? < br /><br / > * Det . Frazier later claimed , to have given the robber " every reason to shoot me . " Why , then , in their brief struggle , did n't he even try to expose the robber 's face ? That may have gotten the response he was looking for ... a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification . And why did it take " Steve , Stevie , Steve - O " , ( the robber 's accomplice ) , so long to come and help out ? < br /><br / > * I understand that these were n't your typical bank robbers . They had a different agenda , and did n't want anyone harmed . But the cops had no reason to think that they would n't . To them it was a desperate situation . Why then , when two of the bad guys stepped outside to " pick up the pizzas ? " , were they not taken down . ( first of all , how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield ? Is this Spike Lee 's version of NY City , or SNL 's ? ) . Taking them down would have reduced the bad guy 's numbers , screwed up their plans , and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up . If not , there at least would be fewer bad guys inside . ( Give SWAT something to do , or send them home!)<br /><br / > * What police department in this country , would have allowed Madeline White , ( Jodie Foster ) , to just waltz right into the bank , and discuss a matter with the robbers , that she would not disclose to them first ? She had no authority , no governmental credentials ; and besides , this was after all , " already " a hostage situation ... add one more?<br /><br / > * Why would n't the Bank CEO , ( Christopher Plummer ) , just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago ? Screw sentimentality ! The diamonds , he could have sold.<br /><br / > * Who was that " schmuck " , ( the character , not the actor ) , with the Jersey accent , that , conveniently , volunteered , and said he knew the recording was " 100 % Albanian " , but yet he himself could n't speak it ..... SIR ! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN ! And his Ex - wife ! What a " schlump " she was ! ! ! Both were totally unbelievable . < br /><br / > * When interrogating suspects , why did Det . Frazier , continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist ? , ( i.e. - telling the elderly woman she could go , and then she could n't , then could ; then could n't ? ) Give me a break ! < br /><br / > * Who , after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites , could n't deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages ? < br /><br / > * Near the end of the movie , a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room , behind which Clive Owens hid out for " a week" .... where did the materials come from ? ( the drywall & studs ) . It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer , so he could relieve himself . The bank employees had n't complained about the smell , all week long ? Hello!<br /><br / > * After such a debacle ; since the documents " had " fallen into the robber 's hands , what kind of " references " was Ms. White expecting to get from the bank CEO , seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail , due to her failure?<br /><br / > * And last , but certainly not least , What 's with the " Electric Glide " that Denzel did ? HOW STUPID ! Was that supposed to indicate his " resolve " to bring these guys to justice ? He looked , rather , like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart , while trying to prevent a bowel movement ! " Cheeee - Zheeee " ! ! ! ! < br /><br />Other than the mediocre plot ; lousy script ; bad acting ; and overall pitiful directing ...... yada , yada , yada . < br /><br />Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!<br /><br />.
0 My wife and I found this film to be highly unsatisfying . While the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what is going on , when you leave the theater , there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all . ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Christopher Plummer , enormously wealthy head of a NY bank has a terrible hidden secret . Profiting from WW II deals with the Nazis and hiding loot stolen from Jews , he keeps the evidence ( including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika ) in a safety deposit box in his bank . Why ? If he wants this never to be revealed , why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago ? And the diamonds ? Obviously , he does not need them - why keep them rather than dispose of them ? How did the bank robbers find out his secret ? How did they know to zero in on this very safety deposit box # 232 ? Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records show SD Boxes No 's 231 and 233 , but no # 232 . Curious . He meticulously found time somehow to do an exhausting search of bank records to unearth this one curious fact . All the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily . Wow ! Talk about super powers for a detective.<br /><br />The bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened . They take only the contents of SD Box # 232 , ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president . This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind , or for his henchmen with lesser brains.<br /><br />Jodie Foster , using her political connections with the Mayor of NYC , gains permission to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many hostages . She offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand , but he ai n't interested . So what 's his point ( if any?).<br /><br />My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players , Christopher Plummer ( Bank President ) , Denzel Washington ( ace detective ) , and Jodie Foster , crack trouble shooter for high - powered problems.<br /><br />The last Jodie Foster movie I saw , " Flight Plan " , was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all . I thought I liked Jodie Foster , but I will probably avoid her future films.<br /><br />Now my problem is that I can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies . I can not disagree with her on this one ... " A WASTE OF MONEY , AND A WASTE OF TIME . " Be forewarned . A well crafted film , fine actors , lousy script writing .
0 A yawn - inducing , snail - paced disappointment , Inside Man tells the story of a detective ( Denzel Washington ) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money . When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief ( Clive Owen ) and his team , the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender  his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position . Enter a powerful woman ( Jodie Foster ) with secrets and intents of her own , sent to recover an item from the bank owner 's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank , and you have quite the three - way dilemma . Unfortunately , all you get it set - up in the film , and nothing pays off in the end . Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance . The only saving grace for the film is its competent co - stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen , who are much better than the film itself . In fact , Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high - caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless , cutthroat villain of sorts . Clive Owen is n't given much to do besides brood and pose , but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role . It 's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest . You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film . The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man , however , is how much unwarranted praise it has received . For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre - summer blockbuster , this one falls horribly flat .
0 Movie : There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie . Its truly awful . Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it , it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick . Characters / Actors : Denzel has done " EXACTLY " what he does in every movie , so no surprise there . Here is a little mind game for the readers . Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies . Now count how many of them were in which he played a cop / detective / body guard , whatever . Clive Owen , hmmmmmm , this guy needs a better role on his plate soon . His best performance was I think in " Beyond Borders " . Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well . His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in " Sin City " . Surely this guy knows acting , what he does n't know is better way of choosing roles . He is in desperate need of a better agent . Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie , if you are watching her for the first time in your life . She has done better . She has had better roles . It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie . Plot : Plot was not confusing , in fact , I could think of such a plot , in fact the whole movie , while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner . I mean come on , * * * * SPOILER ON THE WAY---- > I am sick of the un - necessary Haulocast and the Racism token . The movie is about bank robbers , why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there , nice try playing with people 's emotions , worked on anyone ? NOT ME . Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages ? Riiiiiiight , please , we 're talking about US police force and security here . Nobody could find out where Clive was , I mean they did n't find anything different with that room . Who 're we kidding ? Conclusion : Sure , go watch this movie , if nothing , you 'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was . At least people wo n't think you 're stupid to go watch this movie because they 'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast " MISTAKE " .
0 This is a dumb movie . Maybe my judgment would n't be so harsh if the film did n't promise so much , but I just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn.<br /><br />I did n't have any beef with the acting , but I thought the characters were awful . The movie starts off with Clive Owen 's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is , and how he planned the perfect bank robbery , something he frequently reminds us of later . Oh yeah , he also tells us he 's in a prison cell , although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor . Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong , and you 're long gone before the police show up . But Clive Owen 's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours - for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell . He also has to control hostages , negotiate with cops , and most fantastically of all , perform a This - Old - House job on the bank 's stockroom and hide out there for a week ( I hope he brought enough food , and a bucket to pee in ) and then sneak out again . Yeah , that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me , Clive ! This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it did n't fall apart was the screenwriter said so.<br /><br />And then there are the many unexplained details : Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages ? Who the hell is Jodie Foster 's character , and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she does n't have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because " it 's above his pay scale ? " How dumb are these cops that they ca n't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery ? How did the robbers slip away , and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week ? How did they find out about the bank chairman 's past , and the number and contents of his safe deposit box ? Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops ? Since when do they make toy AK-47s that look real up close ? How the hell do you bug a pizza box , anyway ? How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours , undetected ? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond?<br /><br />None of these questions are ever answered . There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off - screen , but I never felt that way about Inside Man . It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie , or these questions never had any answers in the first place , and that 's weak . Particularly annoying is Jodie Foster 's character , who wo n't disclose what she does , but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is . We 're just supposed to take her word for it , I guess.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie two stars is I laughed at Denzel 's " taxi cab " and " pina colada " gags , and at the kid 's outrageous video game . Other than that , this movie has no redeeming features .
0 This movie makes no sense at all , there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous NYPD vehicles through . The characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever . I will put my comments in the chat board , but save your time and money , this is stupid . I ca n't stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music , and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level . But it is nice to see Denzel W. prevail over the Man , who comes in 3 flavors , Jodi Foster , Mayor Bloomberg and Capt . Von Trapp . There is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice .
0 Three story lines and not enough tying them together , " Inside Man " was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic . Though having its moments , the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl , jumped quickly between highs and lows , and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes . I will give credit to Denzel Washington , he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical " super - detective " with all the answers . Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as " evil genius " and " criminal mastermind " ( both not the same in retrospect ) . Overall though , each person individually created a great sub - section . Yet , when the parts finally came together and everything counted , there was no sudden " ah - ha ! " or summation of everything . It all ended up with very little of the energy it began with , with a lot of plot - holes , tons of questions , and as I said earlier , no where near Spike Lee 's normal level . I have to completely disagree with the so - called " professional critics " ... this is not the movie they play it up to be .
0 Now is n't it ? Considering all the good work done by danzel , Clive and Jodie , the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die - hard / heist movies copycat . Yes a couple of jokes , no absolutely no unpredictable twists , to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes , it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us . IF someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe , who the hell is the Rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell , it could just make my day , but it seems that Spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted , and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy ...
0 The trailers for this film were better than the movie . What waste of talent and money . Wish I would 've waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I would n't be out $ 9 . The movie totally misses the mark . What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors , turned out to be a B - movie at best . Movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought it was going somewhere , it almost did but then it did n't . In this day and age , we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film , and this film offered neither . The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good , however , not sure if it was the way it was directed , the lighting , the delivery of lines , the writing or what , but nothing came from it . Lot of hype for nothing . I was VERY disappointed in this film , and I 'm telling everyone NOT to see it . The cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well . And the ending had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film . What a disappointment .
0 This movie had so much potential - a strong cast , a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget . I 'm not sure where it all went wrong , but each of those elements was wasted . The story went nowhere , the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring , pointless , waste of a film . I hated it . Judging by the other votes , I 'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak . However , I thought this movie was dreadful . I had high hopes , but was very disappointed . A particular disappointment was Jody Foster 's character . A very cocky " fixer " of sorts makes a nice idea . Jody was confident and sexy , but the character did nothing and went nowhere . Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable but nothing new .
0 First , this film is not a " thriller . " Neither is it " gripping , taut . " It might have been so based on the script , but the direction 's slow pace makes it difficult to get into.<br /><br />The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious . Unfortunately , we only get a sense of * how * ingenious after the picture is over . That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that do n't grab the viewer , and " cunning vixen " scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence.<br /><br />I wish this had been the fast - paced thriller the box promised . It would 've been an outstanding film . Instead , Spike Lee made it plod along through the end .
0 For me an unsatisfactory , unconvincing heist movie . With an A - List cast , particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub - genre . For a start I did n't like the pacing of the film , starting off with mastermind Clive Owen 's raison d'etre piece to camera , unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion , then finding the narrative peppered with confusing , not to say unreal - seeming witness interviews , then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier . Of course the camera work is fluid throughout , constantly on the move and incorporating hand - camera shots a - plenty , but director Lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense , falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film . Denzel Washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad - ass jive talk of a " Shaft " movie thirty - five years earlier ( he even has that " no - one understands him but his woman " thing going on , replete with his " hot " girlfriend , baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate " dirty - talk " ) and his mild " In The Heat Of The Night " riff with Willem Defoe ( in almost a bit - part ) raises barely a ripple . Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we 're given to believe the gang is Arab - based , also hindered by having to play 90 % of the film with a mask over his face . Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tight - lipped , ice maiden , sub - Clarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bounty - hunter , if you will , to little effect . Overall it 's a real mish - mash of a film , with a light but obvious twist at the end , in fact the title gives it away from the start , spoiler fans . Worst scene ( of many ) is undoubtedly Washington 's witness - interview , unbelievably , with an 8 year old street - kid , although Owen 's dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes . During the film in - joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like " Serpico " and " Dog Day Afternoon " - but there 's no honour in self - praise . More like " The Hot Rock " instead ... and even that was good for a few laughs .
0 This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly is n't that great . Sure , " CHAOS " and " INSIDE MAN " are literally the same movie , just with variations in suspense . But I found " CHAOS " more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film " Swordfish . " The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and " Chaos " was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters , but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. < br /><br />It 's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films , but that does n't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch . < br /><br />Watch it if nothing else is on T.V. , but you 'll probably get bored with after awhile .
0 No movie with Madeleine Carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable . That said , I have to add that this British film comes close . The story takes place on board the ` SS Atlantic ' and it 's loosely based on the ` Titanic 's ' unfinished voyage . The word ` unsinkable ' is spoken , the liner strikes an iceberg , and we hear a heavenly choir sing ` Nearer My God to Thee . ' The doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem , in a clever bit of sound work . But the year of the film 's release ( 1929 ) means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage . These are n't problems . The film 's major flaw is pacing , and pacing had been well developed in silents . However , if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed , the movie 's running time would be cut in half . The intended effect was drama ( and clarity in a new medium ) , but the result unhappily is tiresome now . The film 's structure is preposterously illogical and inept . Paradoxically , I found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique : fine , abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another , sometimes even on sound effects . Although we 're on board the ` Atlantic ' from the first shot , we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before I discovered that fact . There are long , intrusive musical passages by the ship 's dance orchestra . ( Entertaining , easy sound . ) Personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way . Do n't even think of spectacle . The berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ship 's hull is a minor dent . However , the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats - clearly staged on a real liner , presumably tied up to a dock - generate great excitement . Other than the glorious Miss Carroll , these sequences are the film 's only points of excellence . As the movie and the ship near their end , the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail . Their last , eternal blackout is the end of the film , with a sunset / sunrise tacked on , a clumsy symbolic effect . ` Atlantic ' is a cinema curiosity . At best.<br /><br / >
0 Yes I know " talkies " had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films . It comes over as a filmed " hammy " stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines , rolling their eyes , using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema , which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen . The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film . It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film . In next chronological order they could see " Titanic " ( 1953 ) A Night to Remember ( 1958)"Titanic ( 1997 ) , to see how the cinema 's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years . There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious " SOS Titanic " ( 1979 ) On my version which is a DVD , David McCallum gives the introduction . It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi 's junior wireless operator in " A Night to Remember"(still the best feature film - please read my " Tribute to Walter " comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk)and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled " End of a Dream " so he was well qualified to give the narration . Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD.Actors speak the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer , J Bruce Ismay , Managing director of White Star , Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart ( The " old Rose " in Titanic 1997 ) whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors .
0 I am a Motion Picture Production major at Wright State University in Ohio , and yesterday I was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god - awful film in class . We were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us , but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films - a complete disaster.<br /><br />The problem with early sound films was that Hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they were n't good at memorizing lines . So producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors . Sounds like a great idea , right ? Well , the kind of acting one does on stage does n't show up too well on film . Most of the actors in " Atlantic " look and sound like they 're acting in a play , which results in lots of hearty laughs at the over - acting . Another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones . You could n't move the mikes like you can today , you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through . There was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie . In one particular scene , there is a man sitting at a table . Someone walks right up to him and delivers their line , then walks away . Another actor comes up from behind him , delivers their line , then walks away . It goes on like this for a couple more people . The microphone is obviously right by the man at the table , making for a laughable actor carousel.<br /><br />Those are only technical problems . If you get into the story and direction , then it gets even worse . The story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the Titanic . The characters are unbelievable and pointless . A " story " about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie . It is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place . A lousy attempt at high drama , the actors take long , pregnant pauses between lines many times . It is tiresome , and you ca n't wait for this 90 minute ( feels like 180 at least ) movie to get over with . I 'm not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country , but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie , and they were portrayed as animals . They both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats . They were ordered to stop or be shot , and of course they did n't so they were shot . I was appalled.<br /><br />I give this movie a 2/10 . I would have given it a 1/10 ( the lowest rating possible ) , but I gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films , and I tried to put it into context . If you want to see a good early sound film , check out Alfred Hitchcock 's " Blackmail " that also came out in the year 1929 . You will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately .
0 1st watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir - Ewald Andre Dupont ) : Fairly lame account of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much - heralded event . The replication of the disaster is not bad , but the drama around it is at some times silly , badly acted and way - too soap opera - like . The story is very much the same as the most recent Oscar - winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late . Good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what James Cameron was competing against(barely  ) in his recreation .
0 Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock 's novel for the tube , yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just does n't know when to quit . Struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy , enigmatic Ellen Burstyn , who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom . After learning about the last gathering held there -- Ellen 's daughter 's coming - out party -- Tilly decides on her artistic theme , never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began , nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another ! Two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which does n't bear close scrutiny , one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity . Burstyn 's role teeters on camp , while Tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy - eyed - waif routine . Only one sequence late in the film ( the morning after the mural is finished ) is charged with honest feeling , anger and betrayal . The rest is piffle .
0 Need I say -- its a stinker ! ( I gave it a rating of 2)<br /><br />Only watch it if you suffer from insomnia.<br /><br />There 's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up , but not much else happens in this movie . There is no suspense , no deep , shocking secrets revealed , no real threat to the heroine 's well being . A few disagreements , slight raising of voices -- that 's pretty much it . The secrets are nothing that could n't happen to anybody - the last " secret " revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point.<br /><br />The plot , such as it is , revolves around a young woman named Faith ( Meg Tilly ) , who is an artist , who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very , very wealthy , older widowed woman , and a growing mother / daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her.<br /><br />It turns out the older woman 's daughter , Cassandra , is dead . You can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together.<br /><br />Even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two . Why he 's still hanging around years after Cassandra 's death is a good question.<br /><br />There 's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant , a faithful butler who seems to do everything -- cooking , cleaning , serving the meal , answering the door , etc . Everything except apparently locking the door -- since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where Faith is.<br /><br />There 's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms , and leaning forward on the edge of your seat , because there IS no " mounting " tension in this film -- just bland , pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time.<br /><br / >
0 I enjoy a good , slow - moving drama . Christmas In August , Chungking Express , Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors , The Way Home , Springtime in a Small Town , Hana bi , Eat Drink Man Woman , Dolls , In the Mood for Love , and Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring are all enjoyable films  just to name a few . < br /><br />Unfortunately , there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves . These are what I call IAN films  " Incomprehensible Artistic Nonsense . " Tsai Ming - liang is the king of this subgenre , and Vive L'Amour is his " masterpiece . " In fact , this is the crème de la crème of crap - infested garbage under the guise of " art . " People walk around in their apartments , drink water , stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant , hang posters , staple papers together , go to the bathroom , eat , do pushups , have sex , slap at mosquitoes , etc . I 'm not joking when I say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film , which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art - house trash . There is no plot , no storyline , no interesting or noteworthy events , no emotion , no meaningful dialogue , and most importantly  no drama.<br /><br />The most eventful scene has two people " banging " on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress  ironic that it 's also totally tasteless and gratuitous . The relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non - existent . Tsai apparently did n't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to " bang . " The person under the bed is just as one - dimensional and uninteresting . He likes to drink water , makeout with melons , and stroke himself . This is Tsai 's idea of " character development . " A truly misguided " entertainer " indeed.<br /><br />Tsai 's true contribution in Vive L'Amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art - house film history . He first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds , only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another 356 consecutive seconds . The film then abruptly ends . No point . No entertainment . Just pure , concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer . < br /><br />In an effort to beat a dead horse . The underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom . In fact , Kiyoshi Kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film Kairo . And guess what ? It 's actually INTERESTING ! That film moved as slow as molasses in January , but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as Vive L'Amour . Kairo is a perfect example of that.<br /><br />Fans of cinema may thank Tsai Ming - liang for directing this film , as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art - house cinema can be just as poorly made as B - grade , made - for - television horror flicks . Art - house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self - righteousness . The quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like Army of Darkness and  gasp !  Showgirls . How do you like them apples ?
0 I suppose it 's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this . With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films , we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions , foul language , and corny one - liners . Minimalism has its place , and can be very effective when employed properly . However , this film is not one of those cases.<br /><br />Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary , sparse scenery . I 'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight , because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement . The acting is poor ... bland and pedestrian ... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history ( at the end of the film , if you can sit through it to the end ) . The scenery is drab , and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled . I would call this anticlimatic , but as the film did n't build to any sort of climax whatsoever ... not even in the " erotic " scenes ... it would be untrue . I 'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming , but with the amount of dialogue , I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin . Basically , this film offers nothing to interest or amaze ... no great story , no stunning insights , no visual drama , no excitement . Apart from two or three amusing moments , this film is a waste of two hours . A tragically boring and dreary film .
0 There are pretty landscape shots . Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths . With lesser actors this show would be silly . ' Art must uplift humanity or it 's BS . ' Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side . The lead character even says those who do n't drink hide the shadow side . Wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes . There was n't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain . All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes . The discussions between the characters was grade school , trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted . I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here . I had to dig deep to see those i agreed with . I figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie . I was moved only once towards the end . The kid was way too passive . The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous . Just my opinion but nowhere show for me .
0 This movie was a major disappointment on direction , intellectual niveau , plot and in the way it dealt with its subject , painting . It is a slow moving film set like an episode of Wonder Years , with appalling lack of depth though . It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.<br /><br />The approach to the subject of painting is very elite , limited to vague and subjective terms as " beauty " . According to the makers of this movie , ' beauty ' can be only experienced in Bob - Ross - style kitschy landscape paintings . Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic ( like , primary school level ) color theory and lots of sentiment . In parts the movie is offending , e.g. at a point it is stated ( rather , celebrated by dancing on tables ) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting , their works by definition being worthless ' bullshit ' ( quote).<br /><br />I do not understand how the movie could get such high rating , then again , so far not many people rated it , and they chose for only very high or very low grades .
0 As gently as I can , I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time . I did not find it the ' warm , emotionally satisfying ' film others did . I found it boring , with music that distracted from the film . The story was thin , the characters overdrawn , and the direction pedestrian.<br /><br />Fooey.<br /><br />Now I 'm going to write some more about this movie , so I make the 10 line minimum . There really is n't more to be said and brevity is important , but IMDb has its minimums , so here goes.<br /><br />Young eager kid finds nascent talent , seeks time with aging , embittered mentor in spite of father 's cartoonish homophobia . Aging , embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little . conflict arises . While I do n't think this is a spoiler , I 've added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much . < br /><br />Mostly , I just found the film boring and pretentious . A waste of my time . I honestly do n't understand what little fuss there seems to be , mostly on this web site , about the transcendent quality of this movie . I think it 's really worth avoiding . But , as Dennis Miller used to say , " Maybe I 'm wrong . "
0 I enjoyed the movie very much , emotionally , intellectually , and visually . It contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects , and does n't need them one bit , holding my attention the entire time with the visuals , story , and interspersed words of wisdom.<br /><br />However : [ 1 ] some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear & understand ; [ 2 ] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing ( especially the F - word , which is the only reason this movie was rated R ) . [ 3 ] The movie is balanced with humor and emotion , but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film , except the final resolution last minutes , is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long - lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss , living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long . [ 4 ] I will not recommend this movie because of 5-seconds of background narration , which did not add one bit to the side - character it applied to , or the film -- it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward : the main character 's mother of German ancestry , when watching old WWII movies , " secretly roots for the Germans . " There would be no " local color " or art if the Nazi 's won the war . I do n't know of any Germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazi 's won WWII .
0 I wanted so much to enjoy this movie . It moved very slowly and was just boring . If it had been on TV , it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes , maybe . What happened to the story ? A great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation . If this is loosely based on the life of the director , why did n't he get someone to see that the writing itself was " loose " . Then he directed it at a snail 's pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie . The music soars , but for a different film , not this one .... for soap opera saga possibly . There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl was speaking . I was not alone , because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom . Why ca n't Hollywood make better movies ? This one had the nugget of a great story , but was just poorly executed .
0 WHITE CHICKS Hold on , why could n't they have dressed as Black Chicks , oh yeah , they would n't look different at all . Can anyone give me one Wayans movie where they have n't dressed up as ladies ? Do n't Be A Menace does n't count , Jack White and Michael Costanza ghost wrote that ( the other Norton Trio members acted as Directors).<br /><br />In White Chicks , there 's never really any jokes . It 's just the Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours . There 's no setups , no punchlines and no laughs . There is a lot of " I think I 'm gon na play some Time Crisis 3 . " At least for me there was ( 5 times to be exact).<br /><br />Somebody has to tell Kenan Ivory , Damon , Marlon , Shawn , Damien ( the only talented one ) , Kim , Rakeesha , George W. , and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies . Its only hurting the O - Zone layer.<br /><br />VERDICT 1/2 * out of * * * *
0 I do n't often go out of my way to write comments , but for this I had to , just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy . This does n't come close . While the premise ( change in colour / gender / whatever ) is bad enough ( and has been done , better , many times before)the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen . It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks . However the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women . As you will have guessed by now , they fail completely . I have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make - up people that Hollywood can provide . Its appalling . Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building , terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low . And I like bad movies ! Avoid like the plague .
0 Basically this is an overlong , unfunny , action / comedy . First of all I 'd like to say that I did enjoy the Wayans brother Scary Movie ( 1 ) and the sequel had it 's moments . Unfortunately white chicks does n't even deliver HALF the laughs . < br /><br />The humour in it is absolutely crude . If you like burping , farting , stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this . When it is n't crude it 's idiotic . The first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me , totally unfunny , simply idiotic . < br /><br />However I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend ( otherwise I would n't have bothered ) . The story is undeniably thin , it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant . I think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film , the laughs do n't come quick enough . Some jokes are dragged out too long when they 're more disgusting than funny in the first place . If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this . If you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie , airplane , hotshots 1 + 2 . < br /><br />1/10 Completely unfunny , Thin storyline , A film that seems to be based on one idea ( i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film ? ) but simply did n't have enough material .
0 Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors , i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films . he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie . scary movie 2 was OK too but everything else Keenan has made are real disasters . avoid such titles like do n't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood ..... i know , what a title ! ! ! obviously this film too , just anything that has Keenans name in the credits.<br /><br />it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh . just trust me on this , maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films ........ 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
0 I * loved * the original Scary Movie . I 'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor . It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor . The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film , then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel . I think the Wayans ' are a family of comical geniuses . Alas , even geniuses make mistakes.<br /><br />The movie begins with promise . I liked " The Exorcist " parody , especially the " come on out , ma " gag . Now , that 's Wayans - quality material . But , other than that , I can only think of two other times I laughed : 1 ) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit , then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him . Meanwhile , he 's saying , " It was just a booty call ! ! " That was kinda funny . 2 ) The " Save the Last Dance " parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves . But even the short - lived giggles are no match for the side - splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is pure trash , filled with cheap gross - out gags . Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone . For example , in Scary Movie I , several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay . This was hilarious . But , in Scary Movie II , the whole penis - strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind - numbing and incredibly unfunny . This is the pattern of the whole film . Shock humor * alone * does n't take a movie very far . This was a trend in 2000 and 2001 , unfortunately . < br /><br />As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low , I have to give this one a 2 out of 10 .
0 Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films , for there is not much of a plot , bad acting , pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes . But . And this is a big but , there is one good actor , one good recurring joke , and a good beginning . The good actor being Tim Curry , the one good recurring joke is the creepy , weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things . And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist.<br /><br />The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion , but will they survive the night ? This film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it !
0 " Scary Movie 2 " is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise . Scary Movie 1 , 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny . Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.<br /><br />This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night . Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.<br /><br />This movie is n't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things . It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I do n't think you will like it nearly as much .
0 Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment . Simply referencing movies , like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy . The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter . The movie plummets from there unfortunately . The acting is awful . Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place . The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced . Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie , involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie , were nt funny to anyone in my theater . The movie , thankfully , comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending . ( I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor ) I do nt know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers . Overall , a very poorly done movie .
0 I was very disappointed by this movie . I thought that " Scary Movie " although not a great movie was very good and funny . " Scary Movie 2 " on the other hand was boring , not funny , and at times plain stupid.<br /><br />The Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie . James Woods was great.<br /><br />Now , I 'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first , where I had basically seen them all . But bad comedy is still bad comedy.<br /><br />Something that really hurt this movie was the timing , which ruined some of what might have been good jokes . Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.<br /><br />Also , the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again . For example , the talking bird . Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time . But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying . The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson ( Chris Elliott ) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.<br /><br />Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie . For example , the ' creaming ' I guess you would call it of Cindy ( Anna Faris ) was funny in " Scary Movie " because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long , that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he ' creamed ' her . But this time around it was out of place and not funny.<br /><br />The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around . The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.<br /><br />Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.<br /><br />But I did enjoy Shorty ( Marlon Wayans ) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film . The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I love the Wayans family and their humor . That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes .
0 I know a few things that are worst . A few . It had a couple of funny scenes . It is a movie not appropriate for kids but , only a child would find this movie hilarious . This is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for . Do n't waste your money just to laugh a couple of times .
0 The first one was different and funny . This attempt should have never left the studio . This movie does not make you laugh . It is a weak attempt at gross out humor . The movie picks out current and old movies to rip - off . This time the jokes seem used and overdone . The audience that I saw it with only re - acted to Hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep .
0 The script for " Scary Movie 2 " just was n't ready to go . This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident , to the actors and the audience alike . Director Keenan Ivory Wayans , and many of the actors are funny people ; and so the movie is n't completely humorless . To their credit , the film has several funny moments . But as a whole , " Scary Movie 2 " is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.<br /><br />The first " Scary Movie " was a laugh a minute film . It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold . The humor in " Scary Movie 2 " is as heavy handed as it is un - original . They even miss obvious opportunities for parody . Two of the movies stars are former cast members of " Beverly Hills 90210 , " and this was a show that was begging to be parodied ! In the final analysis , " Scary Movie 2 " is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon . The script needed a lot more time to age . 2 stars out of 5 .
0 Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness ( 81 minutes - including end credits , so roughly 76 minutes of actual film ) . But what it can not explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed.<br /><br />The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny . The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots , James Woods ' portrayal of Max Van Sydow 's character in the Exorcist , and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film . Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie 's Angels , which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.<br /><br />Today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' Poltergeist , et . al.<br /><br />Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris ( whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . Just for her casting and acting ability , I give this movie a " 3 " out of " 10 " .
0 After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes . Though i guess not . If the first one was n't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch . With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever . Though they could n't , they had to take all the same raunchy , not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again . Though the thing is i did n't laugh at it the first time . They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level . Most of the time it 's just randomly inserted jokes , that are so disgusting and raunchy that it 's hard to watch it and enjoy it . Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene . Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience , well i fit into the age range that it 's supposed to be funny for . While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not , if you do find this funny then you probably are n't one of the more mature or intelligent people around . It does n't take that much skill to write that kind of a script , though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs . It 's a movie parody that 's actually good and well done and it did n't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either .
0 Alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money I'll < br /><br />kick you were it counts and you 'll have the same amount of fun . I'll < br /><br />even guarantee more fun . This movie once again shows what happens when < br /><br />you ca n't get any one else to hire your family and your forced to make < br /><br />your own movies . Same , I 'm going through puberty humor jokes , just < br /><br />dumber and grosser . This movie is really a disgrace to movie goers . They < br /><br />try to shock you into laughing because you ca n't believe the levels they < br /><br />have to stoop to make you laugh . So my offer above stands as
0 As if there were n't enough of those floating around at the time already , we have here another lame GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI ( 1973 ) which I had watched earlier this year . The marquee - value name roped in this time is Telly Savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind , rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters ! Apart from not looking minimally Sicilian , he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl . Antonio Sabato , then , makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man ; his relationship with Savalas , which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye , is also unconvincing ( especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter 's spirited teenage niece ) ! Besides , for a gangster flick , there 's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable ( though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled ) ; furthermore , the score by Francesco De Masi is serviceable but nothing else . Incidentally , the bargain - basement DVD I rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the film 's title - is ever listed !
0 Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel . I do n't know how he came up with this film ! The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful , that makes it 2 out of ten . But this is not a movie . Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west - east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped . And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen . And the background music says " ... I will pray".The thing is not about religion actually . But it ends up with this . How you are gon na see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . The lights are already shining on the truth . Its just that nobody wants to see it . ps : " My home is not a place . It is people"The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence . But it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; as " someone " mentioned below , Americas finest young man are not finest , they are just the " poor " and the " hopeless " ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! )
0 The hysterical thing about this movie is that , according to the director , it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them that viewed it could n't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst . The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable.<br /><br />Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone " Godspeed " this makes it a " Christian " movie ? One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the " Land of Plenty " with all of its material excess , the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse . Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe ? Plenty of useless homeless missions ? How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets ? As a pill - popping delusional survivor of agent " pink " are we to think America is a " Land of Plenty " of paranoid patriots ? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients ? Certainly we do n't have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film . Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the " Continent of Plenty " when it comes to sophistication.<br /><br />Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the " Land of Plenty " and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts , amateur acting and dispassionately directed films . Life is too short and one , even an American , does n't have " plenty " of time to waste watching this piece .
0 " Land of Plenty " is not a film . It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Wim Wenders.<br /><br />Many felt it in " The Million Dollar Hotel " and now " Land of Plenty " makes it perfectly clear ; not only has Wenders lost it , he 's actually turned into a BAD director , creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes.<br /><br />One might argue that the " time you lose it " comes for every director , but Wenders ' case is extreme . It 's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results.<br /><br />In a few words , this film does not deserve your time .
0 How wonderful . Yet another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times , a day a piece , and believes himself to be an " expert " on the country . Sheesh . I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the " land of Nazis " or some such . Wim IL boy , you should get together with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans . Of course we all know it takes a pretentious left - leaning " we are the world " European to make a " real " movie about America.<br /><br />Yeah , right . For a continent that started not one but TWO world wars , Europe sure has a lot of opinions about America 's wrong " foreign policy".<br /><br />P.S. Do n't worry , Wim IL boy , there 's plenty of UC - Berkeley Americans that 'll just love your movie . Of course , these are the same people who thinks George W. Bush is worst than Hitler , and that a painting of a can of soup is " sheer genius " ! !
0 Robert Forster , normally a very strong character actor , is lost at sea here cast as a New York family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion . Scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the " Death Wish " vein . It is n't difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings : the dialogue is full of howlers , the crime statistics are irrevocably dated , and the supporting characters are ridiculously over - written ( particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom ) . Low - rent production is contemptible in its self - righteousness , especially as the violence in our cities has only increased . * from * * * *
0 A police officer ( Robert Forster ) in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station . After the murderers get off scot - free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court , he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking Fred Williamson . These Robin Hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute , and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged him .. <br /><br />This film is nothing but a big bag o'clichés . The only thing out of the ordinary is the on - screen slaying of a two year old boy , which was pretty sick . Otherwise it 's business as usual for this genre e.g involves lots of car chases , beatings and shootings mixed in with plenty of male posturing . I could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare - a**ed inmates , though . Also , did they run out of money before filming the last scenes ? I mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure . If anyone knows , give me a bell .. actually , do n't bother.<br /><br />To conclude : File under " Forgettable Nonsense " . Next ..
0 William Lustig 's followup to " Maniac " proves conclusively that , without Tom Savini 's spectacular effects and Spinell 's convincing performance , " Maniac " would never have become the cult hit that it did . " Vigilante " is badly directed , with a simple - minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn , and also mediocre performances by all the actors . Judging from the sense of " deja vu " this film gave me , Lustig had watched " Death Wish " several times too many before making this ! ( * 1/2 )
0 Before I start , I _ love _ Eddie Izzard . I think he 's one of the funniest stand - ups around today . Possibly that means I 'm going into this with too high expectations , but I just did n't find Eddie funny in this outing.<br /><br />I think the main problem is Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie . Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic , and we all love him for it . But in Circle , he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny , and completely lost me in places . Many of the topics he covers he has covered before - I even think I recognised a few recycled jokes in there.<br /><br />If you buy the DVD you 'll find a behind - the - scenes look at Eddie 's tour ( interesting in places , but not very funny ) , and a French language version of one of his shows . Die - hards will enjoy seeing Eddie in a different language , but subtitled comedy is n't very funny.<br /><br />If you 're a fan of Eddie you 've either got this already or you 're going to buy it whatever I say . If you 're just passing through , buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you wo n't be disappointed . With Circle , you probably will .
0 Oh my God what the hell happened here ? ! ! I 'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this ? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in " King Kong vs Godzilla",Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy . Its about some villain called Dr . Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong . When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes . Then Dr . Who sends the robot after him.<br /><br />Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning . As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight . The ending has to be a really bad one because they could 've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.<br /><br />Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do ... beware of the disappointment you will receive .
0 KING KONG VS . GODZILLA ( 1963 ; which I recall having rated BOMB ) had been my introduction to cult director Honda 's work ; this one is n't necessarily better  it 's just that I 've learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare ! < br /><br />Here , we actually get two Kongs for the price of one : an ugly and dopey - looking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse ! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo ( ! )  where it 's shown fighting a couple of other monsters , and befriends a trio of humans . Naturally , it falls for the blonde ( and bland ) heroine ; in fact , more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the film 's villainous mad genius  called Dr. Who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampire!!<br /><br />He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the Element X , which is embedded in the icy wastes of the North Pole ; apparently , the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart ( and , to ensure its full co - operation , Who even captures its three ' companions ' ) ! The female agent then has a change of heart , helps the heroes ( one of whom , typically , is a nondescript American ) and is killed by Who . Kong eventually escapes and makes it to Tokyo , where it has a final showdown with the robot . The doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub  which , on a request by Kong 's dreamgirl , is summarily trashed by the giant ape .
0 * * May Contain Spoilers**<br /><br />A dude in a dopey - looking Kong suit ( the same one used in KING KONG VS . GODZILLA in 1962 ) provides much of the laffs in this much - mocked monster flick . Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around . The vampire - like villain is named Dr. Who-funny , he does n't look like Peter Cushing ! Kong finally dukes it out with Who 's pride and joy , a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla . Like many of Honda 's flicks this may have had some merit before American audiences diddled around with it and added new footage . The Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess . They should have stuck to superior children 's programs like The Little Drummer Boy .
0 Sadly , the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at Universal Studios last week , so we were stuck with video . That could even be a metaphor for this second - rate King Kong movie from Toho studios ' stalwart director Ishiro Honda . Essentially it 's a warm up for " King Kong versus Godzilla " . It even uses the idea of a Mecha - Kong , like Mecha - Godzilla . Of course the movie climaxes with King Kong fighting Mecha - Kong on top of the expo tower in Tokyo , but if you did n't know that already then maybe you 're in the age group that this movie was intended for.<br /><br />The cast is headed by a guy named Rhodes Reason who we had never heard of ... glancing over his list I see mostly a lot of scattered American TV credits , so it 's interesting that they dragged him all the way to Japan so that they could have a nominal American hero . The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada , who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagaki 's iconic version of " Chushingura " ( 47 Ronin ) and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda . I 'm sorry Rhodes Reason whoever you are , but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde , played by Linda Miller . We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada , who it seemed like she kind of preferred . Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself . She discovers a nice trick : if you talk to a giant ape really ..... really .... slowly ..... he 'll understand what you 're saying . And if you 're a blonde gal , that means that he 'll do whatever you tell him to do . That fact is not lost on Dr. Who ( Eisei Amamoto ) and Madame Piranha ( Mie Hama ) -- representing a " nation which shall not be named " -- who plan on using her as bait to get Kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the North Pole.<br /><br />Yes , this is truly the plot of the whole movie -- apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons . Dr. Who builds Mecha - Kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way , so they decide to go for the real Kong . Kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with Mecha - Kong , a story element that might have made the film more interesting but was n't followed up on.<br /><br />By the end of the movie , the cute blonde has shouted " Kong " or " King Kong " in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they 're speaking for all of us . Basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the Kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early , just like the newest version of the story . Kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie , and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously . It 's a nice looking movie , I 'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing , which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways . The monsters do n't ever really scare in these films , they just jump around and push each other around a lot . It 's not a worthless movie , but it 's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy .
0 It 's the worst movie I 've ever seen . The action is so unclear , work of cameras is so poor , actors are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen . My advice from the bottom of my heart - do n't watch it unless you like such a low class torture .
0 From the first time I saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography I thought this guy , this friend of the ' Scwarz ' must be like 6 foot or 6 ft 2 in . < br /><br />Not 5 feet tall . Not that , it 's his fault . < br /><br />At any rating , I turned on the movie one cool night in Tucson , out on the second story - deck with a good cigar and let it roll . At that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me , so I needed a good diversion . But , as bad as the movie was ... I totally enjoyed it , with a bottle of Merlot too , I might admit . < br /><br />Truly , I have watched this movie many times . It always makes me feel good ! ! It 's not that it ' tries too hard ' to be cool or that ' It 's so close ' to hitting the mark for an action film .... It 's frantic . And then truly clueless . Then frantic again . It 's the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene . Wow ! ! I never felt safer in my life . Warm and happy too . I was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase , due to less production in the summer months ... anywho < br /><br />The direction was ' uninspired ' the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed , or re - choreographed and tightened up , the sound was off the delivery did n't hit you , it just kept on going , the other way . The ' locals ' of that village that they were in , the town rather , were ' Off cue ' they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well , the would look and even ' stare ' into the camera lens . Like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile , a smiling deer . < br /><br />I feel bad because ' Columbu ' I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own countrymen . < br /><br />However " Baretta 's Island " is very lethargic and unbelievable . Even still I like it a lot . My now x - wife hates it , but I love it ! < br /><br />The funny thing is , I am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even ' love ' . All in all , I like Franco . So there it is . < br /><br />As a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch , straight to video - B movies or ' bad ' movies for your little library collection then , if you can find it , check out ' The Big Sweat ' ( 1991 ) with Robert Z ' Dar .. you know the big guy from ' TANGO & CASH ' . ' The Big Sweat ' , a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame , it might as well be ' on crutches ' and at the end of ' The Big Sweat ' I think they ran out of money , because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits . -Good fun . < br /><br />But all in all , not as good as Baretta 's Island ' , I gave it a ' 1 ' and an overall rating of ' awful ' for awful - good B ' movie . I 'm waiting for the sequel , maybe like ' Baretta 's revenge on Montazuma ' ( Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then , declares war on the water co. ) or ' Baretta 's powder war ' where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene - splice and create a hybrid super bug ( insect ) that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug , it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar . Then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on . He could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature . Right ? ( * )
0 Very funny to watch " Beretta 's Island " as kind of natural trash - film . It is like answer to Jess Franko 's type of b - movie . Bodybuilders strikes back ( ! face to face ! ) to pushers . The very very very stupid strike!Action : unbelievably bad directed firing(shooting ) scenes look even better than hand - to - hand fighting . Chasing scenes ridiculous . Saving beauties scenes incredibly stupid . Erotic scenes are very unerotic . The main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenes . Don't miss : Arnold Schwarzenegger 's joke at start of film and list of Franco Columbu 's kin at the end . Special attraction : naked bosom . Almoust forgot - Franco can sing !
0 To make any film about the supposed end of the world , there should be some facts & realism 1 . We are never told why these people believe this . 2.Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada . SO PLEASE SOME ONE TELL ME WHY WAS THEN STILL SHINING AT MIDNIGHT & WHY(based on the costumes ) DID IT SEEM LIKE SEPTEMBER < br /><br />3 . The acting was in that neo - au - natural style , that needed a director who knew how to do it.<br /><br />4 . the individual story pieces were all dreary & without any purpose . I could go on , But I do not want to make this as boring as the film.<br /><br / > rating * 1/2 ( out of 4 ) 2 on IMDB scale < br /><br />thank you I am as always < br /><br / > JAY HARRIS ( aka)SIRBOSSMAN
0 The world may have ended . Unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to Canada 's inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable . Maybe it 's because all our really good people ( Norman Jewison , Martin Short et al ) go to Hollywood . ) In fact it 's too bad Short was n't cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film . He might have given it some credibility . The Canadian government should realize --- and this movie is a magnificent example --- that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema . If the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete , they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile . As it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment .
0 Watching Josh Kornbluth ' act ' in this movie reminds me of my freshman TV production class , where the ' not funny ' had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were!<br /><br />OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try to synopsize this wannabe comedy . The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed . The delivery is painfully bad . OUCH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The writing is simply dorkish . It is akin to a Bob Saget show . < br /><br />Watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long Saturday Night Live skit ( post Belushi ) . < br /><br />I hated this movie and want my money back ! ! !
0 I 'll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona , because quite frankly , to draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth , is just an insult to any such director . I will also avoid mentioning the spot - on satire ` Office Space ' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe . I can , however , compare it to waking up during your own surgery  it 's painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they 're doing . Haiku Tunnel is the kind of film you wish they 'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production . It was cruel to let it live and as a result , audiences around the world are being made to suffer.<br /><br />The film 's premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing , but for the sake of caution I will . Josh Kornbluth , a temp worker with severe commitment - phobia , is offered a permanent job . His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss . But ludicrously , he is unable to perform this simple task . My reaction ? Big deal ! That 's not a story   it 's a passing thought at best - one that should 've passed any self - respecting filmmaker by . < br /><br />The leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man , with chubby features , a receding , untamed hairline , and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe - making to plain disturbing . Where o where did the director find this schmuck ? What 's that you say   he is the director ? Oh , my mistake . Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing , but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth is n't that convincing as a human being , let alone an actor . Rest assured , this is by no means an aimless character assassination , but never before have I been so riled up by an actor 's on - screen presence ! My frustration was further confounded by his incessant to - camera monologues in between scenes . I mean , as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel , Kornbluth insults us further by ` explaining ' the action ( first rule of filmmaking : ` dramatize exposition '   show , do n't tell ) . Who does this guy think he is ? He has no charisma , no charm , and judging by his Hawaiian shirts , no sense of style . His casting agent should be shot point blank!<br /><br />The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt , with but one exception . Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex - secretary , who has been driven insane by her old boss , and makes harassing phone calls from her basement , while holding a flashlight under her face . This did make me chuckle to myself , but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />The film 's title is also a misnomer . Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry . Do n't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious - sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office   there 's a very good reason for that!<br /><br / >
0 The worlds largest inside joke . The world 's largest , most exclusive inside joke.<br /><br />Emulating the brash and ' everyman ' humor of office space , this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary , and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.<br /><br />The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time , listening to music and writing a novel while working . These are his goals . You ca n't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when ( around halfway through ) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria , but then gives it UP ! The director and screenwriter ( Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth ) completely remove the audience 's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof.<br /><br />Apart from that major stumbling block , the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . Without these asides , the audience would n't have noticed anything particularly strange . Humor is only effective if it does n't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny .
0 After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep , I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation . This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it . What a mistake!<br /><br />Here is the plot ( potential spoilers , if you even care ) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy ( Josh Kornbluth ) works as a temp for some ridiculous company . Suddenly , he is offered the chance to " go perm , " which seems to be the favorite catch - phrase of this movie . But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp , Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he does n't want to do it . He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt . His inability to send several " very important " letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious , but is merely stupid . Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together ( obviously a fantasy of Josh 's in real life , as such a thing would never happen ) . A bunch of other stuff happens , but it 's too trite and inane to go into now.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy , I only laughed twice during it ; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth ( my initial reaction was one of stifling fear ) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman ( yeah , right ) . Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying - looking person I have ever seen in my life . He is an unattractive , overweight , balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women . I do not at all sympathize with Josh 's character . He is lazy and unmotivated and I just do n't appreciate the failed attempts at humor . Skip it , even if your life depends upon it .
0 I passed this one on the shelf a few times , looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes ( with tiny names ) on the front and wondering if I was missing something . The other night it was on one of the movie channels , and I tuned in . I missed nothing.<br /><br />I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes . Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that . Given the slow , plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 , I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />The lead character starts the movie in classic " I do n't know how to start my movie " style , with a long , tiresome monologue about how he does n't want to get sued . It 's not funny . It 's not even remotely funny . Others have commented on the " San Franclisco " bit ; ok , a small chuckle the first time he says it . Then he grinds it into the ground , smiling at the camera like it 's the funniest thing ever written . Get over yourself . In fact , I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film . Do n't assume familiarity with your audience . Familiarity is _ earned _ , much like respect.<br /><br />From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp . I did n't realize he 's Jewish ; it 's a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this " Jewish humor " . It 's just unfunny humor . Just because you 're Jewish does n't mean you have a knack for the comedy . A WASP , Spalding Gray , does a better job of self - analytical humor than this guy , so obviously it 's not about ethnicity.<br /><br />If one of the bits I had seen had worked , I might have stuck around . But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with , then listing them for five long minutes , does n't make a great movie.<br /><br />This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of " Office Space " . Do n't let yourself become a victim of target marketing . Just say no to " Haiku Tunnel " .
0 This movie is nothing like " Office Space " except in the premise . Office Space was hilarious . I would not recommend this movie to anyone , as I laughed not once during the entire film . Mr. Cornbluth 's self - indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room . If you decide to see this movie , use a free rental or watch it at someone else 's house so you can leave if necessary .
0 Office work , especially in this era of computers , multi - functional copy machines , e - mail , voice mail , snail mail and ` temps , ' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities , a vein previously tapped in such films as ` Clockwatchers ' and ` Office Space , ' and very successfully . This latest addition to the temp / humor pool , however , ` Haiku Tunnel , ' directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth , fails to live up to it 's predecessors , and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door , waiting for a chance to sneak in . Unfortunately for the audience , that chance never comes ; so what you get is a nice try , but as the man once said , no cigar.<br /><br / > 	 As the narrator / star of the film , Josh Kornbluth ( playing Josh Kornbluth ) , points out in the opening frames ( in a monologue delivered directly into the camera ) , this story is pure fiction , and takes place in the fictional city of ` San Franc'l'isco . ' It 's an innovative , if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer , and not all that funny . It is , however , a harbinger of what is to follow , all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just is n't all that funny.<br /><br / > 	 Kornbluth plays Kornbluth , an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a ` temp . ' It 's a job that suits him , and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time . But when he goes to work for a lawyer , Bob Shelby ( Warren Keith ) , he does too good a job on the first day , and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina D'Amore ( Helen Shumaker ) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go ` perm . ' The thought of working full time for the same company , though , initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth , but he caves in and signs on for the position . He 's nervous about it , but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence ( which , of course , they would never do with a temp ) , and if things get too rough , he has seventeen important letters he 's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on ( he 's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part , and he needs that ` something easy to do ' in reserve , in case it all gets to be too much for him ) . These are ` important ' letters , however , and by the end of the week , Kornbluth still has them in reserve , on his desk . And it does n't take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it , Kornbluth 's days as the fair - haired boy are going to be over . And quick.<br /><br / > 	 The Brothers Kornbluth , who not only directed , but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film , should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy , where it says ` If you play it straight , they will laugh . ' But , they did n't , and the audience wo n't . Because in comedy , even looking at it as objectively as possible , when the main character ( as well as most of the supporting characters , in this case ) ` Plays ' funny-- as in , he ` knows ' he 's being funny-- he never is . And that 's exactly what Kornbluth does here ; so rather than being ` funny , ' he comes across as insincere and pretentious , a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths , because by allowing it , they sabotaged their own movie . < br /><br / > 	 In trying to discern exactly why this movie does n't work , it comes down to two basic reasons : The directing , which-- if not necessarily ` bad'-- is at least careless ; and secondly , the performances , beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth . Quite simply , Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here . Unlike Stiller , or even Steve Martin-- both of whom use self - deprecating humor very effectively-- Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light ; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he , the real Kornbluth , is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character . And being unable to get past that does him in , as well as the film . Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify , Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach . So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting , and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with , with an inexplicably narrow focus ( given the potential of the rich subject matter ) , it 's easy to understand why this one just does n't fly.<br /><br / > 	 The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby , whose subtle delivery is convincing , and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous . The effectiveness of it is diminished , however , inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth , which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project . < br /><br / > 	 Shumaker and Sarah Overman ( Julie Faustino ) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances , which are commendable , if not entirely memorable ; they at least make their scenes watchable , and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth 's performance , if only momentarily . But it 's still not enough to save the day or the film.<br /><br / > 	 The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick ( Mindy ) , Brian Thorstenson ( Clifford ) , June Lomena ( DaVonne ) , Joe Bellan ( Jimmy the Mail Clerk ) , with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer , as the Orientation Leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question , ` What was he thinking when he agreed to this ? ' In any work environment , there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone 's comedic cannon , and the films depicting said situations will always be with us ; the good ones ( see paragraph one ) may even become classics in their own right . ` Haiku Tunnel , ' however , will doubtfully remain very long amongst them , for it 's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as : ` Obscurity . ' I rate this one 1/10 . < br /><br / > < br /><br / >
0 My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and " Office Space " . Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an " also recommended " selection if you liked " Office Space".<br /><br />Now , I 've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times . I love it . It 's probably one of my 10 favorite movies . Witty , humorous , and featuring characters that remind me of people I 've worked with over the years . " Haiku Tunnel " is similar to " office Space " in that they are both films . That 's where the similarity ends . We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT , giving it the benefit of the doubt , hoping , nay , * praying * that it would get better . It did n't . We could n't take it any more , and stopped the tape . Thank GOD it was a free rental . I 'd have been p***ed if we 'd actually paid for it . We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it . Now , since we did n't see the end , perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself . I doubt it.<br /><br />Haiku Tunnel is so bad it 's hard to believe it ever got produced . The movie is SO unfunny it 's painful . Just mail the friggin letters already ! ! ! The premise is asinine . The jokes are awful . We got as far as the " printer does n't work " scene and had to stop . We could n't take it anymore . This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Office Space ...... don't waste your time with this turd . 0/10
0 Really , when it comes down to it , this movie is just not funny . Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of funny , and yet he thinks he 's hilarious . The plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first , until Josh 's " look at me , I 'm wacky " approach began infesting each and every scene . The Judas Priest joke may have been the least funny thing I have ever been privy to , and that is saying quite a bit , since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie . And as for the incredible overuse of the Pixies ' " Debaser , " I have just one thing to say : What did the Pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this ? What did anyone do to Josh Kornbluth to cause him to write / direct / produce / star in such a terrible movie ?
0 I think this is almost all I need to say . I feel obliged to explain my actions though . I 've basically never seen such an armature production , and I mean that in all senses of the word . Although he physical camera work , boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable , unfortunately its not the only areas . < br /><br />Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot , this unfortunately has an awful script , awful acting and worst of all , awful annoying characters . < br /><br />It 's a crime that for the every independent film that gets , distribution like Haiku Tunnel , there 's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths . I do n't know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony , but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution . I 'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up.<br /><br />The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title . However , the reason for that is even a let down . I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it . I 've seen a lot of films in my time , and I 'm very forgiving when in the cinema , but this was too much . I 'll never forget ' tunnel ' , for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema . Shame it 's such a low point .

Although the physical camera work , boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable , unfortunately its not the only areas.<br /><br />Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot , this unfortunately has an awful script , awful acting and worst of all , awful annoying characters.<br /><br />It 's a crime that for the every independent film that gets , distribution like Haiku Tunnel , there 's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths . I do n't know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony , but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution . I 'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up.<br /><br />The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title . However , the reason for that is even a let down . I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it . I 've seen a lot of films in my time , and I 'm very forgiving when in the cinema , but this was too much . I 'll never forget ' tunnel ' , for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema . Shame it 's such a low point.<br /><br / >
0 Mmm , does n't a big stack of pancakes sound good ? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top . Take a bite . Mmmmmmm . Take another bite . Another . Another . EAT . EAT it , you ! ! ! Keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea . You have just had the Ally McBeal experience.<br /><br />I stumbled on this show in the winter of ' 98 and was instantly hooked . Like that stack of pancakes , I gorged myself on it . But the enjoyment soon wore off , because the Ally McBeal character ( whom we see to be cute & endearing at first sight ) soon becomes the most annoying , insecure , whining complainer you 've ever met . ( Call me a feminist , but I prefer my female leads to have a spine . ) The gags & gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed , the music of Vonda Shepherd ( which is really shoved in your face ) becomes grating , and the incessant character changes & rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera.<br /><br />My advice to you is to take this show in small doses , and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome ( and it will ) . I made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured . It was good while it lasted , but like a crazy , neurotic ex - girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />And next time you go to IHOP , skip the pancakes . Order something healthy like the fruit cup . It 'll sit with you much better .
0 What the hell is this ? " Kooky drama " ? " Lawyers in Loony Tunes Land " ? The world 's thinnest , most duck - faced actress ( even more duck - faced and anorexic than Michelle Pfeiffer ) overacts her bony butt off , making cretinous grimaces that would shame Bugs Bunny , in one of the most animated non - animated TV series ever . This is also the most annoying one - hour - format TV show ever , hence the worst.<br /><br />All the men act like pansies , and I for one refuse to believe that even hip big - city shysters are all as delta - male - like as this sorry ( short ) bunch . Wuss Peter MacNicol manages to be even more irritating than Calista Flockofducks with his fake Hollywood " shshshs " speech impediment : it 's the sort of pseudo - inability to pronounce the letter " S " by turning it into a moronic " SH " that the likes of Jon Shtewart and Christian Shlater also practice with zeal . Watching MacNicol talk , I always wonder how come his jaw does n't dislocate ... Human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the " SH " sound more than three times per second . He is a medical wonder.<br /><br />This badly conceived and written legal - drama / comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s PC . It has POLITICAL CORRECTNESS written with huge , neon letters . Is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of LAWYERS being full of ideals , high principles , and moral fiber ? Laughable , but that 's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in Hollywood since its inception . After all , what is more noble than defending a murderer , a rapist , or a thief ? When a TV series as retarded as " Ally McBeak " starts preaching to America about how it should run the country , then it must be time for Paris Hilton to become President . " Ally McQuack " is both a product of recent and large - scale Western dumbing - down and a perpetrator of it.<br /><br />Those supposed touches of " eccentricity " , like the UNBELIEVABLY annoying musical numbers , are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny . This is no Monty Python . Whatever " new " the talent - free makers of this garbage were aiming for , they failed with honours . " Ally McBeak " is a highly commercialized TV venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies , bored housewives , and bipolar lawyers . It 's yet another dull " objection overruled sustained your Honour may I call the witness " legalistic baloney that the American audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason ...
0 " Ally McBeal " was a decent enough show , but it was very overrated . The characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short.<br /><br />I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it was starting to outstay its welcome .
0 The only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message.<br /><br />SPOILER : they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions . They blame bears and deer for " misbehaving " by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger .
0 Gregory Peck 's acting was excellent , as one would expect , and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic " moment . " But , the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch , for me anyway . I tried to like it , but had to fast - forward through the last thirty minutes or so . I feel I wasted a couple of good hours . Had it not been for Gregory Peck , I would n't have lasted fifteen minutes . 4/10 .
0 This is the most depressing film I have ever seen . I first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me . I know it was set in a time when life was hard and I know these people were poor and the crops were vital . Yes , I get all that . What I find hard to take is I ca n't remember one single light moment in the entire film . Maybe it was true to life , I do n't know . I 'm quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and I know that every film ca n't have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion.<br /><br />I would n't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film . I ca n't stress enough how this film affected me as a child . I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back . I think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the Prozac .
0 I do n't know if the problem I had with this movie is that I was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but I believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film . If you do n't have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk .
0 At first glance , this movie has got everything a psycho wants : a vampire story with a " not under 18 " restriction , filled with hyper - violence , drugs , gore , sex ( including lesbian sex ) , some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop ! But then , this movie is a succession of bad story ( so thin ) , bad acting -with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you 're watching a bad Monty Python - , bad music ( ' 80s hard rock ) , the videotaping is awful , the ending is a real shame ... Plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous , the gore not very impressive . And those vampires reflect in a mirror , and do n't even fear daylight ! You get to be very disappointed , unless you see it as a " Space Mutiny " or " Troll 2 " . I hope Bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 , because that 's its real place.<br /><br />I'd say it can still be fun to watch , if you have friends and enough beer.<br /><br />3/10
0 I did nt think it was possible , but i have found film worse than ' Body Melt ' . This film is really really bad ! And what makes it worse is that its another Australian film ... <br /><br />Shot on what looks like VHS , and with a terrible 80 's rock soundtrack , it just keep getting worse and worse , which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is ( skinned male hanging up - side - down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone?).<br /><br />And why do their accents keep changing ? From bad New York drawl , to prissy english , then pure Aussie ! And it happens to the whole cast!<br /><br />This film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover ( i believe it was the Utah Film Festival ) . This has to be a lie because no - one in their right mind would nominate this for anything ( perhaps the Golden Rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell).<br /><br />Come on guys ! This film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 ! ! ! It has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there.<br /><br />Well done to the " film " makers of this trash , for proving there is a reason not to see films ..... 0/10
0 First up this film , according to the slick said it won " best film " at " Worldfest " Film festival in Houston , Texas . Hmmm must have been a quiet year.<br /><br />Wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks , is pretty much just as terrible as other Aussie B grader " Body Melt " , but at least that film did n't look like it was shot on HI 8 video.<br /><br />My guess is the film makers , watched a lot of Troma films , and really bad B grade gore films , thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I love really low grade films , Just the fact that some of the characters put on fake American accents , almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something . Really disappointing ending as well , the showdown could have been way more exciting , and some good fight scenes . You can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy " Bad Taste " with the whole , car explosion , rocket launcher , and endless amount of people being gunned down , yet the finale lacks any over the top humour , or style like " bad taste".<br /><br />If you like watching really bad gore films , or are interested in no - budget film making , watch it , otherwise stay away .
0 Big Bad Ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials , and can be found at numerous brothels around Melbourne any given night.<br /><br />Terrible Film by the way , was n't shocking just bad , uninteresting < br /><br />The main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown , and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in Melbourne.<br /><br />I dunno who the women where ? probably pros 's that Ralph knew?<br /><br />No story of interest , its one of those fast forward jobs < br /><br />Please look up Big Bad Ralph at brothels around Melbourne < br /><br />hes famous in them.<br /><br />i wish i could give 0/10 but ill give it 1 . Only cos i ca nt give 0
0 the characters at depth - less rip offs . you 've seen all the characters in other movies , i promise . the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably . it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field , completely forced , and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked . the hot chick is old and has no personality , she s just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non - underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing . the attraction between Molly ( the hot chick ) and Kirk ( the dorky love interest ) is barely communicated . the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt- mishap kiss occurs . afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame . the main focus of this movie is not the relationship , but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super - bad - esquire movie with a semi appealing plot . I could compare this to the hangover , in its forced nature . i wo nt get into that . i could keep going but its just pointless . just do n't pay to see this movie .
0 I thought that this movies was a letdown I expected it to be so much better than it was . I am so glad I did n't pay to see this movie and that I did n't sit in a movie theater for this one . Where to begin on this movie , the acting in this movie was average , the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie was n't special . I thought that this movie was suppose to be great , but it was n't more than a cheesy waste of time . I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry , it just was n't there . I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I did n't get the feeling that he was n't acting in this movie . Now , Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but , there was no chemistry between her and Jay . All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie . The humor in this movie was not funny at all , there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand . I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he could n't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy . I honestly think he needs to stick with the Burger King commercials . I think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director . The storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just OK guy love story  boring I think that it would have been better if it had more originality , but what a letdown nothing . I honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie . I think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie . So save yourself the agony and just do n't see it .
0 This movie probably had some potential for something ; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters , it 's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are . Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs , they return to ingest their own vomit . Well , they 're 19 bucks richer now because of me . This was not at all imaginative , there was no redeeming moment , anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer ( and nothing amusing was in the trailer ) , performances were strained ( especially Molly 's , totally unconvincing ) . What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films ; none of his analogies hit home , his little moral speeches were flat , I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful , only to find out he was done . The so - called " hard 10 " is the most insipid plastic creature there is ( apart from having a horse - like face with a weird smile ) ; I honestly found her friend Patty ( referred to as the Hamburglar ) to be much better looking than her . But then again , gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) Well , anyway , the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades ; the way they showed this , with a dude shaving another 's scrotum and the million - times - mutilated - and - beaten - to - death - horse premature ejaculation routine ( with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog ) . I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage . Goes to show marketing can push anything out there , shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold , people will come ( worked for me ) . Done with tirade .
0 Just saw a pre - screening tonight . What can I say ? It lived up to it 's mediocre trailer run , though that 's saying nothing at all . It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it has n't done , and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience , and instead let the humorless movie play out.<br /><br />So let 's see ... we have the less - than - spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex - girlfriend but he 's not good enough for her , check . We have the three buddies that all have their own " personality " with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character 's best friend but is constantly rejected , another friend being the super awkward one that ca n't live down seeing the positive in everything 24/7 and is thrown in for the one - liners ( which in this case is just a bunch of movie references , specifically from Disney ) , and the third guy whose name you wo n't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen ... check . We have the girl 's ex - boyfriend and her parents * * * * -block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up , not to mention the awkward family members from the main character 's side ... check . We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed , check . We have the movie 's " funny " moments come from incessant swearing , people falling down or being hit , scenes from the trailer , and homosexual innuendos ... check . And dare I call it a spoiler , but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie ... check.<br /><br />Honestly , this could have ... no , wait ... should have been a PG-13 movie . All that needed to be dropped were any F - bombs . Honestly , it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor , would have gotten less media exposure , and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R - rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up . The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it does n't fit in with what general people look for . I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera . Let 's put it this way ... in the theater , it will help you laugh because it 's on the big screen and others are laughing . When this movie hits Showtime and you 're checking it out at 2:00 PM on an off - day , you may be inclined to change the channel . The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve 's hotness ( who is not quite a 10 , but still very good looking).<br /><br />Aside from the main resolution , this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie , where everything else pretty much flies out the window . So there is a main resolution , but what comes of it ? It 's never really clear - cut , nor does it allow the ending to be " feel - good " with the abruptness.<br /><br />There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie , and that was the good soundtrack . Aside from the nice choice of 90 's alternative rock songs , there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie ( more so the beginning of it ) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up / compose . I 'll give them props for a great choice of sound.<br /><br />One last thing , this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer , because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion . I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it . But I say hold onto your money . If this was PG-13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends , I 'd say knock yourselves out . Otherwise , definitely pass . It does n't try and compete with the R - rated movies of the past few years , and ideally it definitely is n't as good .
0 If you have n't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes . Lilia is a widow . She has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out . She has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger . While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared ... the cabaret , where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her . The film is very misogamist . It 's portrayal of men is dismal . Which is rather odd as Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them , not for money , but just for the hell of it . When she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again . She does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention . The other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short - lived . Not short enough I say . She does find romance , however brief , with you guessed it .... No surprises here we did n't see coming . Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way . Maybe this film just is n't targeting my demographic- 30 Male
0 Well , you 'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish , bland , and pokey flick about a middle - aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like . Set in Tunis , mom piddles around the flat , gets antsy , and decides , albeit reluctantly ( she just ca n't help herself ) , to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret . Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons . The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer . This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles , fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking ( they walk everywhere ) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring , uneventful , low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits . Go figure . ( C- )
0 I 'm a fan of Matthew Modine , but this film -- which I stumbled upon on cable -- is absolutely witless . I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same , so there was no one around to check her worst instincts . There are no surprises , no original lines , and no original characters . The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character . What a waste of all this acting talent . Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days , I have to wonder how this got made in the first place . And if you 're wondering why I watched it at all , it came on after a film that I like on cable and I left it on while I worked at the computer . It 's not a very demanding picture !
0 Worst movie ever made ! ! ! Please see the Real movie reviews from the pros on this movie . Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film . The comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film . I find the positive comments very misleading . I find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an Academy Awards Speech . Do n't waste your hard earned money ! ! ! ! ! ! This Film is retarded ! ! I ca n't believe a film like this would ever be made . Why would Hollywood waste their time on such junk ? This film is an attempt at nothing . I ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash . I went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money . I did n't listen and I did waste my time and cash . Please do n't make the same mistake ! It really is the " Worst movie ever made ! "
0 I just saw this film last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them . The film was simply awful - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful . Matthew Modine 's days as a leading man are way over . Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film . Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed . The script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters . I highly doubt this will be picked up , but then again , people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes . I really think " Kettle of Fish " is a serious contender for the worst movie I 've ever seen .
0 This is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron . The acting is second rate . Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film . And god help Gina Gershon . Her accent is too over the top . It sounds nothing like an true English woman . It sounds forced and phony , much like her acting . She should stick to what she does best , lesbian showgirl con - artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem . The other characters are no better . They are two dimensional . empty , vapid and silly . How are we to supposed to care about these people . At one point Christy Scott Cashman get 's lost in Central Park . Really ? It 's not that hard to navigate Central Park . Just follow any path out . Not only did I not care about ANY of the characters , I downright hated them . The only reason I even stayed with this train - wreck of a film was Fisher Stevens . Even his brilliant humor could n't save this dying Fish . Each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us . The script was awful as was the acting . If you catch this Fish throw it back !
0 For the life of me I ca n't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap . It was pointless . Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man . Gina Gershon , well , others have said it , but I 'll reiterate , why the stupid accent ? Totally unnecessary . And her acting was just bad . I do n't know if she was thrown by the accent , or what . There was no chemistry between these two . < br /><br />And the girl Modine was in love with , suddenly she 's shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way ? Where did that come from ? I think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble , but frankly , I could n't care less about any of these people .
0 Let 's face it , romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies ( just look at the Academy Award nominations each year ) . But still , the good ones are truly an art form . Look at " When Harry Met Sally " , " Sleepless In Seattle " , and classics like " Roman Holiday " and " It Happened One Night " . I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness.<br /><br />This movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy . But no one believes the romance between the main characters , and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming . Modine is way past being a leading man - especially a romantic lead . I 'm sure as Executive Producer , he had the means - but not the good sense - to cast himself . And Gershon ... I see possibilities of some comedic talent , but she had no script and a poorly developed character . And whose idea was the English accent ? Pointless.<br /><br />Others have stated it , but I want to repeat : this story is poorly conceived , poorly executed ; the actors are terribly miscast ; and the characters , well , we just do n't give a hoot about them.<br /><br />An art form this ai n't . Go rent " Moonstruck " again .
0 This movie was supposed to have depicted a ' ladie 's man ' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all . However , I did not care for his mission to settle down , because I did n't care for his character . I do n't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him . He had absolutely no class , or charisma . He should 've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing , but to no avail . Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy . Not to mention , the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous . Does this man have any shame what - so - ever ? Had he tidied up , and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character , but alas , his character was bland and boring.<br /><br />Gina Gershon 's character was unnecessarily British . She could 've just as easily been an uptight out - of - towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.<br /><br />The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog . Now those two had chemistry ! Academy nominations for both   STAT ! Plot holes , lack of character development , horrible acting , unnecessary drama , cliché moments ... What a mess of a movie .
0 This was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the original . The Brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over - the - top histrionics of the American version . The original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings . I have watched the series many times and am still enthralled.<br /><br />Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of " Cracker " . Get hooked up with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such delights as Waking the Dead , Spooks , Silent Witness , and Judge John Deed . Watch the original Touching Evil , then look for " Wire in the Blood " for more of the truly understated , elegant performance of Robson Green . Hollywood needs to have a look at this actor !
0 " Rival reporters Pat Morgan ( Ginger Rogers ) and Ted Rand ( Lyle Talbot ) are always trying to out - scoop each other on stories . The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment . The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis.<br /><br />This said - to - be follow - up to " The Thirteenth Guest " has little to do with the earlier movie ; it is not a sequel , as has been inferred . Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills . Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization . They are a pleasant team , the plot is interesting and mysterious ; but , the resulting film is very dull . The opening and closing are startling . A long - winded wrap - up of plot development points follows the climax.<br /><br / > * * * A Shriek in the Night ( 1933 ) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers , Lyle Talbot , Harvey Clark
0 A very young Ginger Rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter Lyle Talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from Poverty Row film maker Allied Productions . The movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house , or was it from a lover 's apartment ? Rogers actually has two identities at the film 's outset , that of Miss Terry , the dead victim 's secretary , along with her newspaper byline of Pat Morgan . Mistakenly phoning her story directly to Ted Rand ( Talbot ) instead of her paper 's rewrite desk , she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he 's been out scooped.<br /><br />Here 's a puzzle - it 's revealed during Police Inspector Russell 's ( Purnell Pratt ) investigation of Harker 's death that Terry / Morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks . Why exactly was that ? After the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story , but before ? Clues are dropped regarding Harker 's association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building , but again , that association is n't relevant until it 's all linked up to janitor Peterson ( Harvey Clark ) . And who 's making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a HSSS , with the words " You will hear it " cut and pasted beneath ? Apparently , the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house 's radiator system , which Peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims , such as Mrs. Coby in the apartment below Harker . But in answer to a question posed to Inspector Russell about Mrs. Coby 's death , he replied " apparently " to the cause of strangulation.<br /><br />It 's these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me . The revelation of janitor Peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of Miss Morgan in the building 's incinerator furnace ! However , and score another point against continuity , we see Miss Morgan in a huge basement room as Peterson ignites the furnace ; she made her getaway , but how ? And still pretty as a picture . And who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant Wilfred ( Arthur Hoyt ) , who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room.<br /><br />Sorry , but for all those reviewers who found " A Shriek in the Night " to be a satisfying whodunit , I feel that any Charlie Chan film of the same era is a veritable " The Usual Suspects " by comparison . If you need a reason to see the film , it would be Ginger Rogers , but be advised , she does n't dance .
0 What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is , in fact , a head - ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters ( the only big actor being Ginger Rogers , in a very early role ) all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building . These characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean . As a cheap , low budget production , most of the action revolves around Rogers and her lead man ( some guy , I do n't care who he is 'cause he really sucked ) talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime , while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt . Honestly , I 've never had a worse time watching an old b - rate movie of this type , and I 've seen some real head - slappers.<br /><br />Oh , and the butler did n't do it , because there was n't a butler . But pay attention to the guy who 's closest to a butler . There ya go.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0 I am appalled at how bad this film is . As a pastiche of early 20th century Hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past The Moderns or ( gasp ) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I 'd see a film worse than those 2 . Granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period . Nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar.<br /><br />First off there 's the horrible casting : Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN ? Excuse me ? Peter , did you owe this guy something ? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ? ? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ? ? ? Holy smoke , these people do n't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting.<br /><br />Well , Last Picture Show was a decent film , but this thing is a disaster & the rest of Bogdonovitch 's pics have n't been much better . Guess rubbing up against Welles & Hitch & Ford wore off a long time ago . Still good for hosting TCM though .
0 After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound - track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty . For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20 's music and the scratchiness of the sound - track . I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the Director.<br /><br />I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film . The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film . These days , directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique . Unfortunately , no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same.<br /><br />So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film ( which you can find out for yourself elsewhere ) the sound - track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss . You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound - track and certainly not a cat 's meow .
0 ... is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire : scandal , sex , celebrity , power . Kirsten Dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies like she thinks she 's in " Legally Blonde . " The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him . Eddie Izzard is pretty good , except that he 's playing Charlie Chaplin , and is about , oh , 125 lbs too heavy for the part ? Hard to believe this hamfisted , uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich , but then again , he has n't made a watchable movie in , what ? 30 years ? Sometimes , there 's just no coming back .
0 Anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz , 1920s dress , the Charleston , and ultra - swanky yachts ( e.g. me , on all counts ) will want to like this movie . But the sad fact is that that 's all there is . The plot is banal and obvious , the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings - on , and when the whole thing 's over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke . This is a beautifully made bad movie .
0 Just because an event really happened does n't mean that it will make a good screenplay/ movie . The Cat 's Meow , by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst . The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit . The key moments of the story seem implausible ; for example , when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer , believing him to be Chaplin . Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived . The story attempts to be a dark comedy , but The Cat 's Meow misses an important piece of this equation , comedy . There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters . It hardly matters who is shot , who is killed , who is guilty and who is innocent . There is not a strong character to cheer for . As a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental .
0 Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress . You can tell always she 's just " acting " . I like Izzard though . Plot is awfully boring . The viewer has no real connections to the characters , never knowing who to really sympathize with , or even care about . Slow , dull movie , with some laughs , but few and not very funny anyway . Plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least . You can see each plot turn coming a mile away . What is this movie supposed to be ? Comedy ? Drama ? Who cares ? You wo n't by the end of this film .
0 What happened to Peter Bogdanovich ? Once a brilliant director , a trail blazer ... is now scraping the very bottom ... Is this the same man who directed " The Last Picture Show " ? Here , he takes a somewhat interesting ( albeit farfetched ) premise , and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad , but Izzard is miscast as Chaplin , and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their " looks " , and not because they were right for the part . Too bad . I 'll go rent " Paper Moon " again .
0 Anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we 're about to see ca n't ever be known and " This is the whisper [ rumor ] most often told " about one of Hollywood 's most sensational " mysteries." < br /><br />Okay . So we 're not getting anything new ( and E ! 's " Mysteries & Scandals " gives you a better foothold on the particular incident ... and that 's not much of an endorsement ) . What do we get?<br /><br />We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper 's and decadents . No big news there . More interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and/or political establishment . It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters . But what 's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled , we 're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history.<br /><br />The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun . We 're not empathetic with anyone . And the great " Citizen Kane " polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way . In " The Cat 's Meow " we 're not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst . As soon as we 're told one thing , she 's off doing the other.<br /><br />And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain 's life ? Or is he just trying to cockold one of America 's most powerful -- and apparently moronic -- citizens . The film never makes it clear.<br /><br />What is convincing are the production values . There 's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes . I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men 's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well - known personalities in Hollywood history . No one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction . The disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The performers ca n't be faulted , although Meg Tilly goes way past parody here . Kirsten Dunst never disappoints . She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing . Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material , but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it . One of her first lines is , " I 'm not here ! " And I 'm sure she wishes she wasn't.<br /><br />This is n't on par with Bogdanovich 's trashy , so - bad - it's - good " At Long Last Love . " It 's perched on attempting something serious , but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it 's so full of bitterness towards " the beast " named Hollywood . This is " National Enquirer " filmmaking . And it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the Oneida that weekend , but the audience gets pretty dirty as well .
0 " The Cat 's Meow " contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue , and some fine performances , a few of which surprised me . Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin ( partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer ) ; Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn ; and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies ( though why movies never use her real - life stutter is difficult to explain ) . But these elements do n't add up to a successful whole . The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes -- the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well crafted -- but not so hard on the big picture . Several minor characters do n't need to be there , and do n't behave consistently . The basic plot is full of illogic ( e.g. , why does Thomas Ince think it 's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does n't want to hear ? ) , and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome . I 'd like to think a trip on Hearst 's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates . Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type , which is n't really accurate , and the screenwriter 's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible . < br /><br />Strangely , Bogdanovich , who seemed so connected to the Thirties in " Paper Moon " , lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties . He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream , which gives the party guests a very artificial look , and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period ( e.g. , " Yes , We Have No Bananas " ) . When Hearst insists everybody " Charleston , Charleston ! " it looks as if the actors had a ten - minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot . < br /><br />The lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies , I 'm sure , but not this time .
0 If your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars ( you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel , being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel -- and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time ) then this is the documentary for you . Admitedly I did n't watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism , but that was enough for me . Maybe the rest is even better.<br /><br />I wonder how long it 's going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies . Perhaps game shows based on self - mutilation might be nice.<br /><br />I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen . I do n't need to see the proof on the TV masquerading as entertainment .
0 Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar ? I mean really , animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards . Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman . Whatever their reasoning , the story truly did suck.<br /><br />Somehow , Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet . Yeah I know , seems stereotypical . But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to an extent . Throw in a promise of jewels ( ? ? ? ? ) and an evil ( ? ? ) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.<br /><br />I would like to say something entertained me . Maybe the hookup in the movie ? Or maybe the happily - ever - after rat relationship . But nothing did . It had the talent , but it blew up . D-
0 Ultimately too silly and pointless . Yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that . Forgettable . Instantly.<br /><br />Animation is , as we have come to expect , super - real . The plot - line could best be described as thin but tenacious . Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me.<br /><br />The sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and , somehow , wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too . Oh yes , and there 's a romantic interest with the female being the smarter , more savvy and go - getting of the pair - this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome ( anti ) stereotype . Probably your kids will love it though .
0 Oh if only I could give this rubbish less than one star ! There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it ! one was where a line or two from the song Do n't Worry , Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin . That is it there was nothing more amusing than that , at least not for me anyway ! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying ' Fans of the completely terrible " Shrek " might enjoy , but " Wallace & Gromit " fans will probably turn away in disgust . ' As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit . You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching , this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get ! The continuity mistakes were too big in number . Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not . I wo n't point out all of the others , but here are a few more to see : When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it . At one point the ruby falls down Roddy 's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards . In the next scene Roddy has caught it again . This is impossible . Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy 's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy 's hand . There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it.<br /><br />Too many , for want of a better word , ' jokes ' were repeated in one way or another , there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters , the characters were hollow , shallow and empty , and the whole film left you wanting .... wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else ! Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options !
0 Let 's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand : This is a very dumb film with an even dumber script , lame animation , and a story that 's about as original as thumbtacks . Do n't bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children . They might laugh , especially if they 're off their meds . There 's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort , but they do n't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing . This film , frankly , ticked me off royally . Shame on you for stooping so low .
0 So do n't even think about renting this from the shops , because this is one hell of a bad movie . You 'd think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie . Basically , a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out . Fans of the completely terrible " Shrek " might enjoy , but " Wallace & Gromit " fans will probably turn away in disgust . Also , why did n't they do it in plasticine or clay ? I mean , CGI animation ? ? For an AARDMAN movie ? ? ! ! Obviously , Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing . Wrong , wrong , WRONG ! ! ! Nearly every single character is awful , apart from that freaky frog guy , who is just right for a movie villain . But everything else about the movie is DULL , DULL , DULL ! ! ! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie . No , wait , actually , I DID fall asleep with boredom watching this movie . It 's just terrible . But thankfully , it 's not as bad as " Shrek . "
0 From the creators of Shrek  .. OK , that grabbed my attention.<br /><br />Well the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar . Madagascar was half as good as Shrek.<br /><br />And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar.<br /><br />That means Flushed Away is n't good . The animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn't.<br /><br />The story of this movie was only meant for kids . It 's seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick.<br /><br />But there were many jokes meant for adults . I bet kids dint understand the jokes.<br /><br />Despite that I dint like this flick.<br /><br />I am completely disappointed . 4/10
0 Do n't understand how these animated movies keep coming out , and no matter how good ( or bad ) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids ( 5,7 ) . They like pretty much anything animated ( like most people who rated this film ) . The theater was almost full , and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast . To tell the truth I was bored silly . It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny . There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it . Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh , but just did n't work . My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie , but not on this one . My daughter fell asleep half way through . Also , the kids thought the character animation looked weird . I have n't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express , which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me , I 'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything . But quality is quality , and like so many animated movies they throw out there , it has very little .
0 OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie . Its about this pampered rat , who lives in a palace . Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet ! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants . He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats . He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city ! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs . They do all the sound effects . They sing , make noises , its awesome , its also pretty funny . OK bottom line , it is aimed at 7 year olds . Other wise , a great movie to take a younger family member to see . I did n't think the animation was real dreamworks art though , more like WAllace and Gromit . i thinkthey slacked a little on that . The movie was just decent , not worth spending $ 9.50 for though , sorry .
0 I wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute " Borat " tonight , and left quite disappointed . I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit , and routinely go to see animated films . That being said , I found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out , but stayed waiting for this film to get better . Never happened.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch , especially in my opinion , that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen ( I had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was Gandalf and Magneto ) . The problem with this movie for me is it 's one of those animated features for the ADD - set . It registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another , weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an " Important Message . " It looks a lot like busted Oscar bait for the animated category , and considering the way it 's scoring with critics , I would n't be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware . But if you 're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats , take my advice and wait for Ratatouille .
0 A few months ago , I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster ( Hey , Kmadden ) about this film . The poster insisted that if I gave ' Flushed Away ' a chance , I would like it . Based partially on that argument , I agreed to watch the film.<br /><br />'Flushed Away ' has good intentions ( At least on Aardman 's part ) , but lacks the strength to pull it all together . Its best asset is sewer rat / boat captain , Rita ( Played by Kate Winselt ) , who , IMO , should have been the movie 's main character instead of Roddy ( Hugh Jackman ) . Rita 's cool , tough , and interesting , while Roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.<br /><br />One of the things that bothered me most about ' FA ' is the repetition of jokes that are n't funny to begin with . When Roddy gets hit in the crouch , the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately . " My name 's Shocky , " says one of Rita 's brothers , who then electrocutes Roddy at least three times . My tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low.<br /><br />I wo n't waste time griping about Katzenberg 's kleptomaniac tendencies toward Pixar ( One similar film 's a coincidence , five 's a rip off . ) , but I will say I 'm disappointed in Aardman . They can do ( and have done ) so much better . Try harder next time , guys .
0 Just got back from a free screening and I 'm very glad I did n't pay to see this very sub - par film . The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults . It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap - stick and fart jokes though ( good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot ! ) . The movie is pretty juvenile , unintelligent , predictable , and mostly annoying . The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.<br /><br />Visually , the film is about average with nothing that really stands out . They did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from Wallace and Gromit , but other than that it 's very forgettable imagery.<br /><br />Although I was really bored throughout the whole film , I chuckled a couple times . It 's not an absolute failure , but I most definitely would not want to watch it again . If you 're a parent with kids ( and you do n't care that your kids see mindless cheap - jokes ) then feel free to take them to see it , but everyone else should n't waste their money .
0 There is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different ... and end up being mediocre . I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball , but the same applies to Steve Martin.<br /><br />This movie is reasonably well acted and directed , but the script is a stinker . Martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in " Roxanne " , but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility . If you want to see an old story updated with some style , best to rent " Great Expectations " .
0 This film is a flagrant rip - off of one of the best novels of all time , Silas Marner by George Eliot.<br /><br />The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film , only a credit at the end of it saying " suggested by the book Silas Marner " . Suggested ? It was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:<br /><br />A wronged and sad old man , an artisan , poor and lonely , has all his money stolen . One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside . The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire ( or rich politician here ) demands to adopt the child . It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before . The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.<br /><br />In this and every other aspect of the film , the story is exactly the same . In only one can I find a difference . Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far . On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction ( presumably to make him look younger , but actually making him look more the clown that he is ) ! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes , that this offbeat comedian can not resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story . Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years . This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!<br /><br />I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made . If I was a trustee of George Eliot 's I would insist on reparation . If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate , or to the poor . At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin . Or better still removed from the archives!<br /><br />If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner . Or read the book ! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980 's .
0 This tear - teaser , written by Steve Martin himself , is so unbelievably bad , it makes you sick to your stomach!<br /><br />The plot is pathetic , the acting awful , and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs !
0 TOM BROWN 'S SCHOOLDAYS < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.78:1<br /><br />Sound format : Stereo < br /><br />In late 19th century England , young Tom Brown ( Alex Pettyfer ) is sent to the public school at Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster ( Stephen Fry ) and stands up to the school 's resident bully , Flashman ( Joseph Beattie).<br /><br />Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably Gordon Parry 's superior 1951 version - Thomas Hughes ' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment , courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah ( TV 's " Where the Heart Is " ) and director David Moore ( THE FORSYTE SAGA ) . It 's pleasant enough , and watchable , but it 's also rather staid and dull , distinguished only by Fry 's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school 's most dubious ' traditions ' , and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old Pettyfer , a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond . Otherwise , this is typical UK TV fodder , the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with ' prestige ' product , even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this . The UK publication ' Radio Times ' described it as " daintily odd " and raised a querulous eyebrow over " all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome , rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys " . Quite .
0 I thought Harvey Keitel , a young , fresh from the Sex Pistols John Lydon , then as a bonus , the music by Ennio Morricone . I expected an old - school , edgy , Italian cop thriller that was made in America . Istead , I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying : WTF ! ! ! Too many unanswered questions , and not enough action . The result : a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet . Keitel and Lydon work well together , so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better script . Oh , and the Morricone score : OK , but not memorable.<br /><br />Overall , not a waste of time , but not a " must see " , unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan .
0 Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film . Bad mistake . I 've seen 950 + films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it 's awful in almost every way : editing , pacing , storyline , ' acting , ' soundtrack ( the film 's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times ) . The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme . Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film . < br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort . One for Keitel obsessives only .
0 I saw this on DVD ( It`s known as CORRUPT in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel`s character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in " This gritty and powerful police thriller " . What the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old Italian movie . How old is it Theo ? Well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the CD player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . You see my point about this being an old film ? The DVD case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . It`s also a film with poor production values like so many other Italian films masquerading as American ones . With the exception of Keitel the cast are awful though Johnny Rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( I don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy DVD or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone`s score . It`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns.<br /><br />All of this is a pity because CORRUPT does have its moments . It`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . Just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards
0 Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be ( a ) intelligent , ( b ) important and ( c ) interesting , fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly . The script makes little sense , the whole idea of the sado - masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite , and John Lydon shows us all , in the space of one movie , why he should never have let himself out of music . His performance is one - note and irritating.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn . His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act , but mercifully his performance here is restrained .
0 On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk . He releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship . They dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star . This massive craft is populated by only three people , presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors . Anyway , to cut a long story short , the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies.<br /><br />The psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying . ' Annoying ' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic - unhinged , frightening , dangerous maybe but not ' annoying ' but he is . The three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city ! Considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future , it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man - made craft could exist , never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task . Despite the vast size of the spaceship , the crew all have appallingly kitted out , tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs . But there are a lot of corridors.<br /><br />The film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci - fi thriller . But nothing great .
0 A pretty average scifi film . The plot was more or less obvious from the start . Although the acting was reasonably good , the writing seemed very cliched , using ideas taken from numerous films.<br /><br />The basic plot : Scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting . Onboard they find a stasis pod , which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment . After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up , you realise that he is a complete lunatic . Something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship ... <br /><br />After that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims , overall I think Speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter , which I did n't consider to be a good film either.<br /><br />Not a good film , get Aliens out and watch that again.<br /><br / >
0 Getting lost in space frozen for 15 years , that 's unlikely . Falling into a star ... improbable . Falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes ... ludicrous . Getting rescued by a ship just then ... priceless.<br /><br />No , it 's not Zaphod Beeblebrox 's Heart of Gold to the rescue . It 's also not the Parent of the Year awardees . After sentencing her daughter to two years ' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship , the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they 've picked up . This foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat , which makes up most of the film 's action . Combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away , who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.<br /><br />In the end , the family of three abandons the metropolis - sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave , instead using the psycho 's fighter ship which they 've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile . You have to love those hard sci - fi statistics ! < br /><br />As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill , they 'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the Sci fi channel .
0 This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy - McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes . It 's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers . In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow ; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.<br /><br />Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices ( with little acting ability ) and there 's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.<br /><br />This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers . With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation .
0 Back in the day , I remembered seeing dumb Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show ... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me ! I was not estatic , but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show was gon na suck . My friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy ( i 'm actually gay ) , so I decided to watch the show with low expectations.<br /><br />WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! First off , I hate the new characters . Tiff and Tuff are so dumb and I hate how so many fanboys drool over Tiff , it 's sad . I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki ( or whatever his nonstraight name was ) a good guy who owned a restaurant . Bad move , 4Kids TV ! Escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the King Dedede ( who sucks big time in this show ) and I hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying Dedede with those awful weapons to destroy Kirby . So stupid , I hate this show.<br /><br />I then began to hate Kirby even more since it was obvious Nintendo was just aching to get Kirby some popularity . Kirby'll never beat Mario in the fight for coolness , and Kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness . NUF SAID ! ! !
0 Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the all - time greatest comedy team , he laboured under contract to Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheapies , many of which were parodies of major Hollywood features . Following a dispute with Anderson , Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rock 's smaller ( and more indigent ) production company.<br /><br />Most of Laurel 's parody films were only mildly funny at the time , and even less funny for modern audiences who have n't seen the original movie which Laurel is parodying . ' West of Hot Dog ' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot-'em - ups . It 's marginally a specific parody of ' West of the Pecos ' , an oater released two years earlier with no major actors . Since ' West of the Pecos ' was never a huge success , it 's difficult to see why Stan 's film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery , much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it . And where did they get that title ' West of Hot Dog ' ? Possibly it 's down to the fact that ' Hot dog ! ' was a sexual interjection favoured by American lechers in the 1920s . ( As in the opening scene of the stage play ' Machinal ' . ) < br /><br />'West of Hot Dog ' was produced and co - directed by Joe Rock . Among his many other achievements , Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson , and he was subsequently best man at their wedding . Full disclosure : In the last years of his life , I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him . Nearly ninety years old at the time , Rock 's memory was impressively clear ... but he remembered nothing at all about ' West of Hot Dog ' , and I ca n't blame him . This movie is eminently forgettable.<br /><br />The leading lady 's character is named Little Mustard : If that 's meant to be a parody of something in ' West of the Pecos ' , I do n't get it . There are a couple of ' impossible ' gags here , including Laurel 's method for mounting a horse . For just one moment in this movie , Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke into a run . ' West of Hot Dog ' is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to Keaton 's short comedy ' The Frozen North ' , but Keaton 's version is much funnier . The plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in Keaton 's feature ' Our Hospitality ' but ( again ) suffers by comparison : here , two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon , but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot Stan . However , the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies . Hmmm ... <br /><br />Seriously , though : is such a bequest legal ? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property , surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision , not the previous owner 's decision . I had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy.<br /><br />At one point , a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock . It looks cheap and is n't funny.<br /><br />This ' Hot Dog ' is no weiner , and no winner : it 's just a whiner . My rating : one point out of 10 . Hang on , Stan : in a few more years you 'll be one - half of a comedy legend .
0 ... however I am not one of them . Caro Diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time , but the boring and self - centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self - indulgent mess . Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie , but does n't want to , whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it , but really does n't want to either . A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating , but this is not that film . At one point , Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters , discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside , but it 's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them . Interposed with Moretti 's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son , and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro ( the film drags us through several years and more than one election period ) . We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument , but they never come . I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again . He succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity .
0 You know when you 're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life - story , and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off ? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film . Okay , I did actually choose to go and see Aprile , and I knew about Nanni Moretti 's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario , but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps . Caro Diario was funny , unusual , and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways . In Aprile , however , Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue , so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high - pitched whine going on about how his politics are best , or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment . He also finds time to slag off films that he does n't like , something I thought was reserved for losers like me . Surely being in a position like his you 'd think he 'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this . By making a proper film perhaps , one with some ideas and a decent structure , or maybe one that is n't completely dominated by his annoying voice . And when he started fawning over his newborn baby , I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal , preferably not a self - obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music . The next time someone you do n't know tries to tell you their life - story , give them a slap from me . Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism .
0 I noticed with some amusement that in the end credits , the Detroit PD is thanked for their participation . The Chief of Police even has one speaking line playing himself ( and boy , can you tell he ca n't act ) . The reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later . Not the kind of PR , I would think a police force would want . Other than that , this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the ' 70 's with a racial angle . Alex Rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that ca n't get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife . He makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse . Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat . The movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense ( why do people that are only guilty of a robbery , take on a whole police force ? ) . Not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys , we get to see four . Then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was . Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the braindead " Friday Foster " and " Bucktown " , I should n't have wondered .
0 Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for $ 2 . I enjoy a good B movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one.<br /><br />The movie is quite cliche " 1970 's " and is quite groovy for that . Unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie . In fact , I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was.<br /><br />The movie has good spots in it , but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them.<br /><br />If you are into B movies , this might just be for you , just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens , and did I mention not much story line either ... <br /><br / >
0 This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film , " Double Indemnity , " is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script . This grade - B TV fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general . While Hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black - and - white films and sought disclaimers on wide - screen movies that are shown in pan - and - scan versions , the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake.<br /><br />The first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script . The Billy - Wilder - Raymond - Chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time - slot with room for commercials . Then update the production with bland , color photography , smart , upscale sets , and TV - familiar actors . Thus , the brand - new " Double Indemnity " eliminates the atmospheric black - and - white film - noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original . Gone are the dusty , shadowy , claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists ' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost . Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis.<br /><br />The look of Jack Smight 's take on " Double Indemnity " is more " Dynasty " than film noir . Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer home to die for , and Neff 's comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman 's salary , not to mention the sporty Mercedes convertible that he drives . Neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry $ 200,000 . If not money , then perhaps murder for love or lust ? Not in this version . Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar , and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister . Crenna fails to capture the cynicism of Neff , and his attempts at double - entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat . Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind . Only Lee J. Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes . Director Jack Smight and his three principals have all done much better work.<br /><br />There was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule . There was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on DVD and package it with the original film except to fill out a double - disc package . The only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting , lackluster direction , and TV grade production values . The 1973 " Double Indemnity " should be titled " 10 % Indemnity , " because viewing it only underscores the 100 % perfection of the original movie .
0 When Samantha Eggar ( as Phyllis Dietrickson ) answers the door of her house swathed in a towel , you realize that as competent an actress as Eggar may be , she does n't have the hypnotic allure of Barbara Stanwyck . And it is not entirely Eggar 's fault . In the original film , Wilder had Stanwyck not only appear in a towel , but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house . And she does n't " come out " ; she appears , almost as if by magic . Walter Neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor . There is a reason for this . Stanwyck is much higher than Neff ( Fred MacMurray ) when they are first introduced . It is not just the towel . The towel adds to the seductive allure . Her pose is like a Greek Goddess overlooking her domain , and , in a strange way , you feel as if , from the start , she is actually controlling the entire situation . She has sexual , even magic , power . This person is no ordinary housewife . This person is a mystery with secrets hidden within.<br /><br />Back to 1973 . The remake has Crenna knock on the front door . Stanwyck 's stand - in , Eggar , answers the door with a towel around her . There is no " appearance " . She simply opens the door . The alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of Stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 . She opens the door with a towel around her . It may be sexy in a Charlie 's Angels sort of way , but it 's not nearly as mysterious . The filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand Wilder 's point . The script may have said " Phyllis appears in towel " so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel . The point is not the towel . The point is the enigmatic quality of Phyllis , and the potential power she wields . Wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique . The filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that 's what Wilder did . And in the choice of shot , lost all of Phyllis ' mystique.<br /><br />Richard Crenna also seems miscast . He seems like he 's " acting " and not really in the midst of the dilemma . Part of the problem is Crenna appears so much like a 70 's actor . He ca n't get into the 1940 's . When MacMurray first speaks into the microphone , sweat begins to drip from his face . No sweat on Crenna . And they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning . In the original , Neff says , " I did n't get the money , and I did n't get the woman . " In the 1973 version , Crenna says , " I did n't get the money , and I did n't want the woman . " Did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story ? Or were they dumbing it down for a " television " audience?<br /><br />This made - for - TV movie is a by - the - numbers rendition . All the sharp edge of the original is lost . The only stand - out , maybe , is Lee J. Cobb in the role made famous by Edward G. Robinson . But he can not save the loss of intensity of the original . This 1973 boring remake is a forgettable TV - movie made probably by the same people who did " Gilligan 's Island " . They might as well have tried to remake " Citizen Kane " or " Gone with the Wind " . If mediocrity is the best one can hope for , what 's the point ? The 1944 classic is a Film with a capital " F " . This made - for - TV remake deserves an " F " grade , or , maybe a " D " for dumb .
0 It was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan the original 1944 movie . That , to me and many others , is one of the greatest film noirs ever made . Realizing this is simply a shortened made - for - TV film and that most people had trashed it , I did n't expect much , but you ca n't help but compare this with the ' 44 film . Scene after scene , I found myself comparing what I was looking at it , and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray , Barbara Stanwyck , Edward G. Robinson and others . Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb.<br /><br />When it was all over , I found it was n't as bad as I had expected but it 's no match for the 1944 original . The two main areas in which this made - for - TV film was n't as good were ( 1 ) the electricity between the two leads was missing and ( 2 ) being only 90 minutes , they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot , characters and chemistry between those leads . Crenna and Eggar were flat , and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as " Walter Neff " and " Phyllis Dietrichson , " respectively.<br /><br />Where this re - make held its own was in the other characters , such as " Barton Keyes " and " Edward Norton . " Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton , head of the insurance company . It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed , so the houses , cars , telephones , dictating machines , etc . , were all early ' 70s instead of mid ' 40s . Otherwise , the storyline was very similar , just rushed.<br /><br />However , one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film .
0 Watch the Original with the same title from 1944 ! This made for TV movie , is just god - awful ! Although it does use ( as far as I can tell ) almost the same dialog , it just does n't work ! Is it the acting , the poor directing ? OK so it 's made for TV , but why watch a bad copy , when you can get your hands on the superb original ? Especially as you 'll be spoiled to the plot and wo n't enjoy the original as much , as if you 've watched it first ! < br /><br />There are a few things that are different from the original ( it 's shorter for once ) , but all are for the worse ! The actors playing the parts here , just do n't fit the bill ! You just do n't believe them and who could top Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original ? If you want , only watch it after you 've seen the original and even then you 'll be very brave , if you watch it through ! It 's almost sacrilege !
0 This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original . Surprise!<br /><br />First , the good things . Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes . He 's not as good as Edward G. Robinson , of course , but he 's the only reason to watch this . This remake 's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson , the step - daughter of the femme fatale , Phyllis Dietrichson.<br /><br />And that 's it for the good things.<br /><br />The bad things are many . The director records everything in an indifferent manner : if you watched the film with the sound muted you 'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening . Because of modern bad taste , the film must be in color instead of black and white . Because of 1970s bad taste , all the sets are distractingly ugly . Walter Neff 's expensive apartment , in particular , is hideous.<br /><br />The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways . Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s , so Mr. Dietrichson 's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance . Men stopped wearing hats , which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white - haired Mr. Dietrichson . Women in mourning stopped wearing veils , which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene . ( Oddly , Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.)<br /><br />Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder - Raymond Chandler script the same . But he makes a lot of tiny , inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular . Outrageously , the famous motorcycle - cop banter is gone , but look closely and you 'll see what looks like a post - production cut where those lines should have been . Bochco may not be to blame.<br /><br />Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff . What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson . Instead we get Samantha Eggar , who comes off like a standard - issue villainess from " Barnaby Jones . " But who can blame Eggar ? With a director who barely seems interested in what 's happening in front of the camera , how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well ?
0 When someone remakes a classic movie , the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original . Also , there 's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.<br /><br />Well , the 1973 TV version of " Double Indemnity " has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original . The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all . Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous , leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original ; Richard Crenna just seems world - weary and tired . Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray 's boss Barton Keys ; Lee J. Cobb , a fine actor , appears almost bored with the proceedings . Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving , back - stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson ; while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role , Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.<br /><br />Robert Webber , in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson 's boss Norton , and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness , bring some life to the movie . In particular , Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context.<br /><br />However , after the movie starts , the whole thing just sort of lies there , without any life or electricity . This is one film that never should have been remade .
0 Utter dreck . I got to the 16 minute/27 second point , and gave up . I 'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible ( although ' pissible ' is a more fitting word ... ) . Unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original , the chemistry between dumb ol' Dicky Crenna and whats - her - face here is just non - existent . The anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet ? There 's no ciggy - lighting - by - fingertip ? And I thought I 'd be SICK when they have a mortified - looking ( and rightly so , believe you me ) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes practically burping / upchucking his way through the explanation of his " Little Man " to Mr. Garloupis . No offence to the non - sighted , but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the Dietrichson and Neff houses . The same goes for those horrid plaid pants that Phyllis wears . And crikey , how much $ $ does Neff make , that he lives overlooking a huge marina ? This , folks , again , all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes . If you can get through more of it , you have a much stronger constitution than me , or you are a masochist . But please , take some Alka - Seltzer first , or you WILL develop a " little man " of your own that may never go away . Proceed with caution , obviously .
0 As a big fan of the original film , it 's hard to watch this show . The garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake . The mood is never there . Instead , it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the Seventies . Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff , but his snappy wardrobe and " swank " apartment do n't fit the mood of the original , or make him an interesting character . He does his best to make it work but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice . The English accent and California looks ca n't hold a candle to Barbara Stanwick 's velvet voice and sex appeal . Lee J.Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes , but even his performance is just gruff , without style.<br /><br />It feels like the TV movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is .
0 Murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to " the end of the line" ... <br /><br />TV was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated , made - for - TV knock - off hurt my eyes . It ca n't possibly compare to the 1944 Billy Wilder Film Noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know -sight unseen- but that does n't mean this update should be seen as a separate entity , either . Although based on the original Paramount screenplay , there 's over half an hour cut out and the director 's bland indifference makes what 's left imminently forgettable . With rare exception , the younger generation was n't interested in watching old black and white movies on TV back in 1973 ( still true today , alas ) so this lurid , compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers ; then as now , ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre . Gus Van Zandt remade Alfred Hitchcock 's PSYCHO for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels , so much the better . I loved the James M. Cain source novel enough to tune in back then and I enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair , halter tops , turbans , ugly decor , and lush auburn locks of " guest star " Samantha Eggar , who did n't try too hard . In addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube , Lee J. Cobb was able to hold my interest as a world - weary , tired - looking Keyes but Richard Crenna 's affable and inoffensive Walter Neff only reminded me of Bill Bixby on a bad day . Improvement upon the original was , of course , never intended in a rush to make a buck but , instead of a mindless retread , a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea . Cain 's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer . The completist in me is thankful this speeded up " Me Decade " update was included as part of the DOUBLE INDEMNITY DVD extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original , it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better - made COLUMBO TV series . I also flashed back to a very good 1973 ABC TV Movie Of The Week that I have n't seen since its initial airing : John D. Macdonald 's LINDA starring the beautiful Stella Stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover 's ( sexy John Saxon ) wife and then frames her mild - mannered husband for the crime and , if I remember correctly , there 's also an open - ended ending . Like DOUBLE INDEMNITY , it was needlessly remade with TV movie queen Virginia Madsen as the titular vixen and Richard Thomas as the milquetoast husband .
0 This could have been a good episode but I simply had to turn it off . The British representation was horrible to watch . Have the makers ever set foot in Britain prior to filming ? At least set foot in England ? ? I do n't think any British person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of The Royal Family ! Also with the 2 English boys ... well I do n't think any English boy has acted , spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry 's preteen public appearances . To American film makers .. There is more than 1 country in the UK . England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland .. meaning more than 1 culture ! I can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad I could not watch it . Fire looked cool though !
0 I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it . The fat guy is the best character , as he seems to be a nice guy . The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men . I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year 's attitudes and fads . Phat Beach is also funny because the low - budget babes in this movie are strictly home - girls . Most low - budget movies have that " local babe " quality , and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys . Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the " youngsters " went wild over what was essentially some really over - used , high - mileage skank . There were some cuties too . That is the charm of these low - budget crappy movies . You will see a lot of doggies , and some real cuties ! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit . Too bad . It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a " Where are they now " book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return . What happened ? ? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder " what ever happened to X ? " Anyhow , this movie mostly blows , but it has some funny moments .
0 Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life . If nothing catastrophic happens before I die , this will be the biggest regret of my life . Who ever even thought about this movie , or financed deserves a kick between the legs , because that 's where they were thinking when they made this movie . It 's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic , and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry . He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast . Where they meet girls and such . Only the fat guy does n't get a girl . Skin flicks do n't annoy me , I take 'em for face value . But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick . It 's about Fat guy looking for love in some girl , but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry . He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies , only he has his lady anyways . The dialogue is super - horrible for even a C movie . It supports a ton of black stereotypes , no character development , it 's a glorified porno movie , without any porn in it . Never ever watch this movie .
0 Is nothing else on TV ? Are you really bored ? Well , then watch Phat Beach . However , do n't rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it . That would be a big mistake.<br /><br />I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points . I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard . However , there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at . If you are looking for an extremely funny " hood " movie then watch Friday . If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie ( something that this movie tries at .. kind of ) watch something like hoop dreams or Jason 's Lyric . If you are lookin for some good black " booty " go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick , because the nudity in this movie is nearly non - existent . However , if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable , go ahead and watch it . You will be slightly amused.<br /><br />***3 out of 10 * * *
0 This is the worst movie ever made . The acting , the script , the location , everything ! I would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie , but even they were bad . You would think that a movie with the word " beach " in it 's title would have good - looking women in it . Would n't you ?
0 A mediocre Sci - Fi Channel original picture . A little squirmish , but not much . The nuclear powered submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels . A member of the crew ( Simmone Jade Mackinnon)thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters , but is not given much chance for vague reasons . Also among the crew are : David Keith , Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen . This movie could have been somewhat better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish .
0 Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie : a whole cast of commercial - quality actors , a poorly designed creature to be the " bad guy , " and a script that is more full of technical , political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.<br /><br />I checked out the movie because of the creature ( I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos ) , and right off the bat , I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie . The actors I expected because of the type of film it is ( really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point ) . The music was typical , not - thought - out action symphonic music.<br /><br />I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment , along with the mini - sub design . The movie even flowed really well , with guiding screens letting you know which set you 're watching the story unfold in . But there is n't much of a story here anyways.<br /><br />This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO . The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it ... kinda lame . Even lamer is the tagged - on love relationship between two of the characters that you do n't see coming . Chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors ' careers off the bench and into a video . Do n't bother .
0 This has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century . It is all the way low quality , but at the end it falls below ... everything . All the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.<br /><br />All the actors are below average , especially the main character Anne Fletcher ( Simmone Mackinnon ) . There is a scene , where Anne is asked : " Why you seem so careless ? " The correct answer is , because she ca n't act . No matter what happens ( the world is about to be destroyed , her friend is dying , she is fired ) , she has the same stupid grin in her face.<br /><br />It is not only the movie , which is B -quality . It is also the back cover description ( at least in Finland ) . The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel , Capital -vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna ( not Anne ) Fletcher . The description sounds like a different movie , both featuring character called Fletcher and sea monsters
0 I do n't get this . The movie obviously has a pretty good budget . It has very good cinematography . It has nice pacing , good editing and pretty good directing too . Then WHY OH WHY did n't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY did they hire such lousy actors that ca n't act their way out of a paper bag ? This movie could have been good . At most times it LOOKS good and FEELS good but in the end , you realize that the movie was no good at all.<br /><br />So I would say it 's a good production but a bad movie . Too bad actually.<br /><br />And eels ? Come one , really !
0 Deep SH .. is more like it ! The eels are just cartooned in over the film . Think " The Incredible Mr. Limpet " meets " Leviathan " . Very tacky.<br /><br />No character or relationship development . So called " romantic " scenes very corny and predictable . An interesting idea , but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make this a definite must - miss !
0 Actually had to stop it . Do n't get me wrong , love bad monster movies . But this one was way too boring , regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere . The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts , was way too obvious a cliché . This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting . From the cover one expects a giant monster , but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels . Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but that 's another review . Deep Shock was really crap , a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget .
0 This was one of the worst movies EVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It was so bad , I was laughing through the WHOLE movie ! The plot was SO cheesy ; especially the end . This movie turns from an end - of - the - world - disaster to save - the - eels ! I mean , c'mon ! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels ! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced . How predictable ! It was SO terrible that my mom , my sister , and I could n't finish it , and when we DID finish it , it was about a year later ! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time , we did MST3K - like comments throughout the movie.<br /><br />Summary : Only watch this if you 're a movie basher ! Make hilarious comments , watch this at a sleepover for laughs , and I mean HUGE laughs . Also watch for mockery . The metaphor that explains this movie : This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets !
0 HORRID!!<br /><br />The special effects make the TV version of " Tremors " look real!<br /><br />No one in the cast can act.<br /><br />Kind of like the ' 62 " Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea " meets the cartoon ocean going electric eel cartoons .
0 The show had great episodes , this is not one of them . It 's not a terrible episode , it 's just hard to follow up " The man that was death . " , " All through the house " , and " Dig that cat , he 's real gone." < br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy ( Ammanda Plummer ) and Charles ( Stephen Shellen ) . In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money . The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion . Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy 's family ... <br /><br />In my opinion you should watch this episode , but just do n't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season .
0 Slim Slam Slum is a sad and disappointing picture . There is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture . Don`t go there , what ever you do , don`t . Watch TV - Shop for 10 hours straight instead . That way you will be slightly amused .
0 I have never seen a movie as bad as this . It is meant to be a " fun " movie , but the only joke is at the start , and it is NOT funny . If you like this sort of movie , then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 . If it had the necessary votes , it would truly belong on the bottom 100.<br /><br / >
0 What a crappy movie ! The worst of the worst ! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug . No - talent - what - so - ever - actors , stupid plot . Who wrote this script ? ! Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record - button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along ? Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what ? My friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur - movie for their school - project which outdid this geeky movie .. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life ! There is just no excuse for this flick !
0 The danish movie " Slim Slam Slum " surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date . I did n't think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b - movies but this one deserves the gold . It 's not funny . It 's bad acting , It 's bad filmed and the storyline is bad . The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it . I truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie " Stjerner uden hjerner " as the badest danish film ever made ! And that 's truly something . Congratulations in advance !
0 The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of . The Godfather Part II shows that young man 's acceptance of his new role , his desensitization of character , as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime . The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.<br /><br />Then , along came The Godfather Part III . Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family . He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors , but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others . Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone . Michael 's plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies . Michael 's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in : protecting his family.<br /><br />The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows : having his own brother killed . Before Part III was made , the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man 's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him : family loyalty . Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance . This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.<br /><br />The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made . The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael 's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed .
0 Near the beginning of " The Godfather : Part III , " Michael Corleone 's son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician . Michael Corleone does not want this . But his estranged ex - wife , Kay , manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes . So he does.<br /><br />That seems like an odd way to start a review , as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action . Just bear with me here ; you 'll see where I 'm going with this eventually . Now let me tell you about the major plot . It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good ( he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business ) . But then along comes Vincent Mancini , an illegitimate nephew , who is involved in a feud . So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff . Meanwhile , Vincent has a semi - incestuous affair with Michael 's daughter Mary . Oh , and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II.<br /><br />It is like a soap opera . One horrid , awful , 169-minute soap opera . Gone is any sort of the sophistication , romance , and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard . After a 16-year break in the franchise , Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films , once again proving his last great work was " Apocalypse Now " back in the 1970's.<br /><br />What 's worse , " The Godfather : Part III " is n't even a logical follow - up of " The Godfather : Part II . " Michael is a completely different person . He has n't just gone to seed ( which might be legitimate , even if it 'd be no fun to watch ) . He 's become a goody - goody that 's trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece . His confession to the priest was bad enough , but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating . He also gets back together with Kay ! For heaven 's sakes , there is absolutely no way that should happen , as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear ! She aborted his baby , and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it . Did n't Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things?<br /><br />And do n't even get me started on Mary and Vincent 's affair ! For a romance so forbidden , it was shockingly unengaging . Sofia Coppola 's acting did nothing to help . She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it , because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee . Every line she delivered was painfully memorized , and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities , all she elicited was inappropriate giggles . In the climactic scene -- I wo n't go into detail , but you 'll know which scene I 'm talking about when / if you watch it -- she looks at Michael and says , " ...... Daddy ? " I think I was meant to cry , but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long , loud laughter!<br /><br />Now we get to the climax , and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone 's musical ambitions . After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances , Anthony Corleone returns ... with an opera ! So Michael , Kay , Mary , and Vincent go to see it , and for about 10 - 15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael . About this climactic sequence , I must say one thing : It was really good ! But not because of the killers -- they were pretty boring . I just really liked the opera . It had some great music and real great set pieces . And , from what little it showed us , it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family 's origin . I 'll bet it was one swell opera , and I 'll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music.<br /><br />My biggest wish is this : that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone 's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama . Better yet , I wish he had n't made " The Godfather : Part III " at all . Part II gave us the perfect ending . This spin off was self - indulgent and unnecessary.<br /><br />P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film . I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago ( though I was rewatching the first one ) . Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III were n't screwed ( in fact , I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard ) , but it also means I 've had a good time to think about all three films . While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first , the more I thought about it , the better it seemed . But with Part III , it was bad to begin with , then got worse the more I thought about it . The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I , but if they watch Part II as well , they will most likely go on to Part III . If you have the will , watch Parts I & II and pretend like Part III never existed .
0 I dislike this movie a lot . If you 've read the Puzo 's books , or at least have watched very closely the two first movies ( specially the first one ) , you 're going to agree with me.<br /><br />Compared with the Corleone 's saga presented by Puzo 's novel , the script of this film is , sometimes , even ridiculous . The characters and the relationships among them are distorted . The story ends up reaching nowhere , although it appears to go to some direction during the movie.<br /><br />It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone 's saga in the 90 's , and that we would not gon na find things the way they were before . But , in the other hand , I do n't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies , in contexts when they did n't fit . Why this ? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film 's qualities.<br /><br />What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo , Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this . A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies . So does Al Pacino , for being the actor he is . But Mario Puzo should n't have written this . How come ? He damaged all his previous work . What a shame , my friend . The Puzo 's novel " The Last Don " is a 90 's story about the mob , and it is great . We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III .
0 And , finally , old , old Michael Corleone falls over and goes ' THUMP ! ' Who REALLY did the writing for this last installment of the Godfather saga ? Probably the same staff who does " As the World Turns . " This flick does n't deserve the title " Godfather " at all . Let 's call this one " The Cosas of Our Nostras " or " All My Capos " . As someone who 's encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life , I can say without exception , that I 've never met any mobster as inwardly - conflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone . Let 's face it , these guys are in the Mafia solely because they 're greedy , nothing more . In this film , Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future , perhaps even the Afterlife , then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is , deep down . Then , there 's his failed marriage . After the break - up scenes in G2 , we may hope that Michael & Kay will reunite as man and wife , but here they seem to just become very good , platonic friends who can laugh & cry & share intimate thoughts about their lives . It 's as if the screenwriters try to make Michael into a woman . It 's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years . There 's some miscasting here and there , or perhaps they 're sins of authorship . Poor , old - country - beautiful Sophia Coppola is saddled with a hopeless role , with too many short lines in the film that do n't fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations - was given " remarks " rather than " lines " to emote . Her ' passionate ' lovemaking scene with Andy Garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open - mouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes ... scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by Glenn Close and Michael Douglas , but it 's just laughable here . Then , there 's Andy 's character , Vinnie Mancini , who 's also given a difficult & thankless role to play . He 's expected , I guess , to be the new , new Don Corleone , but he 's almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position , unlike Michael 's simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1 . This hand - me - down process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a Mafia Family , but why is so much made of this boring routine ? Certainly , Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday , but there 's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man , sadly . Puzo did such a fine job of quickly & concisely developing Michael 's character in G1 . But , G3 has no economy in it 's story - telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze . Thirdly , George Hamilton was also handed a thankless task , in taking over as family lawyer after Robt Duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as Tom Hagen . George wisely underplayed his role , so it came off without damage to the actor . The development of Connie Corleone 's character is interesting , but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands ( she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos , if this were the real world ) . But , it 's not all bad . The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty ! Also , " they keep pulling me back in " or words to that effect is a great line . And , we recover some old - country feel as we get to go back to Sicily , even if it 's all done in 1989 and they 've got modern cars & haircuts . The plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the Catholic Church are pretty interesting , since it 's based on some actual financial shenanigans at Banco Vaticani in the 1980 's , but it 's brought too far , again , with the too - spectacular death scenes , etc . The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed . But , the death scene of Mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional - manipulation , at best . All screenwriters need to learn that we do n't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion . You feel sorry for Kay that her daughter is dead , she plays her grief so well , but Michael 's reaction is hammy , hammy , hammy . Then , Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century , in Sicily , alone on a grand estate , of heart - failure ... no grandson to play with before his demise , no wife to grieve for him . What SHOULD have happened in the last 1/2 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani , put on trial , all his dirty family 's sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day , Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life ... then he can keel over dead from heart - failure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH . That 's how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80 's and early 90 's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved .
0 Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me , the atmosphere of the movie was first class , the acting memorable and the storyline a classic . Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2 ...... I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie , again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG ! , I wish I 'd stopped at II . The storyline was not good , it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story , the characters were weak especially the daughter . Pacino 's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2 . Then scenes such as , Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir , the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset , the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting ( where the ' goodies ' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board , the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes ( a man of his intelligence and guile is n't ready for an emergency ? ) ... NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wo nt be able to watch it again . But I 'll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years .
0 Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past . If such a film is shown to people again , it would surely click provided if it has something new , fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audiences . This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film 's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend . She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting . Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format . Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser . If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders ' film , it may well be Kroko 's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment . It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows .
0 First of all this movie is not a comedy ; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh . Secondly , the movie is slow and boring . The acting is not bad but not special . There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families ( one with big noses and one with big ears ) fighting each other in a small town ... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie . Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule . There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers '' ; this had some good moments . My final comment is : do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film .
0 ' Baptists at Our Barbecue ' is the best film ever made . Now , that I got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken , let me begin my short overview of this tacky , offensive , pretentious and boring hunk of junk I guess you could consider a movie . First of all , the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of Christian Vuissa , and the tacky , overly preachy , whiny and stilted screenplay by F. Mathew Smith . I really despise the fact that it sends a very pro - Mormon , and sort of anti - every other religion message . Yes , the story is about a small town half full with Mormons and half full with Baptists . It shows all the main and role - model characters being Mormon , and being so nice and perfect , yet they are being picked on by the evil , conniving and very judgmental Baptists . It shows how beautiful Mormons are and how cold - hearted and ignorant Baptists are , instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic . I 'm a part of neither religion ( I 'm actually an atheist ) , but this offended me , along with another countless amount of Baptists most likely . It shows the Baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the Mormons , and the Mormons being very accepting , when again , in reality there is a mutual like / dislike between them . Sorry , I did n't mean to go off on a rant.<br /><br />Another aspect of ' Baptists at Our Barbecue ' I did n't much care for , was the acting . The performances are very amateurish and unnatural , especially from the female lead Heather Beers . Miss Beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role , and I was n't too much impressed with Dan Merkley , who 's the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture , but I have to say he 's way more talented or shows more talent in this film then Heather Beers . Whoever played the town sheriff was awful also . Although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film , it is full of clichés . For example , the main character , Tartan ( Merkley ) , finds solace with a Native American who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life - how cliché is that ? To make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché , Tartan buys the poor , lonely heathen a puppy dog . Ugghhh ! < br /><br />If you want my advice , stay as far away from ' Baptists at Our Barbecue ' as you can . I saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion . All I got was a , well , piece of crap . Grade : D-<br /><br />my ratings guide - A+ ( absolutley flawless ) ; A ( a masterpiece , near - perfect ) ; A- ( excellent ) ; B+ ( great ) ; B ( very good ) ; B- ( good ) ; C+ ( a mixed bag ) ; C ( average ) ; C- ( disappointing ) ; D+ ( bad ) ; D ( very bad ) ; D- ( absolutley horrendous ) ; F ( not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces ) .
0 Generally , I 've found that if you do n't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on DVD , there 's probably a good reason for it . I had n't heard about this movie at all until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf . Since all the good movies had already been rented out ( the ones I wanted to see , anyway ) , I figured I 'd give this one a shot.<br /><br />It 's really not much different than other movies in the genre , such as The Singles Ward or the R.M. If you 're into those type movies , you 'll probably enjoy this.<br /><br />However , if you 're not a mormon , this movie probably wo n't appeal to you . There 's no way to avoid the overtly religious ( mormon ) message contained within , and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy . Ultimately , if you do n't fall within the mormon demographic , you 're probably better off watching something else.<br /><br />Admittedly , there were some very funny moments in the film , but I did n't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall .
0 I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie . Very poor acting , offhand production values , utterly pedestrian direction , and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written , let alone produced . Even Hollywood " professionals " apparently go to work just for a paycheck , although no one should have been paid for this bad work . Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel.<br /><br />OTH , there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw - droppingly bad . And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad .
0 I saw this movie in the middle of the night , when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch . It 's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment ! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just ca n't turn it off , no matter how bad it is . One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it 's good and so bad it 's , well , just plain BAD , it 's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it 's both ! Great middle - of - the - night fare , if only for the fabulous tennis drag . Do n't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male , because logic does not apply .
0 I really wish that when making a comedy , the people actually tried to make it funny . This is a film that you can sit through , but nothing is special about it . After watching it , you will say that it was alright . It was not boring to watch , but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at . Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k . story . This movie wanted to be " Tootsie " , but instead it failed.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 out of 10 .
0 This movie was on the Romance channel , and I thought it might be a goofy 80 's movie that would be enjoyable on some level , so my brother and I watched it . Boy did it suck . Boy gets crush on girl -- correction , his * dream*-girl ( apparently there is a difference ; and I 'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl -- he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away . I guess that just goes to show the power of dream - girls ) , boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream - girl ( creative in the sense that it 's a far - out plan , but un - creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up ) , awkward situations ensue , a match is made ( all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon -- either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting , or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day - jobs to come to the set ; I suspect the latter ) . Very clumsily done , very pathetic . It 's almost never even amusing * accidentally * , so there really is nothing to redeem it . Unless you 're interested in seeing Chad Lowe 's early days , before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the HIV - positive gay guy on the series " Life Goes On " , or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably got to stare at Dennis Franz 's buttocks ) . But those are unlikely motives -- I'd say " systematic derangement of the senses " would be a more justified purpose . I 'm surprised I watched it all . I guess it 's the kind of thing where , halfway through , you find yourself * still * watching due to some morbid , self - flagellistic inner - issue , and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie , on the off - chance that it 'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health . Can * You * Take the Challenge ?
0 Quite the most boring nonsense I have seen in a long time . The plot was full of irrelevance , and the acting was the worst I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />To make it worse , camera angles that made me feel sick were used , the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue ( maybe not a bad thing then ) , and the shots of San Francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board 's promotional video.<br /><br />Oh , and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done . Better lighting next time , please .
0 Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who 's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands . The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that 'll return his lost memories if it works . But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon , he chooses to escape instead . While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather ( Greg Grunberg ) mistreats his mother , wo n't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general.<br /><br />While the general ' mystery ' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it 's revealed , I found Mr. Diamond 's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout . ( In the interest of full disclosure , I 've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief , but extremely pivotal , role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse ) Not a great film nor a good one , but serviceable enough . Although I did like it better than the previous films that I 've seen from Director / writer Michael Hurst ( Room 6 , Pumkinhead 4 , Mansquito)<br /><br />Eye Candy : one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination < br /><br />My Grade : C-
0 The story idea is excellent . Unfortunately , the execution lets it down.<br /><br />The movie lacks pace , for one thing . It should be an exciting ride , but it is slow and more than a little boring.<br /><br />I think the problem 's mainly in the screenplay and editing . There are n't enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense , and there are scenes which do n't really move the story along very effectively.<br /><br />The producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite . Unfortunately , when the producer is also the writer and the director , this evidently ai n't gon na happen.<br /><br />Much of the acting seems kind of flat , and that is down to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects.<br /><br />It 's a shame , because with better writing , editing and direction , this could have been a really good thriller .
0 That might be a bit harsh for me saying that , but sadly so far in his directing career its true . Just have a look at what he as done so far . They barely make it past the 3 star mark.<br /><br />Why did I watch this movie ? 2 reasons . Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg . Lucy was outstanding in this movie , her performance carries the whole movie . I do hope she gets a " blockbuster " and breaks into the bigger league of actors , she clearly has the skills . Greg was not so impressive , typical TV acting style.<br /><br />The movie is oddly categorized as a horror . The only " horror " is short flashbacks , and they last a max of 2 - 5 seconds with a little blood in them . I personally would call this more a " drama / thriller".<br /><br />But no matter how interesting the story actually is , bad directing , editing and acting ( appart from Lucy ) destroys it . You get no real connection to the actors , something which is very important in a story like this one . You just sit there watching feeling nothing . Its like watching a bad TV soap .... actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting.<br /><br />My advice : Stay away from this movie ... or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with .
0 This was such a waste of time . Danger : If you watch it you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and heave it thru the window.<br /><br />An amateur production : terrible , repetitive , vacuous dialog ; paper - thin plot line ; wooden performances ; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hackneyed.<br /><br />Seriously flawed story , completely unbelievable characters . The two worst concepts in film and t.v . are : ( 1 ) the evil twin , ( 2 ) amnesia . There are no twins.<br /><br />The plot " twist " ? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies . It does n't even resolve properly . The evil is not punished for the original crime.<br /><br />Please , please , please - do n't watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue .
0 I read a couple of good reviews on this board for " Mr. Scarface " , but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself , the picture will probably make very little sense . Indeed , after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam , the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick 's ( Al Cliver ) character . The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli ( Vittorio Caprioli ) , but as most other viewers commented , he 's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence . I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari 's goons who chased Tony through the streets did n't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them . For all of his buildup as the title character , Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale , making the U.S. working title , " Mr. Scarface " , rather moot . I 've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they do n't all work ; I guess in this case , my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick did n't quite make it either .
0 - A small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money . Of course the mob boss wants his money back and does n't care who he has to kill to get it . The punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life.<br /><br />- If this sounds ridiculous , it is . The whole idea that this Izod - wearing , dune buggy - driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is just plain silly . His friend may be good with a gun , but he 's up against a group of trained killers . The old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob . There 's also a sub - plot about how the friend 's father was killed years ago by the mob boss , but there 's little made of it and it does n't help the movie any at all.<br /><br />- The mob boss , Mister Scarface , is played by Jack Palance . I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek . Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast , doing what he must to get a paycheck.<br /><br />- I 've seen some pretty good Italian crime / cop flicks recently , but Mister Scarface is n't one of them . Check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead .
0 I am a big fan of Ludlum 's work , and of the Covert - one books , and I had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film . Imagine my excitement , then , on learning that such a movie actually existed ! The ' Hades Factor ' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start.<br /><br />From the outset the film was disappointing . Simple elements from the film such as Griffin 's first meeting with Smith are needlessly different from the book , and much less exhilarating . Several characters are poorly cast , too . For starters Dorff is woeful as Smith . Not a bad actor , just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft , and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of John Smith.<br /><br />Re - naming , re - assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film . For example the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back - story of the virus , including the involvement of VAXHAM makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy . Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book , and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat ( not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book ) is another big mistake.<br /><br />Rachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book . Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Amsden ( should be called Sophia Russel ) but she is also supposed to work from the CIA , NOT " Covert - one " . Which brings me to my final point , and I think one of the most important . COVERT - ONE does n't even exist at this point ! Not until the second book of the series is Covert - One devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism.<br /><br />To be honest I could go on all day . In short - if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation , I 'm afraid you 'll be bitterly disappointed . Even as an action movie it is thoroughly average , mainly due to very lack - luster editing and poor effects . The bumbled story line and dull - as - ditch - water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film .
0 If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series , he would have cried . This was complete waste of time and money . I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be , CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum 's work.<br /><br />May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.<br /><br />Poor Mira , Blair , Anjelica and Colm , why did they sign to stoop this low?<br /><br />Horrible ! !
0 Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this ! The plot holds much potential for suspense . John Garfield is as almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against type . Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable.<br /><br />Yes it starts to sag fairly early . There are too many coincidences . And an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more , in the end , than a love story.<br /><br />It 's fun to watch for Garfield , Massey , and the character performers . But it 's not awfully good .
0 A somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about World War Two dangers . The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone ( Nancy Coleman ) has amnesia . The best acting is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll , a good doctor turned evil . He is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac Jane , coded information related to allied activities . Will she tell ? Can she remember ? Moroni Olson ( as Mr. Goodwin ) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey . The role played by John Garfield ( as Dr. Lewis ) is nothing short of disastrous . He seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history . It is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents . The movie is worth one look , despite being a half spy and half gangster film , and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters . It 's easy to forget this one , amnesia is not necessary .
0 I should have figured that any movie with the Poltergeist lady in it is n't going to be good . It actually starts out okay , but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you 're watching is a movie inside of a movie . There 's people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie . One girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned around and strangled her . A bit strange , but far from good .
0 The dialogue was pretty dreadful . The plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents . Not visually stunning . Actually visually annoying at times . Most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button . If you could watch it for free , have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady ... well maybe I 'd recommend it to you , but not anyone else I could think of at the moment .
0 John Pressman ( Micheal ' I shoulda called Ditech ' Lerner ) works at a doctor 's office as an orderly . His mother ( Zelda ' Poltergeist ' Rubenstein ) hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him . But this turns out to be a movie within a movie , but the lines soon blur as John goes a movie theater to kill . Prompting a guy who 's watching the movie to do the same . Lerner is suitably over the top in this , but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again . That gets annoying fast . But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie . As a horror film this one fails , it 's too busy trying to be clever , trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension , or at least a jump or two . No , what we have here is the worst kind of slasher : An art - house one.<br /><br />My Grade : D+
0 The acronymic " F.P.1 " stands for " Floating Platform # 1 " . The film portends the building of an " F.P.1 " in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean , to be used as an " air station " for transatlantic plane flights . Based a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel ; it was filmed in German as " F.P.1 antwortet nicht " ( 1932 ) , in French as " I.F.1 ne répond plus " ( 1933 ) , and in English as " F.P.1 " ( 1933 ) . Soon , technology made non - stop oceanic travel much more preferable.<br /><br />Stars Conrad Veidt ( as Ellissen ) , Jill Esmond ( as Droste ) , and Leslie Fenton ( as Claire ) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic platform . Karl Hartl directed . Mr. Veidt is most fun to watch ; but , he is not convincing in the " love triangle " with Ms. Esmond and Mr. Fenton . The younger co - stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak , respectively . Both the concept and film have not aged well . < br /><br / > * * * * F.P.1 ( 4/3/33 ) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt , Jill Esmond , Leslie Fenton
0 I had a video of the thing . And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep . It 's slow - moving , and the idea of a mid - Atlantic platform , which may have been revolutionary at the time , is now just a great big yawnaroony . Apart from Conrad Veidt , the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable , and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting . When the water started to spill big - time it even , on one occasion , woke me up.<br /><br />But give the man his due . No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt . He does n't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals . He holds it in his fingers , while showing us the old pearly - browns . There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background , and looks very artistically done . But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke .
0 The problems with Nikhil Advani 's Salaam - e - Ishq are many . A one - line concept that looks good on paper ( which also worked in an earlier English film - Love Actually ) goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing . A well - intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition . A director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film ( Kal Ho Na Ho ) - try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick . The problem is - what worked fabulously in Kal Ho Na Ho were the emotional excesses of the Karan Johar school of film - making , but here , ' emotion ' does n't quite grace us with its appearance on the screen - no , not even cursorily . The writer/ director gives us ' six relationships with one common problem - love ' , but where is the intensity , where is the depth , where is the ' emotion ' ? A ' tribute to love ' sans emotion ? And one that goes on and on and on ...... Nah , it just can not work ! < br /><br />In my opinion , the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be ' complete ' , it should - in some way or the other - follow the graph of the traditional three - act structure ( screen writing guru , Syd Field 's Paradigm ) . That 's the real reason why Salaam - e - Ishq did n't work for me . None of the stories had any depth or a roller - coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream Hindi cinema . Also , the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced . It 's not clear what Salman Khan is doing at Ayesha Takia 's wedding . If he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrap - up , why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding ? That would be neater.<br /><br />But yes , some of the stories did have a lot of promise . For one , the Anil Kapoor - Juhee Chawla story tries to address a very real situation - mid - life crisis , but its journey is so linear that you 're left wondering if it was really an issue . Similarly , the problem of commitment in the Akshaye Khanna - Ayesha Takia story is also true to life . If only it was developed a little better . I felt that the more promising stories in this mish - mash were told from the male point of view , which is fine , but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters - Juhee Chawla and Ayesh Takia in particular - have all the depth of a half - filled bath tub . Was n't this film supposed to be about ' 12 different lives ' ? Now the actors . John Abraham still needs to learn acting , while Vidya Balan is dependable and endearing as ever . Anil Kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character . Since she did n't get a meaty character to portray , Juhee Chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it . Akshaye Khanna is fine despite going a trifle over - the - top in a few scenes . Ayesha Takia has nothing much to do , but she does remind us that she 's the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in Dor . Govinda tries to make up for that HUGE mistake called Bhagam Bhag , and succeeds to a large extent.<br /><br />That brings me the most irritating track of the film ( which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time ) - Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra . The track is irritating mainly because of them . But I must credit them for their consistency . They 're consistently BAD all through the film . Priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming - I do n't buy the crap that her role ( that of an ' item girl ' ) required her to act over - the - top . Somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming . If you 've seen Rakhi Sawant ( who seems to be the inspiration behind this role ) in her interviews and Bigg Boss you 'll know what I mean . I strongly feel that if Nikhil Advani had taken Rakhi Sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like Priyanka , the story would have worked better . Salman Khan 's phony accent is ..... well , Shannon Esra 's Hindi is less accented than Salman's.<br /><br />To be fair to the director , he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film . I particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the Anil Kapoor - Juhee Chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence , and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman . But will anyone choose to paint their house in varying , depressing shades of grey ? That 's acceptable cinematic license I would say . But when the film runs almost for 4 hours , it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his ' touch ' in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences.<br /><br />Maybe Nikhil Advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible- pata nahin , kal ho na ho .
0 It 's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release . I mean ..... look at the cast here , the promotion is superb , good enough songs and the trailers are fine . This makes it a house full on the first day , but it 's only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable . House full the first day , the movie is out the next week . < br /><br />This film , inspired by ' Love Actually ' is what they say , did n't manage to handle the whole cast well . They tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one . The stories are hollow and cheesy , so the audience ca n't connect with any single one of them . It 's a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter Nikhil Advani after his big success of ' Kal Ho Na Ho ' .
0 OK the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY The director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH does his second half and wait < br /><br />He makes a 3:30 hours + film which loses on patience , time.etc The viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this film < br /><br />OK they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why ? 6 stories?<br /><br />We have the Anil- Juhi story convincing but boring do n't TV serials show such stories?<br /><br />We have Govinda- Shannon story which is funny and works well < br /><br />We have Akshaye - Ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy < br /><br />We have Salman- Priyanka story which is the worst , not just acting terms , it makes no sense at all < br /><br />We have Sohail- Isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories < br /><br />We have John- Vidya story a good story in all respects < br /><br />But then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy The climax is n't appealing though especially The climax of Salman- Priyanka story Nikhil Advani 's handling is alright at places , some stories are well handled but weak at places Music(SEL)is good , but too many songs Cinematography is nice , every story is given a different look , texture and it works < br /><br />Actors Govinda rocks , after a dismissal comeback with BB he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his part well , though he looks out of shape and tired John excels in his part , Akshaye Khanna overacts for a change < br /><br />Sohail Khan is too over- the - top and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissal < br /><br />Priyanka and Salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked?<br /><br />Salman Khan does n't act only , just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her , she does get better towards the end Vidya Balan is good , Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay
0 We all have seen some unending epics in our times , but this one really tops them all ! The movie is so long and so slow , that , just to put things in perspective , i felt a lot older when i left movie hall , than I entered it . At almost 4 hours length , it could have rather been made into a tele - serial.<br /><br />What starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace . Nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he ca nt make justice to any one of them ... There is no interconnection between them to start with , and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story.<br /><br />Situation is made worse by Silly dialogues ( most of them repeated in Hindi cinema over years)and stupid cinematography.<br /><br />Priyanka does n't realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen ... An utter waste of beauty without acting skills.<br /><br />And then there is loud - is - humorous Govinda & my - face - twists - better - than - jim - carrey Akshay Khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers.<br /><br />Only good part in movie is John & Vidya 's love story & nice acting / comedy by sohail & Isha . But they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters . Their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines.<br /><br />My guess - Director was making two separate movies(may be more ! ) and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records , beyond a point of sorting them out , so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie ... <br /><br />Watch it only if you want to test your patience ! ! !
0 Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes , " Salaam - e - Ishq " is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love ( which is at least four tales too many in my estimation).<br /><br />Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial , the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings , dazzling colors , sexy showgirls , high - stepping song - and - dance numbers , dream and fantasy sequences , winking character asides , corny dialogue and way - over - the - top comical performances - all pretty much standard - issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days . It 's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance , prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline.<br /><br />There 's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here - not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women - but he 'll need the patience of Job to get him all the way through it .
0 Six different couples . Six different love stories . Six different love angles . Eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater . Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen.<br /><br />I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what 's going on in the movie . All stories have got no link with each other , but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them . I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write . The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY.<br /><br />My suggestion . Do n't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie .
0 This is a sad film made for sad people . I was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart , wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe - inducing scenes after another . And there were people roaring with laughter behind me , which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse - s**t.<br /><br />Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters . The screenplay is dull , probably he was drunk when he was writing this film . There is no strong hold on any of these stories . Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before . One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it . I mean seriously is this story really required ? Its not funny , not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy . Another of the stories ( which was probably the only story I was interested in ) is based on a man 's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age - old sati - savitri pati - parmeshwar crap . I have no idea what the Salmaan - Priyanka plot was all about . There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot . She ca n't take Karan Johar 's film because she has to marry Salmaan ? ? Why ca n't she marry him and still take the film ? ? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors ca nt be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married ? ? With six actors in the film obviously Advani ca nt produce the film all by himself . So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group , shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines . And also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore ! ! I come to IMDb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film . It just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are . With fans like these , movies like Salaam E Ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit .
0 My sincere advice to all : do n't watch the movie.<br /><br />Don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played ! ! even a glimpse of it is bad for health . serious . no jokes . it 's 3.30 am in the morning . and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe . FOUR HOURS DAMN ! ! ! I am proud that i survived after all of it ! If this is called survival.<br /><br />i am highly frustrated . annoyed . disappointed . it was sheer waste of time ! money went in drain ! no plot . Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night ! ! RUBBISH MOVIE.<br /><br />Happy Republic day to one and all :)
0 The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall , allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain , let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded , perhaps then you * MIGHT * enjoy this film.<br /><br />The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie . Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl . Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted needlessly . Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re - union was just too much to digest . Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world , Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic , gravity , physics and throw an egg on the face of the * GENERAL * audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your own peril . At least I know I have been scarred for life :(
0 Six for the price of one ! So it is a bonanza time for Cinegoers . Is n't it ? Here it is not one , not two but all SIX - love stories , an ensemble cast of top stars of bollywood , plus all stories in the genre of your favorite top directors Johar , Bhansali , Chopra et al . You will get to see every damn type of love story that you enjoyed or rather tolerated for years now . So no big deal for you . Do you need anything more than this ? No sir , thank you . Why sir ? Enough is enough . Please spare us . They signed every top star that they manage to sign , whether required or not , so they end up making a circus of stars , believe it or not . Too crowded Every thing depicted here is exactly how it is prescribed in bollywood textbook of romances . Plus you have to justify the length given to each story , as each has stars . Therefore , it is too long - three hours plus . The gags are filmy . Characters are filmy . Problems , Barriers , situations , resolution   yes you guessed it right , again  . filmy - tried and tested . Same hundreds of dancers dancing in colorful costumes in background . Why they have no other work to do ? All couples are sugary - sweet , fairy tale type , Picture perfect . All are good looking . Each story beginning in a perfect way and therefore should ends also in that impossible perfect manner ? Too haphazard . You ca n't connect to a single story . Here you have everything that you already seen a million times . Bloody fake , unreal , escapist abnormal stories considered normal for more than hundred years since evolution of this Indian cinema . What a mockery of sensibilities of today 's audience ? Yes it could have worked as a parody if he just paid tribute to love - stories of yesteryear but alas even that thing is not explored . At least , Director Nikhil Advani should have attempted one unconventional , offbeat love story but then what will happen to the tradition of living up to the mark of commercial bollwood potboiler brigade ? Oh ! Somebody has to carry on , no . Imagine on one hand audience finds it difficult to sit through one such love story and here we have six times the pain . I mean six damn stories . I mean double the fun of chopra 's Mohabbatein ( Year 2000 ) In this age and time , get something real , guys . We are now desperate to see some not so colorful people and not so bright stories Oh , What have you said just now- come on , that is entertainment . My advice , please do n't waste your time henceforth reading such reviews . Go instead , have some more such entertainment ! Thank you .

Govinda and the Blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this Disastrous movie .

Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted ...... <br /><br />the only one not wasted is Salman Because he has No Talent what so ever to be wasted!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />all in all this is a very Impossible movie with Mishmashed screenplay and TOOO Masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes . imagine how stupid this movie is!!!!!!<br /><br />3/10 it is four hours long ! ! ! ! think and RETHINK before going to the cinemas ! ! ! ! ! better Avoid it ! ! ! ! !
0 this movie has lot of downsides and that s all i could see . it is painfully long and awfully directed . i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end . run time is way over 3 hrs which could have been edited to less then 2 hrs.<br /><br />transition between stories is average . most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come out.<br /><br />its funny only in pockets . ambitious project and a below par execution . govinda does a fair job , anil kapoor disappointed me , rest we as expected . if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close .
0 I have been waiting for this movie a long time . Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this , she 's a great actress.<br /><br />This movie contains six stories . It 's a new concept flew over from Hollywood . So it 's not a new item.<br /><br />1 . Khamini ( priyanka chopra ) is a dancer . She wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her . But then Rahul ( Salman Khan ) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend.<br /><br />Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress . When she yells , I get annoyed . Salman khan can not play comic roles . But in his serious parts he is marvelous.<br /><br />2 . Vinay ( Anil Kapoor ) is married to Seema ( Juhi Chawla ) . He gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman , with forgetting what he really has in life ; his wife and kids.<br /><br />Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural born actors / actresses . They are great . But this story is to thin for them.<br /><br />3 . Shiven ( Akshaye Khanna ) is going to get married to Gia ( Ayesha Takia ) , but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off.<br /><br />4 . Ashutosh ( Joh Abraham ) is married to Tehzeeb ( Vidya Balan ) . She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss . Now she does n't know that she loves her husband anymore.<br /><br />5 . Raju ( Govinda ) is a cab driver . He meets Stephani ( Shannon Esrechowitz ) who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but he is about to get married with an Indian woman . Raju has to bring Staphani to that man , but falls in love with her.<br /><br />I never liked Govinda 's movies . He is very annoying , not funny . But in this movie I liked him very much , like he has been growing up the last years.<br /><br />6 . Oh yes ! There is Sohail Khan ! He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati ( Isha Koppikar ) . He want to get some serious action with her , but every time her family comes in between.<br /><br />Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor , but he is funny ! I like his movies.<br /><br />Now here 's the problem . All these stories are n't interesting . To make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting ! Here and there the stories touch each other , but is not significant for the characters.<br /><br />My conclusion ; Priyanka can not act ! Loose that woman in the bollywood industry . Sohail Khan should make more movies , this role for him was too small . Salman Khan can not act comic roles , but real serious movies . That 's written on his life as an actor . This movie sucks , and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor , Juhi Chawla , Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham.<br /><br />It 's just like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan , and you only let him sing a lullaby .
0 I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November ! It looked awesome and the songs ! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it ! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together . It has a multi cast of 12 people ! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film . I think the director , Nikhil Advani , has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him . Compared to Nikhil 's directorial Debut ' Kal Ho Naa Ho ' , ' Salaam - e - Ishq ' falls quite behind . I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast . I think the best factors of this film is the songs ! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome , Shankar - Ehsaan - Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years . I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs ! One thing I was disappointed with , is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar . I found this extremely rude watching this with family ! Although , some may find this nude as comedy , it is not something you would want to watch with parents ! I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka Overall , I think its an alright movie !
0 Another big star cast , another glamour 's set , another reputed director , another flick filled with songs that 's topping the chart buster , but alas what 's missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture . So much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before it 's ' red carpet premiere . A hype which went to an extent where Anil Kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge . Well Anilji , which movie were you speaking of ? Well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people , who have a total different stance towards life , but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem , that 's LOVE . Well indeed a luring theme . But little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a multistarrer movie . These are kinda movies which I totally abhor because after spending a hefty buck for a multiplex ticket I get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax.<br /><br />The trouble begins right from the start . The director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets baffled as to how to share the time slot to six different star casts . Some of the couples like Anil Kapoor - Juhi and Sohail Khan-(Whoever the female is opposite to him ) just does n't make any sense for their existence in the movie . Salman ( Who calls himself rahul in a weird manner for the entire movie . Well something like Rahoooooool ) again as usual tries to be extra cool with his Videsi kinda Hindi accent . Hey Sallu Bhai , now that Aish is getting married , at least go get some tip from Abhishek to improve your acting abilities . A simple striptease would n't make the movie a box office hit every time . And Anilji stop shaving your trade mark beard or you look totally like a eunuch . And smooching a girl of your daughters ' age just looks as uncool as watching Jack Nicholson in a romantic movie . And please Nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot.<br /><br />The other bigger flaw in the movie was that there was n't any perfect synchronization between the stories of different couples . Every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks , put together to form a sadistic plot of Salaam - E - Ishq . Bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like Snatch , Memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline.<br /><br />Somewhere while I was evaluating the pre - release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie would n't do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28 , and 28 is considered a bad number in Numerology . But I totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not coz of its Numerology defects , but because of the myriads of flaw that persisted in the movie . And when director like Nikhil Advani can make such major blunders in the entire storyline of the movie , any wonder would n't have saved the movie from bombing at the Box Office.<br /><br />My suggestion for all you guys is , please avoid watching this movie at any cost . It is n't worth a pie that you pay for the ticket . There indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than Salaam - E - Ishq .
0 After seeing only half of the film in school back in November , today , I saw that it was on Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.<br /><br />The book that the film is based on , Hatchet , is OK . This is a terrible adaption of it though.<br /><br />Awful ( and I mean awful ) acting , bad dialogue , and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of Hatchet.<br /><br />The film starts off Brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen ( sporting a mullet , banging his head to cheap 80s rock music ) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged Dad ( his parents are divorced ... now cue the dramatic pause . ) Now Brian has said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying up to see his father . The pilot is a fat , ugly , rude man ( was n't like that in the book ) who after 2 minutes in the air , has a heart attack and dies . In the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack.<br /><br />The plane ( within another two minutes ) has gone empty on fuel ( leaving us , the viewers , to assume that he 's been up there for hours even though the sun has n't changed position and the scenery looks EXACTLY the same . ) Now 's he 's crashed landed.<br /><br />This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book . In the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips ( looks like he just bought it ) , it never said he climbed a mountain , saw a wolf , and fell asleep up there on the mountain , it never said he was attacked by a bear ( it said a moose but not a bear ) , it never said he eats the several bugs that he does , it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows , skin them , and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes ( that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes ) nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes.<br /><br />I do n't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado . All it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things.<br /><br />My favorite part of this camp fest was Brian 's lame flashbacks ( that are never mentioned in the book ) especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up , walking over to the window and seeing his Dad ( with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck ) leaving and screams " DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD ! ! ! ! " ( yet of course his father did n't hear him even though he was just right outside ) and he punches his fist through the window ( wtf ? ) < br /><br />The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book ( I said close . ) In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was " you 're the kid who they 've been looking for ! They stopped months ago ... " yet they left that line out in the movie.<br /><br />There 's a pathetic epilogue with Brian ( somehow without counseling or therapy ) getting back to normal with his family . I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving ( because they had a turkey on the counter . ) Then it shows his temporary home ( for what , in the movie , seemed like three days , but in the book was for several months ) and his hatchet , still in a tree where he left it ( also did n't happen in the book ) showing where he carved a message , so perfectly done : " HOME " ( where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet ? ) < br /><br />No quote can sum this movie up better then when Enid from Ghost World said " this is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again . " Perfect description of this movie.<br /><br />I would n't recommend it to somebody ( who has n't read the book ) and are just looking to watch a movie nor would I to somebody who has read the book ( because they 'll be disappointed and bored to death.<br /><br />For those who have read the book , leave what your imagination created as the movie . This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book.<br /><br />1/10
0 I had never read Gary Paulsen 's novel , Hatchet , for which ' A Cry in the Wild ' is the adaptation of , so I ca n't make any comparisons to the book . I will , however , say that as a film on its own , adaptation or no adaptation , it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.<br /><br />Think of ' A Cry in the Wild ' as a less luxurious , teenage mountaineer ( was Quincy , California the only place this was filmed ? ) version of ' Cast Away . ' Jared Rushton is 13-year - old Brian Roebson , a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father , until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain , leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.<br /><br />There are basically three parts to the film . The obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters , namely Brian and his mom . < br /><br />The next third of the movie ( which really consumes nearly all of the film ) is that of Brian " roughing it . " These scenes contain no particularly amazing action , nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape . Nothing to put you on edge , no real encounters ( except a brisk confrontation with a cub ) , and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen . You might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness Brian dealing with his situation through first , primitive means , and then more improved ones ( using tools , etc ) for his survival . It is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation , and that is pretty much about it . In other words , they put no meat on the Paulsen 's words when they translated them into a visual media.<br /><br />And , of course , the third part of the movie is his rescue.<br /><br />There is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time , however . Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky , awkward relationship between them . However , for the most part , it is only explained in brief , intermittent , minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video . Any minute , the singer from Jefferson Starship , should chime in an start singing ' Sara . ' Other than what the viewer can draw from the implications , or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative , we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters , whether or not it really had anything to do with Brian 's survival adventure in the third part of the movie . These are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and , for me , almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more ! < br /><br />It certainly was not , for me , a good adventure tale . But , for fans of Jared Rushton , it was one of the last few movies he made . So , watch it purely for nostalgia , if nothing else .
0 - Bad Stuff : This movie is real crap . Bad stunts for one thing , they looked so fake I thought this was " The Twilight Zone " . The flashbacks are pretty much useless . One part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better . I wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting , even from the adults was horrid . A kissing scene in this movie even sucked . This movie killed the book . The book was great . I highly do not recommend this movie . Not even for educational purposes . < br /><br />- Good Stuff : I do n't know what I can say really . There is some suspense parts that get you going , but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting . < br /><br />- My Verdict : Do not watch .
0 I wish I could give this movie a zero . Cheesy effects and acting . The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is . Lets start with the kid who plays Brian . What a geek ! I could n't believe the mullet ! Then there was the talking to himself . I guess they could n't just have the movie be silent , but still . Of course they had to have him skinny - dipping too , not something I wanted to see . But Jared gave a great performance , compared to the special effects department . Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself , and better . I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production , seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet . Finally , I do not think the writer had ever read the book , seeing as nothing was the same . I think the book was great , but this movie stunk like a smelly goat !
0 This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking . Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly - created character in an ill - fated movie , thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie . The film 's main thrust is how a boy 's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother 's extramarital affair . Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random " survival events " ( including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear ) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is n't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie ( and what a nightmare it is ! ) . Furthermore , despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film , there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing , including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded.<br /><br />All in all , a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to , much less innocent kids .
0 I came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better . Instead of what should be a gripping , tense story of a boy 's fight for survival in the wilderness , it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad.<br /><br />The film begins with Brian ( Jared Rushton ) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father . His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going - away gift ( what 's wrong with a Rubik 's Cube ? ) , little knowing how badly he will soon need it . Once in the air , the plane 's pilot ( a blink - and - you'll - miss - him cameo by Ned Beatty ) suffers a fatal heart attack , leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake . Extremely lucky to walk ( or rather swim ) away virtually unscathed , Brian must find shelter , food and hope for rescue.<br /><br />Here is where the main problem with the movie begins . By the very nature of Brian 's solitude , Jared has very few lines to speak , and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene . Instead , he is shown walking around , sitting around , and so on , with only a minimal sense of danger . As a result , too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents ' troubled marriage as the source of tension . These scenes merely get in the way and do n't particularly add much to the story . Even worse , occasionally Jared  his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two , which conjures up unfortunate parallels to ` Predator . ' Speaking of unfortunate , we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet , but it presumably helped keep him warm at night.<br /><br />Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother . Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie . For instance , we are never shown how they react to news of Brian 's disappearance , how they might be organizing rescue attempts , and so on . This is just one source of tension the film - makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey .
0 In my Lit . class we 've just finished the book , Hatchet , and this movie is nothing like the book . ( 1 ) Brian never ate worms in the book . ( 2 ) He did n't know the pilot 's name . ( 3 ) His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see . ( 4 ) The man the mother is cheating with does n't have black hair , he has blonde . < br /><br />Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie : ( 1 ) A thirteen year old ca n't punch his fist through a window in one punch . < br /><br />And for the acting , the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor . < br /><br />However , I do believe that the scenery was impressive , though I highly doubt the director even read the book.<br /><br />This movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet , by Gary Paulsen , but if you have , then begin a complaint letter to the director .
0 What horrible writing and acting . No personality . What , you ca n't make a good movie with a single character ? Hmm , it was done in Castaway with self dialog.<br /><br />So this kid goes on a trip to see his father . The kid , Jason , takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid - flight . So the kid crashes in a lake and survives . Then he runs around , surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued.<br /><br />During that time he fights a bear twice . The first time he fights it off in the lake . The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear . Two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bear 's chest reminded me of Monty Python 's " The Holy Grail".<br /><br />Also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results.<br /><br />Gag .
0 Ever wanted to eat worms ? Here 's a ' documentary ' to show you how ! Yeah ... The kid eats live worms ! And that 's about the most interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring . I 'm totally in agreement here . The movie just does n't go anywhere .... unless you 're fond of worm eating ! This is one movie it 's almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing much happens.<br /><br />Now on the technical side : They should have given that kid a haircut . Who 's he trying to look like anyway ... Bozo the Clown . It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something.<br /><br />And on top of that ; the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry ! Should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming.<br /><br />All in all , this movie nearly put me to sleep . And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting.<br /><br />I will admit that the scenery was very impressive . And had there been a decent story to go with it , it might have made a hit.<br /><br />It did seem safe enough for kids to watch : The bear scenes and the ' oddball ' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids , and the brief ' skinny - dipping ' scene did n't show anything.<br /><br />I gave this one a very generous 3 .
0 Ugh ! Another one of those " fooled by the cover " DVDs . I expected some kind of action at least with bears , cats , & such on the cover . I got NOTHING ! Bad movie!.<br /><br />I forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually SOMETHING would happen ... no luck.<br /><br />Now the reason I gave this a 2 is because of the scenery ; otherwise it sucked.<br /><br />The kid was terrible , talking to himself ( although I suppose they could n't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all ) , doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump , threatening a raccoon , munching on worms , and ( what a dumbass ) kicking a porcupine . And he would n't be pulling those quills out that easily either ... they stick like fishhooks . At least he fought the bear ( weakly ) a couple of times.<br /><br />What was up with the flashback thing ? It made a bad movie even worse . I wanted to see a survival movie , not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce.<br /><br />What else can I say ? Well , maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something . At least that would have been more exciting.<br /><br />People , do n't waste your time on this one .
0 Marie Dressler carries this Depression - era drama about a kindly bank owner , which recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month . If you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the Dressler - Polly Moran team , you 'll be disappointed , as this is really a very downbeat film . It 's also very poorly made , surprisingly so considering it came from MGM . Leonard Smith 's bare bones cinematography is strictly from the ' set up the camera and do n't move it ' school , frequently to the detriment of the cast , who find themselves delivering lines off screen ( it 's like a pan and scan print before such existed ! ) or having their heads cut off . The film does n't even have a credited director , underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production . Overall , it 's an unsatisfying mess , with Dressler frequently over - emoting and only that bizarre , final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart .
0 In 1925 , childhood friends Marie Dressler ( as Maggie Warren ) and Polly Moran ( as Lizzie Praskins ) oversee the wedding of their children , Anita Page ( as Helen ) and Norman Foster ( as John ) . Before the celebration , Ms. Dressler turns the reigns of her small town bank over to her son , Mr. Foster . Six years later , the Great Depression brings many bank closures , and financial insecurity . Banker Foster is able to survive , due to mother Dressler 's wise planning . But , Ms. Moran is worried about her fortune , and loudly demands a complete withdrawal . Other " Warren Bank " customers hear Moran 's rant , and start questioning their own solvency . Soon , the family is in financial crisis.<br /><br />Dressler 's huge critical and financial film hit " Emma " had been released early in the year , and MGM had to have wanted to get a new Dressler film out as soon as possible . Dressler 's 1931 hits , " Reducing " and " Politics " were still making a lot of money ; and , Dressler had become 1932 's US # 1 Box Office Star , according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications . " Prosperity " certainly celebrated Dressler 's status , but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy , and rushed . The cast does well , considering . Some more care in direction and editing , and some retakes , would have helped   apparently , they needed it in theaters for the holidays.<br /><br / > * * * * Prosperity ( 11/12/32 ) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler , Polly Moran , Anita Page , Norman Foster
0 Yes , Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running.<br /><br />Dresler is good . Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen.<br /><br />I watched this for Polly Moran , whom I 've seen elsewhere . Here , Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dressler 's shrewish friend / foe . Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />The plot is good hearted . Bad guys try to rob the townspeople . Dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />I do wonder about the central plot mechanism : bonds . This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly . I , however , not of that era , am vaguely familiar with them . They 're like stocks only different , right ? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity .
0 This one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short.<br /><br />The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom , but I guess the only way they could have been eliminated by Demolition was a double - DQ . Otherwise , Mr. Perfect would have had to put in overtime . Kerry von Erich , the I - C champ , was wasted here . And this was the third ppv in a row where Perfect jobbed . Remember , before that he never lost a match.<br /><br />The second match was very good , possibly the best of the night . Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent , while the Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights , pinning the Honky Tonk Man . Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel ( remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna ? ) . This was a foreshadowing of Bret Hart 's singles career , as he came back from two - on - one and almost survived the match . He and DiBiase put on a wrestling clinic , making us forget that the point of the match was DiBiase 's boring feud with Dusty Rhodes.<br /><br />Even though the Visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive ( and only the second since ' 87 to have four survivors ) , this match was not a squash . This was the longest match of the night , and Jake did a repeat of his ' 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated . I think he could have actually pulled off an upset . These days , the match would have ended the other way around.<br /><br />One of the shortest SS matches ever was also one of its most surprising . Possibly the most underrated wrestler ever , Tito Santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night , putting on war paint and pinning Boris Zukhov , Tanaka , and even the Warlord in the final survival match . It was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly , then go right back to his mediocre career . Sgt . Slaughter also did well , getting rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers , but that just was n't a surprise . Tito was.<br /><br />I think the only point of the survival match was to have Hogan and the Warrior win together at the end.<br /><br />This show was boring and the matches were too short . The Undertaker 's debut was cool , but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this one .
0 Here are the matches . . . ( adv . = advantage)<br /><br />The Warriors ( Ultimate Warrior , Texas Tornado and Legion of Doom ) v The Perfect Team ( Mr Perfect , Ax , Smash and Crush of Demolition ) : Ax is the first to go in seconds when Warrior splashes him for the pin ( 4 - 3 adv . Warriors ) . I knew Ax was n't a healthy man but if he was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card ? This would be his last PPV . Eventually , both Legion of Doom and Demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification ( 2 - 1 adv . Warriors ) . Perfect applies the Perfect Plex on Texas Tornado for the pin . He then attempts the same on Warrior but Warrior no - sells it and kicks out . Warrior comes back with a splash to pin Perfect and become the sole survivor . 5/10<br /><br />The Dream Team ( Dusty Rhodes , Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation v Million Dollar Team ( Ted Dibiase , Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues ) : The mystery partner is The Undertaker and , on his debut , makes an impact disposing of Koko straight away with The Tombstone(Monsoon still manages to say his correct height , weight and finishing move while pretending not to know who he is ) making it 4 - 3 to Dibiase 's Team . Niedhart power - slams Honky for the pin ( 3 - 3 ) and his career with the WWF is over . Shortly afterwards , it is Niedhart who falls victim to Dibiase with help from Virgil ( 3 - 2 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Rhodes next after an Undertaker double axe - handle off the top rope but does n't leave quietly attacking Brother Love . Undertaker goes after Dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man ( 2 - 1 adv . Dibiase 's Team ) . Almost straight after , Greg gets caught in a cradle by Hart trying to put the figure four leg - lock on him and gets pinned . It comes down to Hart v Dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling , Bret gets his body - cross reversed by Dibiase for the pin . Dibiase is the sole survivor . At least Hart is put to good use . 6/10<br /><br />The Vipers ( Jake ' The Snake ' Roberts , ' Superfly ' Jimmy Snuka and The Rockers ) v Visionaries ( Rick ' Model ' Martel , Warlord and Power and Glory ) : After spending some time in the ring , Marty Jannetty gets power slammed by Warlord as he comes off the top rope for the pin ( 4 - 3 adv . Visionaries ) . Snuka gets pinned in seconds by Martel who reverses his body cross ( 4 - 2 adv . Visionaries ) . Michaels gets caught in the Power Plex and pinned by Roma ( 4 - 1 adv . Visionaries ) . It is now Roberts against four men resembling his Survivor Series effort two years before . Despite hitting Warlord with the DDT , Roberts gets counted out chasing after Martel . The Visionaries are the first team in Survivor Series history to completely survive as one . Not much here worth watching to be honest as the psychology is rushed . 3/10<br /><br />Hulkamaniacs ( Hulk Hogan , ' Hacksaw ' Jim Duggan , Bigbossman and Tugboat ) v Natural Disasters ( Earthquake , Dino Bravo , Barbarian and Haku ) : One Bossman slam eliminates Haku early in the bout ( 4 - 3 adv . Hulkamaniacs ) . Duggan gets his 2 by 4 out after whacking Earthquake with it to get disqualified ( 3 - 3 ) . Bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing Hogan to cradle him for the pin ( 3 - 2 adv . Hulkamaniacs ) . Earthquake manages to overcome Bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards ( 2 - 2 ) . Hogan gets beat down and FINALLY Tugboat gets a tag ( who knew he was there at this point ? ) , he wrestles for about 30 seconds before getting counted out with Earthquake . Only Hogan and Barbarian left . Barbarian puts in some nice offence but inevitably gets caught in the big boot and leg drop for the pin . Hogan is the sole survivor . 4/10<br /><br />The Alliance ( Nikolai Volkoff , Tito Santana and Bushwhackers ) v Mercenaries ( Sgt Slaughter , Boris Zhukov and Orient Express ) : All of the Mercanaries wore camouflage face paint . Lightning quick pins here with Santana pinning Zhukov in his last PPV in seconds ( 4 - 3 adv . Alliance ) . There was n't even a Bolshevik showdown . Bushwhackers hit Sato with The Battering Ram even though Tanaka was the legal man ( 4 - 2 adv . Alliance ) and would be his last appearance on WWF PPV as The Orient Express get repackaged . Tanaka follows Sato when Santana stuns him with the flying forearm ( 4 - 1 adv . Alliance ) . Despite Slaughter getting in the ring against four men , he eliminates Volkoff ( who 's career is over after this ) , Butch and Luke in that order with relative ease . Finally , Santana beats Slaughter by disqualification when General Adnan hits him with Iraqi flag . At last some interesting booking even though the match was awful . Santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes his last finest hour . 3/10<br /><br />The egg hatches and it 's Hector Guerrerro in a silly outfit . He dances with Gene Okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while Piper and Monsoon pretend they are enjoying it . < br /><br />Match of Survival : Ultimate Warrior , Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana v Warlord , Power and Glory , Rick ' Model ' Martel and ' Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase : Just merely another catalogue of eliminations as Santana pins Warlord in seconds with flying forearm at least avenging his previous Summerslam defeat ( 4 - 3 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Dibiase stun guns Santana afterwards for the pin ( 4 - 2 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Hogan kicks out of The Power Plex and proceeds to pin Roma after a clothesline , effectively killing off Power and Glory 's push ( 3 - 2 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Hogan eliminates Martel by count - out and Dibiase with the leg drop for the pin ( 2 - 1 adv . Hogan 's team ) . Hogan finally allows Warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis Hercules after a splash . A very predictable ending to the point of nauseous . 2/10<br /><br />Overall , too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned . Most of the heels were decimated by Warrior and Hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers .
0 I 'd have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the ' King of the Cowboys ' ; made in 1948 , the picture came out a decade after Roy Rogers ' earliest pictures in which he had a starring role . Roy 's character comes off as a bit clueless in this one , along with his female co - star Jane Frazee , who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston , portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan . The whole story seems kind of muddled , with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so . Like the legend of the ' Hangman 's Hotel ' for example , which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight . With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher , you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up . Instead , you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick . It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve , who truth be told , wound up getting more screen time than Trigger , who 's contract as ' Smartest Horse in the Movies ' did n't have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule . And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude . I do n't know about you , but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh well ! < br /><br />Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough , and that turned out to be Roy 's athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys . OK , it was probably a stunt double , but I have n't seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns.<br /><br />Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture , as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 1947/1948 time frame . In " Under California Stars " , she appeared as Andy Devine 's cousin , appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher . You 're never quite convinced what side she 'll come in on in this story though , since she starts out pretending to be someone she 's not , and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident.<br /><br />Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown . I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role , but he played it pretty straight after all . I had to wonder , when it was all over , why he and old Vanderpool ( Charle Coleman ) wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be . Just a way to close it out I guess , with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture . I hate to be that harsh , but if you 've seen enough Roy Rogers flicks , you 've got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts.<br /><br />Say , Sintown - I wonder if that 's the same place that grew up to be Sin City ?
0 Roy Rogers and company try to bring " Sintown " back to life - it 's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful . Andy Devine ( as " Cookie " ) slapsticks around . Jane Frazee ( as Carol ) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Rogers ' sharp leer . Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand - in ( or , is that sing - in ? ) for the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers . James Finlayson ( from the Laurel and Hardy films ) adds to the " slapstick " look of " Grand Canyon Trail " . A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance . Mr. Devine 's mule kicks its heels . There are energetic human performances , too - but , the material is n't Grand . < br /><br / > * * Grand Canyon Trail ( 1948 ) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers , Jane Frazee , Andy Devine
0 This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel . It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera . It 's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome . Then it rewards the winner money . If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters , even better . While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality . < br /><br />This show has elements of several types of successful past programs . Reality television , hardly , but if your hooked on the contestants , locale or contest , this is your cup of tea . If your not , this entire series is as I say , drivel dripping with gravy . It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />It is slick & well produced , so it might last a while yet . After all , so do re - runs of Gilligan 's Island , Green Acres , The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch . This just does n't employ professional actors . The intelligence level is about the same .
0 How has this piece of crap stayed on TV this long ? It 's terrible . It makes me want to shoot someone . It 's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci - fi movie . I 'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense . I remember watching it when it first came out . I thought , hey this could be interesting , then I found out how absolutely , insanely , ridiculously stupid it really was . It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table.<br /><br />Please people , stop watching this and all other reality shows , they 're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create .
0 You do realize that you 've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years , right ? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co - exist on an Island , but you 'd think that after watching unkempt , stink - ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original ( and interesting).<br /><br />And I 'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable . It 's just hard to suspend disbelief for " Bushy Bill " eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make - shift bio - dome sipping frosty mochcinno 's with moxy.<br /><br />What 's the appeal here ? I do n't care about these people or their meandering lives . I just do n't get it . But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy , unwashed people , I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat . They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE , and free of charge , you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters , eventually striking " pay - dirt " and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein - styled cancer - stick , all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of " Aqua Velva " on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise . And the best part ? Much like Survivor , every week one member of the tribe " Leaves " the " Island " when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full - blown schizophrenia kicks into gear ! Now THAT 'S ENTERTAINMENT !
0 This is probably one of the worst French movies I have seen so far , among more than 100 french movies I have ever seen . Terrible screenplay and very medioacre / unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless . with all that it does n't matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story.<br /><br />One of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do NOT attract people , as an audience I do n't care what happens to them . < br /><br />It amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes , man , I love almost all the awarded movies in cannes , but not this one . A major disappointment for me .
0 The first ten minutes of " Just Looking " really dictates the direction most of this movie takes . Lenny ( Ryan Merriman ) is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the ' 50s . He has a burning desire to see two people have sex . Who are the best people he has in mind ? Well , his own mom and stepfather of course ! How pleasant . Unfortunately for Lenny , he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle 's wife.<br /><br />Lenny 's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex . However , the wife is quite pregnant and they are n't currently sleeping together . Then Lenny makes a new friend . Him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls . They have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex . The problem is ... it 's not done in an innocent , charming 1950 's sort of way . I am no prude by ANY means , but I found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation , blowjobs and anal sex . That kind of rawness may work in a movie like " Kids " ( 1995 ) but in this film it just seems perverted.<br /><br />Gretchen Mol is utterly wasted here as Hedy , a former bra model who becomes the object of Lenny 's carnal desires . Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away from the director 's chair as possible . " For Better Or Worse " ( 1996 ) was awful and now this . What a waste . 1/10
0 Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching , you better skip this one . I watched this one on television , so I did n't have to plunk down cash for it . Lucky me.<br /><br />The plot develops slowly , very slowly . Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable , it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end . It is highly questionable , if a seasoned soldier like Lt . Waters would disobey direct orders . And even if he would , if the rest of his platoon would . They know he puts them in direct danger , and they know they will certainly die if they follow him , but what the heck , he is our Lt . so let 's do what he says ( despite the direct orders , remember).<br /><br />Still , there are some nice scenes in this movie . They somewhat save a village , where the total population is being massacred by the rebels . Well , they save a dozen villagers or so , the rest was already killed . The strange part of it , that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind . They rather go on foot . Maybe because the roads are unsafe , but there was no explanation for it . Anyway . I think this was what earned the movie the one point I gave it.<br /><br />What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves . Only near the end they loose a few comrades . And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more . Can you believe that?<br /><br />They fight of an army of so many , kill hundreds of them , and only loose a few of themselves . And they have rounds and round of ammo . Never run out of it . Grenades and claymore mines , an M60 machine gun and even an RPG . Where do they get this stuff . Carrying it around or what ? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels . And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days . Really ? Who think up this crap.<br /><br />I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots , you give this movie a high rating . If not , skip this one . It saves you time .
0 ... for the Lt to have chosen this one . First , the film was n't horrible , it was just Hollywood . Worst case I - need - this - to - happen - or - we - have - no - movie scenario : if Willis ' mission was to save the doctor , but she was adamant that her " people " make it out of the missionary , he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her . He would not have compromised his package for the refugees . That 's not how it works . But , as I pointed out , this is Hollywood , we must have drama . This is why we make movies , because reality is n't quite so complicated . However , I did think that Willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry . That said , there are also some well done battle scenes in the film . It 's not a waste of time , " Tears of the Sun " is worth the dvd rental fee . Check it out on a rainy day and you 'll be satisfied .
0 If you like to be entertained , do not go see this movie . If you like to see heroics of war , do not go see this movie . If you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay , do not go see this movie . If you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war , GO SEE THIS MOVIE . Otherwise , do n't waste your time . I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well , they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war . This film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside , saying whorrible cliche lines , doing the most predictable things , and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed . This film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the United States of America ! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa , or any other country and watching this , being told that this is how Americans truly are ? No wonder everyone hates us ! Please , please , please , do n't waste your time on this piece of junk ; if you must , wait and rent it . 4/10
0 This is just typical Bruce Willis , action movie schtick . Watch it with some popcorn and your buddies . Rent it , to save money.<br /><br />None of it is realistic . The battles are n't realistic . The soldiers are n't realistic . The victims are n't realistic . And why was Tom Skerritt 's character talking to Willis from the DECK OF THE CARRIER ? What 's up with that ? He ca n't do that from inside the ship?<br /><br />Of course , Bruce W. gets a machete wound . There 's a bunch of average explosions.<br /><br />If this movie accurately represents the Navy SEALS , then do n't get stuck in Africa expecting them to come rescue you!<br /><br />The noble attack on the village bothered me the most . " Front row seats to an ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town . So what does he do ? He crawls into town on his belly . Yep . How many died while they were putzing around ? Oh well ... a body count was needed , I guess.<br /><br />And if that one African guy was so important , why did n't he get on the chopper with the elderly and children ? Can he say " Duh ? " < br /><br />Finally , the movie was very dark . Not just in plot , but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on.<br /><br />Rent it .
0 Considering the risk of showing same - sex relationships before the late 1980 's , Personal Best could have done better to play the same - sex relationship between Hemingway ( Chris Cahill ) and Donnelly ( Tory Skinner ) as a more than experimental phase of Cahill 's life.<br /><br />It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same - sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers . Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole . This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie . I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie ( the 1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition).<br /><br />This review may seem harsh , but it is the truth . The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway 's body and the same - sex relationship ruined any credit that I would have given to this film.<br /><br />Pepper Thompson
0 Bob Clampett 's ' Porky 's Poor Fish ' is a so - so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments . Set in Porky 's Fish Shoppe , ' Porky 's Poor Fish ' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black ' n ' white Porky cartoon and one of the books - come - to - life Merrie Melodies that were popular at that time . Typically of many of the early Porky cartoons , Porky is far from the star , appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film . For the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for . Unfortunately , the audience gets far less than they bargained for . As was sometimes the case in the books - come - to - life series , the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non - animated medium . Laughs are scarce and , while the cartoon is just about saved by Clampett 's energetic direction , there is very little at all to recommend ' Porky 's Poor Fish ' over any of the other below - par early Porky cartoons .
0 As a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event , I was very disappointed with the movie . Granted , the costumes and staging was quite authentic , but the Hollywood portrayal of this " British Little Big Horn " was truly boring.<br /><br />The amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history . Eveytime I heard triumphant background music begin , I knew I had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler . Obviously , the producers had invested heavily into " staging " and were determined to get their money 's worth.<br /><br />Despite the outstanding cast , their dialogue was , again , boring and their characters were never developed . Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene , I would cringe with disappointment . Their given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and the Bird Man of Alcatraz respectively.<br /><br />There are worse epics , but this one is not much better .
0 Billy Crystal co - wrote , co - produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy - drama about fathers and sons , adult irresponsibility , and growing old . Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack ( ha ha ) which causes him to seek out his estranged father ( Alan King ) , a movie - extra who fancies himself a big star . The script is sub - Neil Simon nonsense with one - liners galore , a flat , inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler ( stuck in sitcom mode ) , and family - conflict at the ready . Crystal and King try their best , but King is over - eager and frequently over - the - top . JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles , but manages to bring her innate , down - home class to the proverbial girlfriend character . It 's a comedy , I guess , but one that blinks back the tears ... shamefully . * * from * * * *
0 I like Billy Crystal , and I thought it would be fun to watch this film , since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together . I thought I had seen all Billy 's movies but could n't remember this one , and now I know why . It 's so full of clichés and phony emotion ; you can smell each scene coming ( and going ! ) . Billy does n't even get to be funny very often . He 's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down . Alan King himself is fairly likable , as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies . But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place , etc . etc . Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA . And when the end comes , boy , does it come quickly ! Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene . Mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor .
0 ( BIG SPOILERS ) I 've seen one other Takashi Miike film , and that was the very disturbing and brutal ' Audition ' , which was an examination of the Japanese ideals of femininity ! In ' Visitor Q'- which I think means ' Visitor Question'- he examines , in a very disturbingly gross way , the family unit . Miike 's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be Lynchian in terms of confusion and film - making , but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue . We , the audience , are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure ( Kenichi Endo- who was actually quite good ) paying for sex with his displaced daughter ( Fujiko ) . Then , as the father returns home , he is struck on the head by " the visitor " ( Kazushi Watanabe ) wielding a fairly sizeable rock , and for some reason , they both end up back at the family home . The mother ( Shungiku Uchida ) is beaten and bullied by her son ( Jun Muto ) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers . When the visitor enters the home , he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit . Eventually , the family begin to improve their relationship , with assistance from the visitor , through milking breasts , murder and retaining a sense of family pride.<br /><br />And there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together . It 's has uncomfortable humour , but is equally frustratingly silly , and over - the - top in its weirdness . There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting , but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses . Partly because of the situation itself , and partly because you ca n't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this ! The style of the film is poor to say the least , and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak . The characters themselves are all over the place , and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic , there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd ! The camera - work is sloppy , and does n't have that cinematic feel that Lynch 's work entails . It 's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level , or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in Japan . It just seems that Miike was out to shock , and the film seems self - aware that it 's " trying " to be shocking , and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously . All in all , I would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy , but it looks and feels amateurish , and seems to unnecessarily want to shock . Miike 's previous film , Audition , was finely balanced between disgusting horror , character development and technique- which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot . ' Visitor Q ' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting , without really having much to say in the process ! < br /><br / > * * out of * * * * * !
0 Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined . We have the submissive , heroin - addicted , part - time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body , lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son . Now , she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor , the release so gained somehow akin to Helen Keller placing her hands in running water . We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter ( she 's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague , having sex with her corpse , and then chopping her up . We have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom . You see , it 's all circular . Deep , huh ? The only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son 's tormentors . It 's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be . If that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious , no wonder most people think artists are insane . We saw this lousy movie , then put on " Zero Woman , The Accused . " Oh my God , it was a tossup as to which one was worse . What is going on in Japan these days ? Sick , sick , sick .
0 I actually retired from Asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish . However , I 've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently , and so decided to give them another chance . My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike 's highly rated ' Visitor Q ' . I 'd already seen Audition , and while I did n't like it much , I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films . So , I went into this with sensible expectations ; and unfortunately , found only boredom . I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head , but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them . Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I 'm concerned ; all Miike has done here is make a film ; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans , desperate to find some kind of meaning . My headache set in about 10 minutes in ( after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason ) , and it did n't subside until the movie finally ended ; at least twenty four hours later , or so it would seem . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around ; but while this may be violent , it 's also pointless and boring and I did n't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it . Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans , but I 'm certainly not one of them ; and I certainly hope this is the last time I 'll come into contact with one of his films .
0 This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie , set in Japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst . Nothing is sacred in this movie , with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i 'm surprised it got past the censors.<br /><br />Overall , i think it will appeal only to those whom we should n't be encouraging , rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider . A film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash ... A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition movies .
0 Okay , so I get it . We 're supposed to be horrified . The idea has been planted . A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it . Call me over the shock - rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this . But do n't expect me to watch a soft - porn and become horrified that she is ' doing her father' ... I mean has n't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with ' rape , and molestation ' porn ... Horror is n't what your mind can fool you into believing . It is what actually exists in film . This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure .
0 There is NOTHING cool , hip , or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema . How can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . SERIAL KILLERS ! If they have to dismember total strangers in order to " be a family again , " then we do n't WANT them to " be a family . " What part of that did you have trouble grasping ? Why applaud this filth?<br /><br />THIS silly filth is what you do if you ca n't do art ! One 's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as " interesting . " This is a camera without a brain . What really makes an artwork cool is profundity , questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history ( or , in this case , a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable ! ) . Instead , this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown , thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as " cool cause it 's so far OUT , man ! " ) . These same violent events actually HAPPEN , every day . They are NOT " just in the film . " They refer to actual soul - less people who would do those same things to YOU . Do you WANT those things done to you ? A child could have thought this up , it required zero imagination , it is NOT surrealism . This lazy crap has no content , is saying nothing -- it 's just the worst of the evening news , & it is saying nothing new , nothing we do n't already know . It 's " the emperor 's new clothes , " the director hoping there are enough uneducated children , proud of their streak of inhumanity , for this sloppy filth to fly . I can see director Miike 's demented fans now : chain - smoking teens - and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos , with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces , their knowledge - base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .<br /><br />There is NO PLOT to this -- it is just sheer exploitation of shock - value violence . There is no " hidden meaning " anywhere in this poorly made film . It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic , BUT you can not uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE ! To DO that you need to view & review a REAL piece of cinema . There are PLENTY out there , directed by Fellini , Bergman , Fassbinder , Herzog , Altman , Bunuel , Kurosawa , Lynch , Tarkovsky , Peter Greenaway , Tarantino , Guillermo del Toro , Richard Linklater , Eisenstein , Aronofsky , Gus van Sant , Soderbergh , Shyamalan , Ordet . Why do n't you view a REAL art film by the likes of these giants ? This wannabe director , Miike , will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just does n't have the talent ! Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like " Visitor Q. " Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon ! There 's no message , no meaning , no plot , nothing to it at all . There are long lists of ART Films to learn from -- but THIS " Visitor Q " is NOT an art film in any respect . It has no content to it . It 's just one banal horror piled onto another , and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN , every single day , somewhere in the world . They are NOT okay because they are " just in the film . " They refer to actual soul - less people who would do those same things to YOU . Do you WANT those things done to you ? To others ? Why ? Because this world is already ugly enough , thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this . < br /><br />There are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct , but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap . There IS no deeper meaning . There is nothing to analyze ; why keep trying ? I 've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made , and keeping up with all the new ones , but I 've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this . It 's not imaginative or even shocking , because these types of events happen daily all over the world . To make this film , or even to favorably review it , has caused over 50 young airheads who do n't know any better to think it 's " cool . " They may grow up thinking that , convincing others , some of whom may end up DOING these things -- convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way , by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity . Trust me on this ,-- I know cool , and cool this piece of crap AIN'T. Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film , and I 'm still not sure it is n't , actually . < br /><br />Your actions have consequences , son . The world is awful enough already . Some violence like this COULD happen to YOU , or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this FAKE Art film . Believe me , you wo n't be thinking it 's " Cool " when someone is sawing YOUR skull in half !
0 This movie stinks . I do n't think I have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value . The plot was relatively interesting , but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland . This could have been an a good movie . I think it just relied on it 's grotesque visuals . I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos , but it felt like Miike shot it for the sake of shooting it . Just one poorly executed film . There just is n't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest , pedophilia , necrophilia , rape , self milking , parental and sibling abuse , and fecal dispersement . I think I just sold the film to many of you , but I meant it when i said this stinks . He has succeeded in other films , but I think you 'd be better off watching someone pooping .
0 " Visitor Q " is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world 's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter , etc . The film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following . However , with home video quality and a slapdash production , " Visitor Q " just does n't hold up even as a curiosity . Genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible , make - up is awful , and everything else is amateurish at best . A waste of time . ( C- )
0 This movie was terrible . Throughout the whole movie , I was puzzled and did not see any point to it . I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about . This movie is not worth watching at all . Not only is it sick and revolting but totally STUPID ! Please do n't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies . If this movie questions Japanese society and their values and roles , than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know . This is a totally sick movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I did not enjoy it because it made no sense . My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under . It was total disappointment .
0 You know those films that have you trapped in the cinema ? You 're stuck there in the best seat in the house , centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there , uncomfortable and itchy , thinking " When the F * * * is this film ever going to END ? ? ? " ( You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village).<br /><br />Well , Visitor Q delivers a weird variant of that feeling . I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start ! It is interminable ! So " Arty " it hurts . This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched . Apparently he makes films by the dozen and , if they are all pretentious w@nk like this , I suspect it will be the last.<br /><br />I'm not against Pretentious w@nk . David Lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but Visitor Q is cut - rate , cheap , and nasty pretentious w@nk . < br /><br />As you may have worked out by now - I hated it .
0 His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi 's death , Aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.<br /><br />Instead , " Doctor Detroit " gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird , violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom . That 's bad enough , but he also has classes to teach , a school dinner to host , four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp 's Dinner ( or something like that ) to attend . No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time . Why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon . At least some good came out of this chaotic mess.<br /><br />One and a half stars . You want good Aykroyd , see " The Blues Brothers " . You want bad , see " Doctor Detroit " .
0 This movie is so bad , it can only be compared to the all - time worst " comedy " : Police Academy 7 . No laughs throughout the movie . Do something worthwhile , anything really . Just do n't waste your time on this garbage .
0 This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen . It is not funny . It is not interesting and should not have been made .
0 This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent . In particular , Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here . I might have chuckled once or twice during this film , but in general , it 's a boring movie , with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure . The premise , although routine , still was n't bad , but once the plot was set , the film went nowhere . Do n't waste your time with this misfire .
0 Horrendous pillaging of a classic.<br /><br />It was n't written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates . He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him , but he still does n't help himself at all with his actions . ( inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel ; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues ; lying about the knives , etc ... ) This , in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him , but this somehow does n't happen just so they can play the ' mistaken - identity - murder - game later on . Which in itself is also ridiculous : ' So - and - so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him ! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative did n't need extending.<br /><br />It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again , but that 's about the only small pleasure to be had . It 's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock , and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you should n't be bothering at all .
0 An interesting change from the first one . there was more mystery to this movie then the first . Even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer . There are some good parts through the movie , the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up . All up the movie is enjoyable . The story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film , Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to the Bates motel , but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother , things start going wrong . Perkins plays an aged Norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent , he swang that spade awfully hard .
0 " The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film " is not a film as such , but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme . This ' film ' got Richard Lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first Beatles film : ' A Hard Day 's Night".<br /><br />Richard Lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 . This film was entitled The Running , Jumping , & Standing Still Film . It was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production . Since the film was intended to be viewed by Lester and his partners alone , a small amount of money and time was invested . The sole purpose of this film is entertainment , but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera . The film cost 70 £ to make , and it was filmed in sepia - toned film stock in a field on a couple of Sundays . All of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production ; the finished production is eleven minutes in length.<br /><br />The Running , Jumping , & Standing Still Film is a comedy about English Sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time . All of the events in this film take place in a field . A few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn , a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record , a photographer developing film in a pond , an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model 's face , a man building a tent , an athlete running over the tent , and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun . Not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away , but it also pokes fun at English culture when compared to American culture . Another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite , which has been constructed out of the flag of the United Kingdom . One of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it , and the kite breaks . According to Neil Sinyard , author of The Films of Richard Lester , this event symbolizes the United Kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the United States during the space age . According to this scene , the British fly primitive kites while the Americans , the world - power after World War II , fly highly - advanced rockets and space shuttles .
0 People love the original story for its ending . The Hollywood style ending made this 99 version of ' A Dog of Flanders ' just for kids movie . I did n't cry this time because the story was too Hollywood . Japanese TV series are much better .
0 I rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version I saw as a kid . It was not . I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was marginal acting , poor character development , and most of all , failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog . In this version ... the " Dog of Flanders " is just a cute " aside " to the movie . Get the 1959 version !
0 The scenery is pretty and the dog is cute . Other than that , this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it . Jack Warden is pleasantly genial as usual , but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly . The plot makes no sense , the dialogue is dumb , and there are numerous smaller faults . But the dog is cute ...
0 Absolutely one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long time ! It starts off badly and just deteriorates . Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character . The only cast - member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore , who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role . The script is dire , the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double - decker bus through ! It is also the most sexist movie I have ever seen ! Katherine Heigl 's character is completely unsympathetic . She 's seen as an evil , wanton seductress who lures the poor , innocent married man to cheat on his wife . It is implied throughout the movie that she 's underage , and the message that accompanies that plot - strand just beggars belief ! At the end , she is n't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who 's obviously ( ha ! ) become demented with rage and guilt , but the script allows him to kill himself , thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere . Horrible . Do n't waste your time .
0 While it does crack the odd good joke , the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes.<br /><br />Unlike what an other comment says I do n't think this is the best RTE have ever made , its really dry and sarcastic . Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit , there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud . People seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which are n't really that good . Overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre . Its not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff . I find Benny Hill funnier .
0 Well , I 'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies . Still , it was more appealing to me for it 's moral value . I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite . My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie , " Hollywood Shuffle " . True , he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable , but his movies are still fun.<br /><br />Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel . I always felt that , if there were superheroes , they would n't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics . Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems : Car broken into , bad neighborhood , local drug - dealing gangs using children for distribution , etc . The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.<br /><br />What I found to be truly entertaining , outside of James Earl Jones ' " young forever " performance , was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers . It was n't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him , without his input , of course . It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.<br /><br />Yes , the plot was weak , the movie was predictable , there was bad acting and continuity was rotten , but it ranks # 1 with my kids . Robert Townsend works to bring movies " home " so to speak . I doubt he 'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor / producer / director he truly is , but there are and will always be , those that love him for his efforts.<br /><br />One point to ponder about the film , which I find amusing : Throughout the entire battle with Simon , no one bothered to call the police ? ? ? ? Also , what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window ? My mother would have been right there , scrapping by my side , toe - to - toe . Dad would be loading his pistol . lol < br /><br />Rent it and check it out . It 's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad , Luther Vandross , Bill Cosby , Big Daddy Kane , etc . Great job with the cameos Robert !
0 Let me tell you something about this movie . I have seen it twice . The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me . I really liked it . I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool.<br /><br />I saw it again a few days ago . It was horrible . Really . I do n't know why I thought it was funny before but now ... I did n't laugh at all . There was nothing even slightly entertaining . It was just dumb . The story was weak . The acting was nothing special . There are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best.<br /><br />What is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist . Really . Do n't get me wrong , usually I do n't complain about racism in movies . However I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like ' The Shaolin Temple ' or about the fact that the only black man in ' The Street Fighter ' is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever , you get the point . There are people seeing racism everywhere . I wonder how would they react to a movie like ' The Meteor Man ' . Why ? I will tell you why . There are no Asians in this movie . There are no white people among the good guys . In fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys . All the good guys are African Americans . Do n't get me wrong , I do n't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie . This is the only movie like that that I have ever seen . It is just not realistic . If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie which is the case with ' The street Fighter ' there is no problem - in Japan most of the people are Asians . But if there is only one white man in an American movie there is some sort of problem - in USA most of the people are white . It is like filming a Japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one Asian as a bad guy . Just not real.<br /><br />That is it . I am giving the movie the rate of 4/10 . It would be 1/10 if I had n't have fun with it as a kid .
0 The movie began well enough . It had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite , getting superpowers ( telekinesis , x - ray vision , invulnerability , flight , the ability to speak to dogs , superspeed , heat vision , and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly ) , and fighting crime . From there on it 's all downhill.<br /><br />Meteor Man gets a costume from his mom , fights with the resident gangs , and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing , overlong , and stupefying ending.<br /><br />It would n't be so remarkably bad if it were n't like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dance.<br /><br />Despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points . It states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they 'll come back to your home and hurt you . It states that gangs & communities need to see their real enemies ( the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence ) . It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them . The only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials ( Rudolph Giuliani , Marion Barry , Ronald Reagan , George W. Bush , & George H.W. Bush ) are n't crooks too.<br /><br / >
0 Superhero movies pretty much always suck , and this is no exception . Its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie COULD have been even worse . I would put ' Batman & Robin ' and ' Steel ' above this movie , so yes it is that bad ... <br /><br />If your looking for a black superhero , check out ' Blankman ' its not a " serious " superhero movie but at least its entertaining .
0 This movie is really wack . There is really nothing nice I can say about it , besides the moral truth expressed in the film 's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime . Besides all that , the film had nothing : no good shots , no good acting , and no good script . I give this film a F and a 2 out 10 .
0 Billy Chung Siu Hung 's ( the bloody swordplay film Assassin from 1993 ) film Love To Kill ( Hong Kong , 1993 ) is among the strongest products of the Category III boom that inhabited the HK cinema in early nineties . It consisted of films with strong sex , nudity and violence , more or less gratuitous and shock valued only . Love To Kill definitely belongs to the " more " category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness.<br /><br />The HK psycho Anthony Wong ( from the award winning The Untold Story by Herman Yau , from the same year ) plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture , humiliate and rape his young wife ( Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung ) who for some reason does n't leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor . A policeman ( Danny Lee , the famous police character actor from films like Dr. Lamb ( 1992 ) by Billy Tang ( and co - directed by Lee ) and The Killer ( 1989 ) by John Woo to name just a few ) however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but Anthony naturally does n't like this at all , and leads it all into the typical ultra - mean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm.<br /><br />The film is almost completely without any serious merits as it 's just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular . The imagery and happenings are something never found in the Western cinema , at least in mainstream , and it all becomes even more mind - blowing when some / most taboos for Westerners , like violence and perversions witnessed by a child , are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick , and that goes perfectly especially for this film too.<br /><br />The film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned Dr. Lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992 . Usually the music and soundtrack in HK films is interesting and adds to the imagery , especially in these terror films . Also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes , especially in the finale , in blue colors and camera lenses ( as does Assassin , too ) , and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera . Otherwise there 's nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastiness - meter.<br /><br />The actors and actresses are talented and professional and so do n't make the film any worse with their acting . Still the film has the usual HK humor in it which makes the sick goings - on even sicker as some " humor " is thrown into the soup . That includes some jokes about Danny Lee 's erection and so on .. Something that could never be found in the Western " serious " films either . And that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy HK films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses.<br /><br />The film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of Wong 's wife in various ways . She gets raped and molested , beaten and kicked by her husband . We also get to see some flashbacks from Wong 's own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now . These flashback scenes , mostly at the end of the film , include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up ( for example the hits of an axe ) and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene . Again something that only HK exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with . The ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails , for example , on his furious way.<br /><br />The film is also genuinely pretty " suspicious " in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should NEVER be taken as entertainment , mostly I mean rape . The version I saw ( I 've seen two versions ) includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible . I 'm not sure does the HK audience really like imagery like this but I think no one with some sense for morality in films / entertainment would never accept or make something like it . Women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females.<br /><br />The other version I saw , the newly released DVD in HK ( without subtitles ) has this " table brutality " scene in a much longer form than the subtitled Taiwanese DVD which is otherwise identical to the HK version . I 've also heard that the old HK Laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film , it is impossible to say how " uncut " versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are . Obviously plenty of footage has been cut out , possibly even before the theatrical release.<br /><br />The film is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin , the former having written also films like Dr. Lamb , The Untold Story and Gunmen ( Kirk Wong , 1988 ) but out of his other films that I 've seen , Love to Kill is the most gratuitous . Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one . The harrowing torture imagery of The Untold Story , the victim being the criminal , is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example . But there 's none of this in Love to Kill , it is just honest , calculated and fastly made exploitation which is , by the way , produced by a veteran director Kirk " Organized Crime & Triad Bureau ( 1993 ) , Crime Story ( 1993 ) " Wong!<br /><br />Love to Kill earns no more than 2/10 from me as I do n't have too high appreciation on films like this . ( HK ) Cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like Love to Kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art .
0 I sat through almost one episode of this series and just could n't take anymore . It felt as though I 'd watched dozens of episodes already , and then it hit me ..... There 's nothing new here ! I 've heard that joke on Seinfeld , I saw someone fall like that on friends , an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline , ect . None of the actors are interesting here either ! Some were good on other shows ( not here ) , and others are new to a profession they should have never entered . Avoid this stinker !
0 My kid makes better videos than this ! I feel ripped off of the $ 4.00 spent renting this thing ! There is no date on the video case , apparently designed by Wellspring ; and , what 's even worse , there 's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie ! The only date given is 2002 , leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he 's getting a recent film.<br /><br />This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made , that I 'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video . It might be of interest to students studying the counter - culture of the 1960 's , the anti - war , anti - establishment , tune - in , turn - on and drop out culture ; but when you read the back of the video case , there 's no hint that that is what you 're getting . If you do make the mistake of renting it though , it is probably best viewed while on drugs , so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors , Fassbinder and Fengler . Regardless of your state of mind while watching it , I can tell you that it does n't get any better after the first scene ; so , knowing that , I 'm sure you 'll be fast asleep long before the end .
0 Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me . My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in , what he called a pretty good sci - fi film , Nemesis . So as we watched this , we found ourselves fastforwarding through the BS drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences . Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick . And kick ! haha < br /><br />Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in . He finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the Mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family . Instead of joining up , Gruner tells the boy to fight back ( against a gang ? too crazy ) . Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone ( or maims them pretty bad ) and works to rid his block of these gangmembers.<br /><br />The plot was very cheesy and easy to think of . Gruner is probably not very well known because of his script - choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to . This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against Gruner 's character . The music was typical action music ( thumping pianos and timpani , swelling guitars ) which actually was n't as bad as I make it sound . The director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment.<br /><br />Ultimately , I gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action film for Oliver Gruner to star in , but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw .
0 Olivier Gruner stars as Jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a Mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it 's laughable . Bad acting , bad plot and bad fight choreography make Angel Town a Turkey .
0 Times are tough for Angel Town , gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown ( Mainly due to embarrassing writing ) the gangs want a street kid , Martine to join the gangs , so they beat him up everyday . However due to the presence of an Olympic kick - boxer ( Olivier " World 's lamest actor " Gruner ) named Jacques , hope is on the way . Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made ( And I 've seen my share ) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need , are French kick - boxers who ca n't act . Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it 's just truly hilarious . Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is . To Wit : " You like the fighting ? ( Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock ) I could kill him right ? When I want him dead he dies ! The reason why I do n't want him dead is because i 'm afraid of him , and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me , that 's why he does n't die ! " < br /><br />Of course the fact that it 's wrong to kill someone , let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation . Odd.<br /><br />However do n't let me make this sound that I hated this movie , far from it , it 's so terrible it 's priceless . The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang - members who ( the film 's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols . Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs , while Gruner kick - boxes the rest . All of this set to the sound of horrible " Mexican " accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.<br /><br />The other treat about this movie , is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that 's the main reason he 's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend ( In a graveyard in the film 's awkward beginning ) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level , this is the perfect movie for you . On the other hand make sure to down tequila , like the laughable opening song details " Ai n't no mercy in Angel Town " < br /><br / > * out of 4-(Bad )
0 I had watched " The Eye " before I watched this one . I really liked " The eye " , it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror - cinema . So , I picked this " Bangkok haunted " because it was the same director , and it was kind of popular round here . But man , what a disappointment ... " Bangkok haunted " are three stories about love , revenge , ghosts , etc . that are no scary at all , not even disturbing ( as " The eye " was ) ... no nothing .

0 The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy , quaint streets and sunshine . I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere , but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere.<br /><br />Othello works for big , fat Mr. Karva , his crime - boss step - dad ( at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it 's never really defined , but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers , so trust me , he 's a prick ) doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand - jobs . One of his colleagues is Runner , a black dude who is always dashing from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running . Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello 's flat , where he promptly starts granting more wishes . Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled , Karva has the boy kidnapped . But he is n't sure of what would really bring him happiness . Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand - job ? Either way , I do n't want to see the little boy grant him the second.<br /><br />It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes . The ending tries to be shocking but since there 's hardly any back - story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience.<br /><br />Writer Tony Grisoni , a favourite of Terry Gilliam , tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell , ironically . If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film . As it is , we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy . Who 's origins are never revealed . That 's just plain irritating ! < br /><br />Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score , this film has little to recommend .
0 Without question , the worst film I 've seen for a long while . I endured to the end because surely there must be something here , but no . The plot , when not dealing in clichés , rambles to the point of non - existence ; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed ; characters never develop beyond sketches ; set - pieces are clichéd . Worse , considering its co - director , the photography is only so - so.<br /><br />Comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside Get Carter , Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are way way off the mark ; Lives of the Saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading . In short , their craft . A ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30-minute short , but as it stands it 's a 6th form film project realised on a million - pound scale ; rambling and bloated with its own pretensions . That it received funding ( surely only because of Rankin 's name ) while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the British film industry .
0 i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments BUT after sitting through most of rankin 's dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it ! i could n't actually make it right to the end , and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs ( about 1/3rd of the audience ) after the ragged plot , woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear . this film is all pose and no art . all style and no substance . it is weighed down by dreadful acting , a genuinely dire script , indifferent cinematography and student - level production values . how it got funded , started , and finished is a mystery to me . i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release . the proper critics would tear it apart . a really bad film . shockingly bad . a really really really poor effort AND that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new - born - kitten - gets - dropped - into - a - deep - fat - fryer moment . totally meaningless , utterly lightweight , poorly put together ; this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema .
0 This is a very odd film ... I was n't really sure what is was about , some N London lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all , in their own way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster . The film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied , almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all . I did n't care about any of the characters - none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer.<br /><br />What was the message ? Am I being dim ? It was just too odd . What happens to Runner ? Why does Emilio shoot the kid ? ... that made absolutely no sense , pointless . Can someone help me understand this mess of a film ?
0 RUN ... do not walk away from this movie ! ! ! ! ! Aimed at the very young kids , this movie will bore you to tears . If the Gamera trilogy of the 90 's raised the bar , this film just lowered it . It 's slow paced and the monster fighting is good , but seldom seen . This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box . Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90 's series.<br /><br />SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90 's series will HATE this film.<br /><br />10 . This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die.<br /><br />9 . You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film . He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs ? ? ? He looks old and lethargic . Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you 've ever seen . His suit looked cheap and rushed.<br /><br />8 . The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon . Big - eyed and cute ... it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 . Gamera is now too cute.<br /><br />7 . This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay . I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along . I 've seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster.<br /><br />6 . Like Godzilla : Final Wars , this movie had very little kaiju time on screen . Final Wars had much more , actually , and better fights although short.<br /><br />5 . Kids take the title role . The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970 's and history repeats itself in the 2000 's . The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place . Why go back to a failed formula ? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue ( thank god).<br /><br />4 . Gamera lost his iconic roar . He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat.<br /><br />3 . This movie may produce a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm 's way . You have to see the ending to understand this point . Where were the parents ? Oh yea .. right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone.<br /><br />2 . The special effects were good , but sub - par for a Gamera movie . Legion and Iris had better effects . The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly . Not too impressive.<br /><br />1 . This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect . The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows . It comes off like a cross between ET , Always : Sunset on Third Street and TMNT . Kudos if you know all 3 references.<br /><br />Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series .
0 An illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many . Well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced , yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion . The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed . The little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate , but I can not endorse going out of your way to see this movie .
0 Some illegal so - called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and finds that Germans are " racist . " < br /><br />This is just another already - forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post - WWII anti - German propaganda films , aimed to make Germans feel " bad " for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers.<br /><br />If you 're looking for good German films in General , see " Der Tunnel , " " Der Untergang , " " Europa Europa , " and " Lola rennt." < br /><br />But not this.<br /><br />Also , " Das Experiment , " with the same male actor from " Lola rennt . "
0 I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less . Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face . See , 19 words , however , I did n't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80 . My advice , take the $ 4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck , or you may want to send me the $ 50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice .
0 Oscar Wilde 's comedy of manners , perhaps the wittiest play ever written , is all but wrecked at the hands of a second - rate cast . Sanders is , as one would expect , casually , indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington , but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time . Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy ; indeed , the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the Hays office insisted . Preminger 's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal . Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne ; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words . But skip this version .
0 this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself . I first saw the trailer in 1991 , it looked great . Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it ..... until today , yes , 14 years later.<br /><br />lets just say I was so disappointed its unreal , OK i knew it would n't be an Oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no - brain film in the bloodsport mold . Unfortunately it was not , it 's Pooh < br /><br />whats with all the American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening.<br /><br />The fight scenes were rubbish and look fake.<br /><br />this DVD only cost me £ 5 and I believe I was overcharged by £ 7<br /><br />Now I 'm sad as I know that I will never get that hour and a half back .
0 This seemed to be a good movie , I thought it would be a good movie , and throughout the movie I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time , and yes , I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable , but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message , which it seems is it seemed was what Somnath Sen is trying to do . The final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens ; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied , if indeed that was the director 's intention . This falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most.<br /><br />Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo - typing of the American characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block . Seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based upon how common Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the movie.<br /><br />These two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story .
0 Genghis Cohn is a ( very ) mildly entertaining British movie about a German police commissioner in the late 1950 's who is haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under Hitler in the SS . The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committed.<br /><br />Otto , the German policeman actually knows this ghost 's name because , the last thing he did before he died was said , in Yiddish , ` Kiss my ass ' . The policeman did n't speak Yiddish , so he asked around until he found the meaning . The ` kiss my ass ' left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian 's name , Genghis Cohn.<br /><br />There are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner , and there are no helpful clues . The men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher . The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich , so the commissioner is a suspect . The first man is killed while making love to the butcher 's wife , so the butcher is a suspect . But the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife . All the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking.<br /><br />I think I might be a bit angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn if I was killed like he was . He seems to be very good - natured about it , as if he was just in a mild car accident . I can only guess that it is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite people . He uses some of his material from his stand - up routing , and I just did n't find it very funny.<br /><br />I gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy . I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was . The movie turns out to be a murder mystery ( where did this come from ? ) , and it seemed that Genghis should have been more helpful than he was . The movie gave me a tiny look into Jewish culture , but was only skin - deep . Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches ? Do they all say ` shtoop ' and ` meshuganah ' in their daily vocabulary ? Is n't there more important stuff that we should know about the culture?<br /><br />I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley , CA , and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white . ( I have no gray or white hair . ) There were 18 of us , and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie . There were 2 main concerns expressed there : 1 . The movie was way too light - hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 . As the Holocaust survivors are dying off , future generations will not know what really happened . I thought that this second concern was ridiculous and I told them I thought they did n't need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies , like myself . The murder of 6,000,000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten . I write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day .
0 Yuck . I thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written . The acting is so apathetic at times and so over - dramatic at other times . Why would a " demonico " kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal ? Just for the heck of it ? And is it really necessary to show Lilith 's motorcycle whenever she 's out somewhere . We get it ! You spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket . It does n't mean you have to show it all the time ! The " Faith 's " lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes . There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance . Everyone is a throwaway character . Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill - conceived movies I 've seen the SciFi channel come out with . Stay away unless you 're into bad movies .
0 This obvious pilot for an unproduced TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man - turned - flying demon is let loose on the world . The CGI is par for a TV job , and Appleby is OK as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine . Familiar TV face Richard Burgi is along for the ride as Appleby 's mentor , but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level . We see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start , a bad sign . Also , the scenes where Burgi is training Appleby for battle are actually laughable . They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies , most notably REMO WILLIAMS .
0 Shiri Appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon - kicking Buffy clone , Elle . But I 'm getting ahead of myself , you see Lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to Adam . But she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from Eden . A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but does n't kill her , so now with amnesia ( which is not really explained that well ) Lilith ( now Elle ) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy - clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of Lilith 's blood . < br /><br />If the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted , that 's because it is . The movie is also dull , generic , and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it does n't seem to know a lick about it . This bargain basement lousy - CGIed movie was apparently a failed series pilot . All I can say to the fact that it did n't get picked up is a resounding Amen.<br /><br />My Grade : D-<br /><br />DVD Extras : Commentary by Writer / Director Bill Platt and Co - writer Chris Regina ; and Stills gallery ; video effects samples : before & after ( it also has an " also available " selection that you would THINK would lead you to some trailers , but nope on DVD covers for other films , which is a stupid idea)<br /><br />DVD - ROM extras : Final shooting script and Deleted scenes transcript both in PDF format
0 A good idea , badly implemented . While that could summarize 99 % of the SciFi channel 's movies , it really applies here . I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed , and I like action movies , and I like all of the main actors , so this could have been great . However , despite some good acting , this movie fails due to Bill Platt 's bad writing and directing.<br /><br />Another review made the good point of needing to know where you 're going so you can get there . This movie does n't . It 's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words " second draft " are not in Bill Platt 's vocabulary . There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing . This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car , so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others , some to the point where you can guess the entire " plot " up front . It also had a habit of aborting a fight early , probably just because they could n't afford it . There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the " plot " is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed " toxic adhesive " ( seriously , what * is * that?).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby , watch this movie because she 's OK . She does manage to break out of her " Roswell " persona a few times and make for a good tough chick ( but not always ) . John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he 's ever done since playing Q back in ST : TNG , so that 's nothing new.<br /><br />In all , I gave this movie a 4/10 rating .
0 The story behind this movie is very interesting , and in general the plot is not so bad ... but the details : writing , directing , continuity , pacing , action sequences , stunts , and use of CG all cheapen and spoil the film.<br /><br />First off , action sequences . They are all quite unexciting . Most consist of someone standing up and getting shot , making no attempt to run , fight , dodge , or whatever , even though they have all the time in the world . The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.<br /><br />The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects , but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.<br /><br />Pacing : everything happens too quickly . For example , " Elle " is trained to fight in a couple of hours , and from the start can do back - flips , etc . Why is she so acrobatic ? None of this is explained in the movie . As Lilith , she would n't have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she could n't , since she had wings.<br /><br />Also , we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car , and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror , and then stabbing herself in the throat , all for no apparent reason , and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car ( and then felt the secondary effects of another , exploding car ) ... " Are you okay ? " asks the driver " yes , I 'm fine " she says , bloodied and disheveled.<br /><br />I watched it all , though , because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end , the poor execution made me wish for anything else : Blade , Vampire Hunter D , even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comic relief , because they managed to suspend my disbelief , but this just made me want to shake the director awake , and give the writer a good talking to .
0 I sat glued to the screen , riveted , yawning , yet keeping an attentive eye . I waited for the next awful special effect , or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force , so I could learn how not to make a movie.<br /><br />It seems when they set out to make this movie , the crew watched every single other action / science - fiction / shoot - em - up / good vs. evil movie ever made , and saw cool things and said : " Hey , we can do that . " For example , the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking , is the one car the protagonist , an attractive brunette born of bile , is thrown on to . The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it . The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie . But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility , and lack of reason for so many elements ! For example , the antagonist , a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways , happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP . Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck , you know they are already dead . Then the guy protecting the VIP says " Under no circumstances do you leave this truck , do you understand me ? " He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies , he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion . Then for no apparent reason , defying logic , convention , and common sense , the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK ! ! ! A lot of what happened along the course of the movie did n't make sense . Transparent acting distanced me from the movie , as well as bad camera - work , and things that just make you go : " Wow , that 's incredibly cheesy . " Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1 , because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience , sex appeal .
0 What is interesting is that the acting ; was not bad , just not enough . It was rather lame . , special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure . Standing alone they were n't horribly bad , but put together was a tragic move . The show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along , but it failed totally.<br /><br />Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects . Don't believe it , they were kinda cool . Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor . Though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton . An experienced actress would have brought something to the part , like Appleby never did . Scfi puts out some really good original movies , it 's just too bad that this failed so drastically .
0 I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time : Darklight.<br /><br />The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam 's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam 's equal and refused to submit to him . See , I took those words straight from the script . Then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film , the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do ! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group!<br /><br />Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful . Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film , there was nothing original about Darklight .
0 This is an interesting left turn for Reel 13 Indies . TWO HARBORS is a B&W 75 minute film from Minnesota that features non - actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life . I applaud the boldness of the Reel 13 programmers of thinking out - of - the - box when selecting this film . I just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with . As a matter of fact , I wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself ( Not that TWO HARBORS is completely without merit , but I 'll get to that a little later ) . < br /><br />As is common with independent films , TWO HARBORS is limited in terms of location . There are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer , which is the home of the middle - aged main character , Vic , played by Alex Cole . Writer / director James Vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about Vic , who is one of the dealers there . He has various people walk up to Vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  Vic sells space toys ( he prefers to call them " outer space action figures " ) and he is a caustic asshole . This is emblematic of one of the two key problems with TWO HARBORS - all the chatting . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually . There are exceptions , of course , but generally , endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition . Pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose . A notable example would be a few scenes which feature Vic trying to play himself off as a Boy Scout leader in order to get a discount at a store . He argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes do n't even advance the plot one iota . This is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.<br /><br />The other problem with TWO HARBORS is the acting . I may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film , but I really do n't feel like there 's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films . There are plenty of good actors out there , many of which willing to work on low - budget projects  even in Minnesota . Many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals , but that is naïve . In narrative film - making , next to the story , nothing is more important than the acting / performances . If you do n't believe the people enacting your story , your audience is lost.<br /><br />Originally , I thought Vculek was using non - actors , but as the film went on , I decided that they were probably community theater - type actors . It was n't that they were uncomfortable on camera . It 's that they were overly theatrical ( i.e. big ) . Granted , the best of the actors were the two leads  Cole and Catherine E. Johnson as Cassie , a lonely young girl that gets caught up in Vic 's extra - terrestrial hunt . They seemed to have the most training , but they were still a little rough around the edges . The eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real , organic place within . Ms. Johnson , in particular , is an interesting case . She definitely has a presence  a Midwestern charm about her , but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have . She struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and ( slave ? ) labor , relying on stock gestures like eye rolls , lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.<br /><br />I mentioned in the first paragraph that TWO HARBORS is not completely without merit and here 's what I mean . Without giving too much away , there is a fade to white an hour into the film . After that , the story takes a stunning turn , which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it 's like a sucker punch to the gut , but in a good way . It 's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters . The last five minutes of the film do n't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle , detailed ( Cole does his best work of the film ) and most importantly , cinematic . Then , with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it 's based on a true story , which got me to thinking . With all the dialogue , the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities , it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re - write , TWO HARBORS might make a really kick - ass stage play  maybe even a one - act . If there are any bold theater producers out there reading this , I definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker , Reel 13 or whomever . There might be something to this story after all  < br /><br />(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film , check out their website at www.reel13.org )
0 I get it the Diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every rock , only to find out at the end that it 's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good - will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops . Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason , polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well - made , amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters , dialog and plotting . Better luck on your next flick . Another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of LA being there for reasons of hunger , these people do n't get enough to eat . Truly these folks are n't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger , an emotional hunger , a mental hunger . They need self - respect , self - worth , dignity which you ca n't give a man . Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available . Less the center for hunger in America , I would say it 's more the center for alcoholism , drug - abuse , mental suffering and economic devastation . Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band - aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age - old human problem of homelessness . Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet ( cliched ) old soul .
0 Watching " Der himmel über Berlin " as a teen in the late 80 's was a profound experience for me - " so this was what the movies could be " . Along with " Paris , Texas " and " Until the End of the World " it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders.<br /><br />Unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with " Million Dollar Hotel " and " Land of Plenty " hitting a terrible low point . Gone are the captivating pictures or music . No search for or display of great insight . All that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements , that boils down to nothing but clichés , and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience.<br /><br />Has the well run dry ? Whatever the reason , it 's time for Mr. Wenders to either step it up or stop altogether .
0 With a tendency to repeat himself , Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with ' Paris Texas'.<br /><br />'Land of plenty ' is no exception . Taking into the fact that I anticipated an average - mediocre film even before I went in , Wenders ' ambitions seem to always get the better of him . It 's taken for grated now his films are heavy - handed and bombastic.<br /><br />I were n't sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Middle America or some thriller . The outcome of Diehl 's character is wholly predicable . Wender 's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying . He was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes.<br /><br />I am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly , this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction.<br /><br />Interesting that Wenders professed that while making ' Paris Texas ' , he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script . Yes , that was Wenders ' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter . His films from the past 15 years+ were a total mess .
0 The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel hinted at the idea the Wenders has lost his vision , his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture . The Land of Plenty seals the coffin , I 'm afraid , by being a vastly unimaginative , obviously sentimental and cliché'd film . The characters are entirely flat and stereotyped , the writing , plot and direction are amateurish , at best . For the first time in quite a while , I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life . The war - torn delirium of the uncle , the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion ... it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic , hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen . What happened ? The days of experimentation , perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him , I 'm afraid . Let 's hope he finds his inspiration again ... At the Toronto film festival , which is where I saw the film , Wenders was there to introduce it . Completely lacking in humility , he offered us the following : " I hope ... no , wait ... I KNOW you 're going to enjoy the next two hours . " I 'm afraid he could n't be more wrong ...
0 i ca n't believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end . and it did . the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer - so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird . no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did . and probably the worst prosecutor on earth . why was he in court anyway ? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty . a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings . but no go . he preferred to say " objection " 2 or 3 times during the whole trial - that was it . the blonde lunatic was given a truth - drug to prove her innocent but not Brett . the lunatic almost had an altar of Brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession . but again no go . during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head . even real weirdos do not look that silly fake " i am innocent " like she did . and what does this movie tell us ? never marry a woman with a life insurance : as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail , guilty or not . evil , evil men .
0 .... may seem far fetched .... but there really was a real life story .. of a man who had an affair with a woman , who found out where he and his new wife were staying , , and she killed the wife , , making it look like a murder rape ....... <br /><br />in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him .. so she quit her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /><br />last I heard she was in a mental institution , Security Prison .... <br /><br />she was still wearing the " engagement ring . " that she has purchased for herself ... and had told everyone that he had bought it for her.<br /><br />The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin , , , , , , , and the murder happened in Minnesota ...... <br /><br />There even was a feature story in " People " magazine ... Spring of 1988 , I want to say on Page 39 . I remember this as I was in college at the time , , and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the Security Hospital ....
0 I could n't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all . With the worst actors you could find , the worst script written ( Mark Frost & Sollace Mitchell ) and by far the worst waste of time in viewing . I wo n't belabor the story as it 's really not worth it . But I will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story . As to the story , it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did . That in reality the wife could n't defend herself against a little bitty of a thing . That the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all . That the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up . And the final result of the film is an insult to justice , movie codes , and the male species . The theme of this mess is let women do as they wish , kill whom they want , defend the killer and get away with it , while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim . Hard to believe that Sollace Mitchell , the director and a man , would even want to make this dribble.<br /><br />As to the acting : Jordan Ladd , the killer , is awful . A loony toons , who does needlepoint during her murder trial ( is this allowed in court ? ) She bored me to the hilt . One more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and I 'd throw up . She 's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife . The husband , played on one level by Vincent Spano , just seems to look and act stupid most of the time . He was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him . The worst by far was Holland Taylor as the Defense Attourney . She over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice . If she would cross examine me anytime , I 'd have told her to go take a hike . Everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so.<br /><br />I wish I could give this film a zero rating . However we are forced to start with 1 . Too bad . Let 's not have anymore painful watching films like this . Lifetime can do better then this , I know it.<br /><br />This is a postscript : Made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake . As soon as I saw the bimbo Jordan Ladd I knew I 'd seen it before and did n't like it or her . I not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like Sollace Mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick . Doesen't anyone see that her / his message is that sickness pays . Being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director / writer . Totally making the male species idiots . Well , this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful . We 're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie , which in this person 's mind deserves to be trashed.<br /><br />And again this loser is shown . Why ? ? ? ? Ca n't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie ? Are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo Jordan Ladd again and again ? Get her off TV , films and out of sight . She 's just terrible in every sense of the word . Phew ! ! ! !
0 Jesus Christ , I ca n't believe I 've wasted my time watching this movie . I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd . But watching this film almost put me off her . This is absolutely awful ! I could have been watching Survivor Series 93 over this.<br /><br />The lead guy in this was so bland and generic . I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove ' 91'd his ass through a glass window . I was enraging every time he was saying " lake " and " cabin " . I 'd kick his ass.<br /><br />Jordan Ladd , on the other hand , was absolutely wonderful . A true angel . But she could n't even save this utter joke of a film . Sadly , she could n't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug . It looked hilarious.<br /><br />I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her . It reminded me of a time where ... nevermind.<br /><br />Anayways , do watch this film because of it 's awfulness .
0 If this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic , it might ( i say might ) have been a hit . Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults ? Well this is it . Every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards . It would be hard to find another film , with this kind of production budget , that contains so little of any value whatsoever . The whole thing , from the opening scenes defies logic . Dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical . Ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself . What is really mind boggling , is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash . Wow .
0 You know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies ? Well if you 've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest , then this movie is for you . It truly was like a porn without the sex . Or if that analogy is not to your liking , imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench . This is the movie that you would make . -Horrible acting -bad camera work -Music done on a casio keyboard This movie has it all , and more . For those who are masochists in the crowd , this is a premiere piece for your collection . < br /><br />All I can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie , were people who ' starred ' in it . < br /><br />Their movie career is over before it started .
0 Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around , mostly due to the popularity of movies such as Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series.<br /><br />It starts at a television station , which is guarded by the military , and are reporting that The Lazarus Virus ( zombies ) are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again . The problem is , this is totally false . Zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware . Among them are Torch ( William Garberina ) , the camera man , Sherry ( Rachael Morris ) , the lead anchor woman ( who for some reason is listed as playing Shelly on this website ) and Roger ( Patrick Cohen ) , their military escort . Torch and Sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service ( or some other government agency ) and they are heavily censored.<br /><br />This movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box - cover saying " We hold FEEDING THE MASSES on a higher level than any o the three ' of the Dead ' films by George A. Rombero . " The source of that quote has lost ALL credibility with me.<br /><br />Let me just say that this movie is BAD . I do n't mean bad like I was expecting more ( I obviously was , though ) but I mean bad in that I could not find any redeeming qualities in the film , whatsoever . The acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden . Did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards ? I ca n't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor / actress . There really was not one . If I had to give a nod to someone , I would say Roger , the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much.<br /><br />I would have to recommend to pass on this movie , despite the box - cover looking pretty good ( It 's what originally drew me to the movie ) . 3/10
0 Some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies , despite the ' government controlling the media ' . The makings of the film do n't understand that the George Romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films ( " Land of the Dead " withstanding ) . This satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario . What 's subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction ? Anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter - cut with the film ? Nope . Furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible , the characters thoroughly unlikable , and the plot inane . Add this all up and you have the worst , most incompetent zombie film since , " C.H.U.D. 2 " reared it 's hideous head.<br /><br />My Grade : D
0 this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ... ever . and what is up with the casting . the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis - figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose . you could go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified , better looking possible leading ladies . i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a " cool " DVD case . This movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college . i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television ... at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
0 Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard - earned dollars . Suggestion ? Keep your hard - earned dollars and let 's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one . Guess what the plots about ? Zombies taking over . This time though , for the sake of originality ( ? ) this film takes place in Rhode Island , and to be honest I 'm not sure I 've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island . A TV station , controlled by the government , is supposedly keeping up " normal " broadcasts so that any remaining citizens wo n't think that there 's any problem in the world , that is , those that never look or go outside , anyway . I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film . There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I 'm not bothering with that because after a while you 'll either not care or have fallen asleep . At any rate , this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the " seen it all before " stuff that gets trotted out before the camera . Trust me , you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this . 3 out of 10 .
0 Set in Providence , Rhode Island , Feeding the Masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government . At best , it could be applied to how the US try to control media during the Iraq War , but it ends up feeling hollow . There 's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good . Worst , the direction of the movie is atrocious , focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond " Is n't this an odd way to hold the camera . " Special effects are pretty bad ... at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city , and it 's laughable at best.<br /><br />The film does have a couple bright spots ... namely the advertisements for post - zombie services ( including a reclamation service and a party bus ) . But it 's far too little to make the film worthwhile.<br /><br />For a better zombie film , try Hide and Creep . It has the same weak production value , but there 's much more wit , humor and talent behind it .
0 Honestly , who in God 's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating ? ? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted . Otherwise this movie sucks ! This movie is nothing more than an amateur , or possibly student , film . I 'm a movie fanatic , and have seen terrible movies , but there was literally nothing redeeming here . The story and acting was the worst I 've ever seen . The props , including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects , where just as bad as everything else . I 'm all for bad language in movies , but the F - Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F - Bomb in any movie EVER . The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film . I 'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country , but it does n't belong on a DVD.<br /><br />Do not buy this movie . Do not rent this movie . All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon . This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back . Unfortunately for me , that time is lost , but it 's not too late for you . If you decide to rent this movie , consider this my warning .
0 This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the misfortune to see . Terrible , terrible , terrible . Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker , the filmmakers family , or a friend of the filmmaker . How does this film suck ? Let us count the ways ... <br /><br />The plot ? Incoherent . Dialogue ? Atrocious . I will not slam the effects / gore , as I understand that this is low budget . But was there even one zombie that was not obese ? C'mon ! And for a film set in Rhode Island , why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate ? Continuity , find some.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier " Stands at attention " . Please , do n't put your ex - girlfriend or buddy 's sister in your movie naked . This was an ugly movie filled with ugly people , and has no business even mentioning Romero on the cover . Next time you decide to make a movie , do n't .
0 This apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking ; but FEEDING THE MASSES comes off lame as some of the stiff - legged zombies stalking the streets . In Rhode Island , a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus Virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations . A couple of brave , but dumb , souls at Channel 5 TV News feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand . An eager reporter(Racheal Morris)and her cameraman(William Garberina ) , with the aid of a military escort(Patrick Cohen ) , risk life and limb to present a ' live ' broadcast to show the doom at hand . Do yourself a favor and do n't watch . This thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad . Acting is atrocious and the flesh - hungry zombies are almost comical . Also appearing are : Michael Propster , William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan . FEEDING THE MASSES should be left to starve .
0 As you may have gathered from the title , I wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time . The acting , camera - work , writing , special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked . People have argued that while this movie is terribly - acted and terribly - produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script . Wow . The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count . For starters , why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it 's not safe ? I know the government 's supposed to be evil but they do n't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country . There would n't be anyone to govern ! Another thing that I was wondering about , even if the government told everyone to go to work , why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies ? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet ? And how about the ending ? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies . He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature . And another thing , why does he say Hindenburg before he dies . The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people . The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country , possibly the world . He does n't think anyone else will get a few snapshots ? They also managed to ruin the only semi - interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer . Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl ? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR . It 's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself would n't understand . Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses.<br /><br />Anywho , I think it 's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production . Hey Trent Haaga , I 'm calling you out !
0 Although nothing can compare to Vampires Vs . Zombies ... in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie.<br /><br />Firstly , the special effects were breath - taking . When there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode , and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me . Simply stunning my friends.<br /><br />But the scene when the Jack Black sound - a - like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself , but do n't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on " I must be high " . Seriously , he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non - congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be " high " to justify his awful acting . Well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers , directors , executive producers , sponsors you will probably get the same response ... seriously.<br /><br />With a production team called " Shock - o - rama " i was shocked i did n't place a sawed - off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played.<br /><br />If you want to see this movie , then you should be murdered < br /><br />Yours Truly,<br /><br />The General
0 First , a little summary . This reporter named Torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him . Nice message , government censorship and all that , but the way they DID the movie was , well let me explain.<br /><br />This movie is beyond description . The idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by George Romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution . The script is atrocious on its own , like it was written by a sixth grader . As for special effects , I understand that independent films have low budgets , and some gore effects looked acceptable , but if you want a scene with fire , here 's a tip : buy some nonflammable material , have an extinguisher ready , and get a fire going ! Do n't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game . The acting , well let 's put it this way . In my summer theater program , a cold reading of the script is , compared to this , The Godfather . I wo n't even go into the inconsistencies . Find them yourself.<br /><br />What disturbed me the most , though , was when everything was finished after shooting and editing , somebody might have said , " Okay , this looks good . Let 's release it . " It sends a chill down my spine to even think about it , to think somebody felt that this was good enough for DVD release . This is n't DVD quality . This is n't Sci - Fi channel quality . Hell , this is n't even film school quality . If you were to submit this in for a project at a film school , you would get an F. No , not even an F , more like an F- . I would n't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled.<br /><br />I felt used after I saw this thing . Blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now , and I 'd prefer not to think of what they 're doing with it . I have been the pawn of some elaborate , nefarious scheme at legalized theft , and it does n't feel good to think that I walked right into it , looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 Days Later only to find a film Ed Wood would watch and say afterwards , " I did n't much care for this . " This film is the single most terrible movie I have seen . I have not seen anything by Ed Wood , but I have confidence this is worse . If you are looking for serious cinema , so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache . If not , I still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night . However , if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then I recommend you check this out . You wo n't be disappointed .
0 Please , for the love of God , do n't watch it . Now saying that , I know what you 're thinking , it ca n't be that bad can it ? If everyone says it as bad as they say , I have to watch it ! Do n't do it ! It 'll be like looking at a horrible accident involving little babies and a gasoline tanker ! You 'll be scarred for life ... the image will never leave you ! I could only watch a half hour of this before becoming violently sick . The acting is the worst I 've ever seen , and I 've seen Barbwire ! ! ! If you do risk ripping your eyes out and rent this movie ... don't say I have n't warned you ! The cover and storyline are a trap ! ! Zombies ? Satire ? Shaun of the Dead was great ! This movie must be the same .... right ? NO ! ! The writing = crap directing = garbage acting = there was no acting . Still not convinced ? Then forever your soul will be tormented ! ! !
0 ... because 99 out of 100 times , the producers lied through their teeth ( or someone else 's ) to get you to rent or buy their * mercifully censored*.<br /><br />Shock - O - Rama Cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of " Feeding the Masses , " a possibly well - intentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre . Folks , this is not only low - budget film - making , this is VERY low - budget film - making by a bunch of people who -- I'm sorry , I know they have families who love them -- will never , ever be in Variety in any significant fashion . This is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin ' pitcher , folks , and not just because it 's cheap.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre , but I do n't blame the actors ; they had no direction . They had no direction because the script was a half - baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling . Characterization is thin at best , no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction . Have I mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame ? They are . There 's no drama , no tension , no great character moments , nothing . The whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric " commercial breaks " and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish . Syd Fields would not be pleased.<br /><br />How could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere ? Why would they give it more than a cursory try ? In this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access , what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best ? Now , if they were covering something up , like their own culpability .... but " Feeding the Masses " never explores such possibilities . Instead , it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and/or significance , praying its audience wo n't notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film - making equipment . Did anyone in this film get paid ? I hope the actors did , if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one ; at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience.<br /><br />Even zombie fans will find little to gain from " Feeding the Masses . " The gore is remarkably tame for no - budgeters of its rank , and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects . They 're all eminently forgettable , in fact . KNB has nothing to fear.<br /><br />Even junk like the Aussie stillbirth " Undead " was miles ahead of " Feeding the Masses . " Sorry , guys , back to the drawing boards , and take your deceptive marketing with you .
0 Mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the 90 ' mark . The beautiful sets are here with all that made the Hamer production values a trademark , yet Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect . The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5 % of your attention to be expected.<br /><br />The directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play , actors are mostly stiff as wax figures ( ok this is a Hamer feature , only it 's sometimes better featured in the whole package ) . My conclusion : this movie is trash , not worth the time I spend that evening . Eternal life is a boring matter and I should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the Cinemathèque would have known better .
0 I remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it . I guess I was a bit too old to get all excited and I was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy.<br /><br />In the early 90 's we were swamped with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 Ninjas . I think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone.<br /><br />Many kids movies have some big point they 're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message , this one does n't have any message at all ... it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes.<br /><br />The movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to ? The acting is pretty bad . Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here .. The short , fat , gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious . The kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was maybe the worst kid actor I have ever seen.<br /><br />The movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review . 3 ninjas ... yea you know they 're gon na fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously ... Need I say more . Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone.<br /><br />With all that said KIDS WILL LOVE IT . This movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it . If you do n't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see . If you do n't mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts , real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids ... I say kids because I think even the girls will like it ... I recall all the girls having a crush on Rocky.<br /><br />2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults .. this movie failed big time at that .. It is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and I would not allow a child of mine to watch it ... Kung Fu the TV series is on DVD and there 's tons of great Shaw Brothers films out there ... Why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way , perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 Ninjas ... no no no ... never kick a man between the legs ... never .. that s so unninja like .
0 Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot . You could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene . Oh , and the acting sucks too . Although I must say that the line : " Sorry , dude , I have to take a major dump big time " made me laugh my ass off .
0 Oh my god ! This movie insults the intelligence of everybody . I mean really , who thinks three kids can fight 30 to 40 ninjas and win . Not to mention the brainless humor thrown in . This film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad . The movie is an omen , the only thing it 's good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs .
0 I saw this movie on t.v . this afternoon and I ca n't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash . It 's not funny at all and it takes your I.Q. down a few notches . I know this movie is for kids , but that does n't mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted . I bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a ) The word " poop " equals big laugh . b ) A four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net . c ) Kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d ) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so - called " ninjas " with swords . One good thing I can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban " gang " in the world that could n't scare anybody . Maybe the guys at MST3 K could use this movie for a good laugh . Do n't bother with this lame - ass excuse for a movie .
0 Although it has been 2 years , I still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie . Unfortunately , I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it while browsing through the new releases at Blockbuster . We decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable . Although it has been quite some time since I viewed the movie , I still remember the lack of plot ( seriously , there is no true plot ) , and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie . If you are in the video store and this film catches your eye , walk on and find a better movie . If you did end up seeing this movie , I understand your pain :)
0 On the face of it , this should be a great film , a great cast , a plot with many possibilities and one of Hollywood 's finest behind the camera for the first time.<br /><br />However , its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again . This movie fails on so many levels . In a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations , it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director . Not so here , the great cast is horribly under - used , none more so than the great , late John Spencer , the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you have n't seen in a hundred other TV movies . There is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists . At least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in Hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
0 by Dane Youssef < br /><br />A gang of crooks . The perfect plan . It all goes wrong . They 're in trouble . The police are outside . They 're cornered . What are they gon na do now?<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />The movie seems like it 's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop , the " indie " film and the theater.<br /><br />It 's the kind of things that actors love -- it 's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting ... acting angry , tense , scared , conversing , scheming , planning -- giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.<br /><br />A trio of crooks , one leader , one goon , one brother , come up with a big heist scheme ... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works . To top things off , there 's a bit of a " fender - bender " and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.<br /><br />The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically ( and leadenly ) " Dino 's Last Chance." < br /><br />Spacey , as a director , tries to keep the focus on the actors ' performances and delivery of dialouge . He pans over to a bright passion - red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart . And he keeps all the violence off - screen , really.<br /><br />I think that was a mistake . Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role . Matt Dillon ( " Drugstore Cowboy " and " Wild Things " ) seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.<br /><br />Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag - along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul - swearing mad - dog police lieutenant who 's all thumbs , but he is n't given anything to really do here.<br /><br />William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.<br /><br />And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.<br /><br />Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going . The characters are mostly chatting away , trying to think of a plan ... and they 're to calm and too articulate . There 's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside , ready to strike . At one point , one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar . Oh brother . Oh bother.<br /><br />These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up . Should n't the holed - up crooks be a little scared , a little uneasy ? Meanwhile , all the real action is happening inside.<br /><br />Someone whips out a gun , a baseball bat , which leads to an ugly confrontation off - screen and there 's one more casualty that happens that 's ... well , kinda sad . But ... <br /><br />Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach , improving on her New Orleans accent . Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part.<br /><br />A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look . And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield . < br /><br />The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it 's as profane , but never as realistic or as insightful.<br /><br />The movie feels like too much of what it really is ... a really low - budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that 's " not bad , but needs a few more re - writes . " Spacey shows he 's not a terrible director , but he lacks a sort of feel for " shaping a movie " and it feels like he 's just filming actors act.<br /><br />These actors are all talented and could work with the material , but they all feel out of place . As I said before , the movie really suffers from miscasting . < br /><br />I do n't mean that the wrong actors were cast . I think they found just the right cast , but placed them in all the wrong roles . I think switching some of the roles would 've helped immensely.<br /><br />Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack , Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops , keeping Fischter in his " bloodthirsty goon " part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb . That would have been a big improvement.<br /><br />When some actors direct , it works . They can even win Oscars for it . But a lot of the time , when actors direct , they have a tendency to just focus on the performances . Just shoot the actors acting.<br /><br />Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for it . An excuse for it.<br /><br />Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming - of - age stories so it 's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well.<br /><br />There are a few really great entries into this genre . ' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations : " The Negotiator." < br /><br />This certainly wo n't become a cult classic , let alone one of AFI 's 100 . Still , it does have a few nice moments and personal touches , but in the end , it 's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV . It 's just not worth going out of your way to see.<br /><br />I give a 3 out of 10 . < br /><br />Spacey 's other directorial credit , " Beyond The Sea " was reportedly a better effort . Hmmm ... maybe it 's true . You need to fail before you succeed.<br /><br />by Dane Youssef
0 A trio of low - life criminals , led by Matt Dillon , botches a late - night burglary . They flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist . Of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist , the real terrorist gets away , and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar , taking hostages , unaware why the police are so intent on catching them . And guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night?<br /><br />Unbelievable ? Absolutely . And it goes down hill from there . Spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent ; Matt Dillon , Faye Dunaway , Gary Sinise , Viggo Mortensen , and M. Emmett Walsh , but they 're all wasted . Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar , all they do for the remainder of the film is argue . Endlessly and aimlessly . Long before the conclusion of the film you 've stopped giving a damn about what happens to them .
0 Kevin Spacey is very talented , but unfortunately directing is not his forte . I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much . I admire Spacey 's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting , but it 's not the attempt that counts . I found the film dull , boring , and stretched out . The acting was nothing spectacular . Gary Sinise has done much better , especially since he is conscious in most of his other films . Skeet Ulrich was disappointing , but this was one of his first films ( I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked ) . The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above . The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck . However , that shot was very " Usual Suspects"ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his ( which is very good mind you ) . If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting , watch Hitchcock 's Lifeboat . Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this .
0 Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi ( Burial Ground ) and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci . Now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest . This could not be further from that . Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema . I was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had that problem with Italian horror films.<br /><br />Massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax . This scene was used in Fulci 's Nightmare Concert . This is n't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter . Unfortuanitly , the next hour of the movie is SO boring . The movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away . The last 30 minutes of the movie are n't so bad but still could have been much better . The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here . The end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor.<br /><br />This was n't a very good film but for a true Italian horror freak ( like myself ) this movie is a must have since it is very rare . 4/10 stars
0 Prior to this film , I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi : the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore ( 1981 ) , famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man - child Peter Bark , and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer . Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema , but both were entertaining in their own special way ( and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity did n't hurt ) . Massacre , however , is dull , dull , dull , despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.<br /><br />The story , about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot , is confusing and oh - so boring : when the blood is n't flowing and the skin is n't on show , the film is a real struggle to sit through ( it took me four attempts to finish ) , with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.<br /><br />The only point of interest about the film is that its producer , Lucio Fulci , used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega - gory movie Cat In The Brain ( AKA Nightmare Concert ) . And if you 've already seen that film , then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre .
0 In case half of this film 's footage looks strangely familiar , it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult - crap ! For you see , the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie , he also took the liberty of re - using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own ( and more easily traceable ) " Cat in the Brain " . The opening scene already , in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe , features in Fulci 's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments . Andrea Bianchi 's " Masssacre " fails miserably as a giallo , since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie - crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful , but it 's still good entertainment if you 're into cheap ' n shlocky horror trash . The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who 're all potential maniacs , but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately . Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make - up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast . Whenever there is n't any bloodshed on screen , like between the first and second murder , " Massacre " is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography . Thankfully in the second half , there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes . The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative . My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned " Cat in the Brain " . That one features ALL the great moments of " Massacre " , and then some .
0 Sorry Fulci fans , but I could not get through this one . The soundtrack was about as annoying as they come , the acting was puerile , the story has been done and done , and the direction was non - existent . < br /><br />Massacre honestly looked like a children 's film project . But I 've seen some of those , and they actually look better than this did ! It appears to have been so underfunded they could n't afford ... ANYTHING ! Not a DoP , not a director , no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was . It was a very poor cinematic experience ; one of my worst.<br /><br />This was about the worst suck - fest I 've seen , next to Terror Toons which is second only to Killer Klowns from Outer Space . I 've nothing else to say about it.<br /><br />It rates a 0.1/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband . Is this the only role she knows how to play ? This time it 's set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man . I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable . Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk . I would n't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well . I would n't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie . Then after some milk throwing , she says sorry and sees the blouse man again . Duh . Then while she is making it with him , her son gets stung by wasps . My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest . This kids mom did n't have time to tell him that , she was too busy with the blouse man .
0 Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others ? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon - landing with the Titanic sinking and you 've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low - life trash . Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do ? " I 'll show those old meanies , I 'll put out my own movie and prove that you do n't have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money ! " Yeah , we already know that . The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking . The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane , I 'm running the other way . It 's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids . It 's audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969 .
0 Any movie that portrays the hard - working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored , cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era.<br /><br />It 's little wonder that this movie was written by a woman .
0 Recently , I had opportunity to view a working print in Kansas City ( Olathe , KS . ) of this title . It is difficult for me , being a lover of the art as I am , to report the following , but , the truth sometimes hurts , and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe ( I 'm using the slang definition here - worthless statements or writing ) for an hour and a half , I feel obligated to share ( WARN ) any interested parties . Let 's begin at the beginning , a good place to start as always . The first 15 minutes are not really that bad , a couple of laughs , and decent development , but then it is downhill from there . This is the story of a woman , in her mid thirties , that ( as the writer would like for you to believe ) is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled . The first major difficulty occurs when if you do n't know that fact going into the movie , you wo n't know it when she suddenly risks it all for , in my opinion , a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman . There is little development ( drastically insufficient development ) to justify her actions for the affair she has , and when it occurs , one feels , as I did , that she is just of low moral character . The word " slut " comes to mind , hopefully , they 'll let that pass the review and post the comment . This , in my opinion , is the first fatal flaw of the film . If you 're married or have ever been in love , irregardless of whether you are male or female , its going to turn you off . Quite frankly , I feel that it would have made a much better " blue movie " - that 's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving . The second fatal flaw is the casting , Diane Lane just did n't work for me here , and Viggo Mortensen is not the right man for the job , believe me . The only saving grace to the entire film is Anna Paquin , the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places , conveying a subtle yet very blunt ( I apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate ) portrayal of an emerging teen . Bravo , well done . I 'm not going to give the ending away , but I was disappointed , being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing ... but an ending like that .... Well , if that teased you enough to see this picture , do n't say I did n't warn you , but you better look fast - if this celluloid is released , I doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames . I 'd say wait for the video , but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value . Hmmm , Dustin Hoffman produced this , you think he 'd learn after Ishtar . This film once carried the working title " Blouse Man " and should have been left on the rack . If you 've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film , give this one 35 - 40 minutes , the only thing worth staying for is Anna Paquin , if you can stomach the fact that you 'll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home , which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you 're off to the movies to see this one . That 's my two cents , for what it is worth .
0 Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast A WALK ON THE MOON a movie I had absolutely no knowledge off < br /><br />I missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea Viggo Mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap TVM , certainly the opening with the mawkish Pearl and Marty taking their kids to a Summer camp has that sort of made for TV feel though the brightly lit ( Too brightly lit ) cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn`t until the appearence of Viggo Mortensen as hippy guy Walker that I realised this was a cinema release , after all someone of Mortensen`s stature wouldn`t star in a TVM , I mean that`s like a legend like Robert DeNiro appearing in a straight to video film . Wait a minute , didn`t Bob .... ? < br /><br />Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are an unconvincing on - screen couple and I agree . I can understand why Pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why Walker would be attracted to plain house wife Pearl . The sixties was before my time but surely if you`ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it`s not really a choice at all . Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those days so I guess that explains it < br /><br />I feel the major problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes down to the fact it`s a romantic drama at heart ( Just like you`d expect in a TVM ) with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene ? It jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 . I say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and Woodstock . In other words A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
0 Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing . " A Walk on the Moon " appears to have borrowed from other , better made films . The present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock . The screen treatment by Pamela Gray does n't have much going for it , so it 's a puzzle why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction.<br /><br />The Kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort . We see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home . Marty , the father , comes only for the week - end ; he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets , mostly . In a few days the first man will walk in space , so the excitement is evident.<br /><br />The Kantrowitz women are left behind . Pearl , Marty 's wife and her mother - in - law , Lilian , spend idle days in the place until the " blouse salesman " arrives . Pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte ; she gets the salesman as well . It appears that Pearl and Marty have no sexual life at all . After two children , Pearl , who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun.<br /><br />That is the basic premise for the film , which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter , Alison , decides to play hooky and go to the Woodstock festival nearby where , horror of horrors , she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman ! What 's a girl to do ? Well , stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son 's bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy , and daddy is called from the city , after knowing about Pearl 's betrayal with the younger stud.<br /><br />Poor Diane Lane , she went to make " Unfaithful " later on , which is the upscale version of this dud . Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears ! Liev Schreiber as Marty , the cuckolded husband , does n't have much to do . Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana , who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard!<br /><br />Watch it at your risk , or pop the DVD in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh , or two dishing the film .
0 In what could have been an otherwise run of the mill , mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties ( the subtle " free - love " period ) , the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top , happily ever after ending . At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their troublesome middle - class care free life , nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber . The story line plods along slowly to its predictable , pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless . Here 's a hint , it occurs about 30 minutes into the film . Fast forward to that part and skip the rest .
0 Previous commentator Steve Richmond stated that A Walk On The Moon is , in his words " not worth your $ 7 " . I ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst - quality DVDs I have yet seen , of this film or any film in existence . Even when you ignore the fact that the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion , the film has no redeeming qualities ( save Anna 's presence ) to make watching a top quality Blu - Ray transfer worthwhile . Not that this is any fault of the other actors . Liev Schreiber , Diane Lane , Tovah Feldshuh , and Viggo Mortensen all score high on the relative to Anna Paquin acting ability chart . Far more so than Holly Hunter or Sam Neill did in spite of an equally lousy script , anyway . Director Tony Goldwyn 's resume is nothing to crow about , but Pamela Gray 's resume includes Wes Craven 's most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre , so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction.<br /><br />As I have indicated already , the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin . In her acting debut , she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years ' experience above hers under the table . While she is not as far ahead of her castmates here , her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her Oscar was no fluke . For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel , and a dialogue seventy - three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why . This woman could literally act the paint off walls . Anna aside , only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience . Sure , his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis , but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly . I should know , even if it is not from the same circumstances here.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman , although perhaps not to the same extent . In a manner of speaking , he is the villain of the piece , but he successfully gives the character a third dimension . Yes , his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded , but not many men would act any differently in his situation . Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed - up situation , so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here . Unfortunately , these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist . Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it . Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility.<br /><br />That said , the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it . Mason Daring 's original music , while not standing out in any way , gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not . Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor , putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake . He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinny - dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall , it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn . The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story . No matter how many times I rewatch Liev 's scenes , I can not help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing . One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful , but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way.<br /><br />Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen , he thought her character was where the real story lay . Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen , to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earth - shattering as the moon landing will not help . In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character 's story is presented , Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes . While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast , it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber . Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere . Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong.<br /><br />I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten . Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances ( and that is saying something ) .
0 In 1972 , after his wife left to go her own way , Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson . Miss Thompson , a good - humored , long haired , lovely , statuesque beauty queen , is charted to fill a void in Elvis ' life . When Elvis ' divorce became final , Linda was already in place as the legendary performer 's live - in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976.<br /><br />This is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship . Linda whole - heartedly tending to her lover 's needs and desires . And even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium . At times this movie is harsh and dark of heart ; a very unattractive look at the ' King ' and his queen.<br /><br />Don Johnson is absolutely awful as Elvis . Over acting to the hilt is not attractive . Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda , but does the job pretty well . Supporting cast includes : John Crawford , Ruta Lee , and Rick Lenz . Watching this twice is more than enough for me , but do n't let this review stop you from checking it out . For most Elvis fans that I have conferred with , this is not a favored presentation .
0 You may say to yourself , " Don Johnson as Elvis ? Can that work ? Is it possible ? Seems like an terrible choice to me , but perhaps I should have an open mind . Maybe I 'll be surprised . Maybe he can pull it off." < br /><br />NOT!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not a bad actor . But he is an awful Elvis . He 's too short , too weak - voiced , too sharply featured ... well you 've already imagined how bad he would be . Add to that a hokey black wig and heavy - handed eye - liner and mascara and it 's a big fat embarrassing mess.<br /><br />The best I can say is that since Johnson 's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off , after a while you do n't even think of him as Elvis anymore . You see him as some other crazed pop star instead . Then , on that level , the movie becomes watchable.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall , beauty queen , Linda Thompson . But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty , elegance and intelligence we 've come to expect from all her roles . There may be too much intelligence in her performance . You have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope.<br /><br />There 's nothing new to this story ; we 've heard it many times before . If you 've looking for new info or insight , you wo n't find it . It 's told as a love story - an unrequited one : Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs .
0 I 'm a Don Johnson fan , but this is undoubtedly the WORST movie , done by anybody , that I 've ever seen . The acting was bad , as was the cinematography . Don should stick to doing action , because as The King , he just did n't cut it .
0 I 've been working my way through a collection of Lugosi films recently , and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of Lugosi and Boris Karloff in " The Black Cat " I was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in " The Raven . " Alas , it just did n't work for me , and by the end of the film I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />For the first three quarters of this movie or so I thought the story lacked any real suspense . Lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad Dr. Vollins , some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman ( Irene Ware ) he treats after a car accident but who ca n't have her - partly because she 's already engaged , and partly because her father ( Samuel S. Hinds ) disapproves . To deal with that situation , he enlists the aid of Edmond Bateman ( Boris Karloff ) - a horribly ugly man who wants Vollins to make him look more acceptable . Aside from Lugosi 's performance , though , I found little to hold my interest . Then , suddenly , in the last fifteen or twenty minutes , the movie shifts around completely . Suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful , but I thought Lugosi 's performance fell apart , largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane - and there 's a difference . He plays the " mad " role very well - controlled and in control but evil . " Insane " is a more out of control evil , and I did n't think Lugosi pulled that off well . At one point , he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake . In the meantime , Karloff was a huge disappointment . He never grabbed me at all . As an aside , it must have grated on Lugosi that - in movies in which they co - star - Karloff gets the top billing , even though in " The Raven " it 's clearly Lugosi who is the lead actor . This surely gives a hint as to how Universal ranked their two great horror stars - inexplicably , I would add , because I 've always thought of Lugosi as the better actor of the two.<br /><br />In any event , there 's no real connection here to Edgar Allen Poe 's story " The Raven " - except that Vollins is a Poe fanatic , who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from Poe 's stories . Overall , a disappointment . 4/10 .
0 The strange people living in a town go about their lives . There 's the licker a guy who licks everything , a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him , a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her , a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways ... offbeat in the extreme , this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color . The monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel . Like a Troma movie , this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time - not always- but enough for it not to be fun.(Though I did n't see the cleansing coming ) . Worth a shot if you 've nothing else to watch and you 're waiting for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix .
0 Townies is the laziest movie I have ever seen , and I saw the Blair Witch movies ( parts one and two ) . It seems confused in what it wants to be . It 's not funny enough for comedy , it 's not tragic enough for drama , it 's not bloody enough for horror , and it 's not good enough for watching . It has scenes of a man doing " slapstick / bloody " karate so I think , oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash . Then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl , a retarded ( mentally handicap ) woman and a trusting mother . Then it slaps itself into the ONLY good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks . The part I 'm speaking of is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse . That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling . The rest was a waist of my life . Then , just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of the film of Wayne ( the Director ) making fun of Toby ( the star ) in public . It made me sick . Even though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd ( two other movies by Wayne ) are n't the best , they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits . I even like Killer Nerd a bit , it had some great lines I still use to this day.<br /><br />If you like underground films , if you like overground films , and if you like to watch your feet , just resting were they are , you will not like TOWNIES!<br /><br />*1/2 ( out of * * * * ) < br /><br / >
0 I ca n't believe I wasted my time with this movie . I could n't even call it a movie . It was so bad with nothing to recommend it . < br /><br />I like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death . Badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious . You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie . I wonder what I was thinking watching it to the end . I recommend this movie to no one . How did they release this ? Was there an audience who likes this kind of movie ? There must be because you can find this at almost any video store . But why?<br /><br />Deserves to be forgotten.<br /><br />If you like bad movies then this is for you .
0 Written by a woman , and directed by another . Whoppie . Are we in for a feminist ride or what . Fasten your seat - belts , ladies , for we are about to enter a world of mean men and innocent , well - intentioned women.<br /><br />In this soaper Trish comes across a guy in the employment agency who behaves , looks , and dresses like a pimp ( ! ) and gives her a job with the hope of nailing her some time later . In his office he even touches her chin the way a megalomaniacal heavy in a Bond movie would a touch a girl just after he 's captured her and just before he is ready to kill her alongside with Bond . Some time later the pimp / employment guy stalks Trish in a ladies ' dressing - room , harasses her , and even comes close to raping her . Oh , these evil , evil men . They are ALL bad , do n't you know . You ca n't even look for a job nowadays without getting raped , right ladies ? Well , we 'll show 'em ! In this film there is some kind of a divorced women 's club or something , headed by a Janet Leigh who speaks for all women involved in this film when she says that " men are all s**t " . She moans about how terrible men are ; she has been divorced five times . Now , seriously : any woman who marries twenty times and then uses that statistic as an argument that men are all " bad " must have realized eventually that the explanation might lie elsewhere , or ? It must occur to her that : a ) she is a bad judge of male character , or - much more likely - b ) SHE is the one impossible to live with - her ex - husbands were probably the victims , or if they were indeed a**holes then she probably got what she deserved . ( Do n't the likes of Zsa - Zsa Gabor and Liz Taylor prove this point ? Show me a likable woman who got married this often and I 'll show you a way to reach the planet Mars using only roller - skates and a ladder . ) Trish eventually meets a computer guy who restores her faith in men - but hold your horses ; this guy turns out to be married , therefore proving WITHOUT a doubt that men are indeed all " bad " . Were it not , of course , for a kindly old vegetable seller around the corner who loves his wife even though she 's still dead - proving that all men are " bad " except for kindly old men whose penises do n't work and they " ca n't get none " anyway so they are forced to abandon a life of a**holocolism and finally give women the respect they deserve . Even the supporting male characters are all " bad " ; the black guy in the employment agency is unfriendly , and the guy in the mortuary is out - right rude - and insensitive ( the bastard , * sob* ... *sniffle *  ) And what 's with this corny , corny ending ? ... Minutes before court - time Trish abandons the claim to any of her husband 's money , realizing that she is now " free " and that she can finally do that jump into the swimming pool ... ? ? What 's all that about ? ? Her jump into the pool is then - very predictably - frame - frozen as the credits start to role in , while life - inspiring I - don't - need - revenge - nor - my - husband's - money music starts kicking in . Her girlfriends are shocked by her abandonment of money claims , but they do n't stay shocked for long and soon start kidding each other about what a heart - attack Trish 's lawyer will get when he hears about this . The shyster lawyer is naturally a man . An evil , evil , terrible " bad " man , whose only interest in this world is money ... Ah , these men ; all they care about is money ; they know nothing of the higher values in life - like shopping . I am glad we have movies like this ; they bring the sexes closer together , but most importantly , they teach girls and young women that men are all horny , selfish , skirt - chasing bastards who will dump you into a world of poverty and misery the first chance they get . So , girls , open your mouths an stick your tongues into your girlfriend 's mouths . Lesbian power !
0 What is most striking about this semi - musical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing . It 's top of the line from First National in these departments . The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Miller 's other two films ( SUNNY , SALLY ) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval , complications and final clinch . All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy . Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU . There are also DON'T EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE.<br /><br />Miller here is very engaging and delightful , quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery . Sad she does not dance as that is her forte . SALLY remains her finest film , with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up . Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable . It 's worth visiting these films though to see Ziegfeld 's top star of the twenties .
0 John Boorman 's 1998 The General was hailed as a major comeback , though it 's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself . One of three films made that year about famed Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill ( alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles ) , it has an abundance of incident and style ( the film was shot in colour but released in b&w Scope in some territories ) but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever . With a main character who threatens witnesses , car bombs doctors , causes a hundred people to lose their jobs , tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister , it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film . It does n't get it . Instead , it 's lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleeson 's worst and most disinterested performance : he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there 's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character . On the plus side , this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug , but it 's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics.<br /><br />There 's a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the ' General ' and his men , painting them as ' anti - social ' drug dealers purely because Cahill wo n't share his loot from a robbery with them , but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot - something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we 're expected to find lovably cheeky - that it 's just thrown away . Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart , but by then it 's too late to really care . Adrian Dunbar , Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles , but Jon Voight 's hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance , overcompensating for Gleeson 's comatose non - involvement in what feels like a total misfire . Come back Zardoz , all is forgiven .
0 Just had to write that one liner , but it really is . I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I 've seen in recent years . I have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one , the script . It is a weak story about a petty criminal . No amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance . I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he 's gon na do another film about the general . My advice is do n't waste your time .
0 Like with any movie genre , there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies . If you asked me to name a good gangster movie , I 'd have dozens to choose from . If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie , probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you , the last time . That film is " The General " , unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name . This is a very dry , very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story ( it 's more than easy to follow ) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.<br /><br />Like " Goodfellas " ( 1990 ) and " American Gangster " ( 2007)two superior mob movies"The General " is based on real people and true events . The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill ( Brendan Gleeson ) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult . Meanwhile , the police led by an inspector named Kenny ( Jon Voight ) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict ( or kill ) him.<br /><br />Perhaps because it 's a film in the same category as the marvelous " Goodfellas " ( 1990 ) and the first two " Godfather " films , I was expecting too much from " The General . " But that may be going too easy on it . This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far - too - stretched running time of screaming bad scenes . Let 's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented . For some reason , director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black - and - white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full - fledged color film . Now I have nothing against b / w pictures , not even ones made in modern - day times . " Schindler 's List " ( 1993 ) was more than ninety percent filmed in black - and - white and it 's a masterpiece . " The General " , made just five years after " Schindler 's List " is not . The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video - game - like quality that I found simply annoying . The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist 's documentary - like style , like " Schindler 's List " did , but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time , too much like a classic - style motion picture . Performances in the film range from passable to poor . Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles , but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting . The sound design is also very primitive , probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime - noir appeal , but that also fails because again , it 's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.<br /><br />But the worst thing that occurs is that there 's not onenot onecharacter in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for . In fact , for every moment of every scene , the only thought going through my head was " okay  so what ? " Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time - consuming here . I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull . Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did . If a character is killed off ( as they always are in gangster films ) , we feel nothing . No remorse , no relief , no surprise , nothing . We just say " so what ? " And that 's all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy , very poorly - made crime film .
0 A craven , cowardly film . Director Boorman shows Cahill burglarizing rich houses , but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny , that s all right then . The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is blown up in his car , but he is rat faced sourpuss , and does n't look like a nice man , so that s all right too . The Beits , owner of Russborrough House , made their money by exploiting ' darkies ' digging up diamonds , so it 's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains . The Garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder . The moral equivalencing is sickening , Boorman looks for a hit film , but does n't have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang , who terrorized the neighbourhood , and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon Dublin . He even liaised with the Generals son while making it . Disgusting . Shame on him for his cowardice .
0 This was a disappointing film . The people seem to have no substance , the lead protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redemptive values , in fact everyone in it including Jon Voight epitomizes sleeze . I would not recommend this film to anyone . The violence is distasteful , though artfully done . The filming is to black , at least the print i saw fit this category . A disappointment .
0 Bill Maher 's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion . It 's an attack on Christianity and Islam . Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations , he really does n't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel . If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion , he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called ' holy books ' of organized religion . This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent . Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return ? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they 're stupid . What makes him the " rational " person in the room ? In a way it reflects how he really is n't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization , watch Richard Dawkins ' ' Root of All Evil ? ' . It is a brilliantly researched documentary , clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher 's Religulous is not funny , poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic . It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing . I almost feel sorry for him .
0 Some funny bits , but come Bill ! A film ? Quoting Zeitgeist ? Keep the TV Show and the interviews , but a film ? I 'm probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film ... I do n't know . I laughed , disagreed , agreed ... this film is very confusing and inconsistent.<br /><br />Bill 's a funny guy ... but also very cocky ... Bill 's rhetoric is similar to Bill Hicks , a brilliant comedian . But like many comedians , the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying . I think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility . This might be just a personal taste , but comedy that constantly demeans somebody can not be taken as truth . Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism . I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible , but the response to it can not be sensible . It will create unnecessary turmoil . We can do better than just react to fundamentalism . His conclusion is that " we do n't know " and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything , to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion . His humility that he only knows that he does n't , is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non - sense.<br /><br />I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist , the movie in Bill 's film . All the astrotheology - influenced non - sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing . Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship . It is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources . Astro - mystic sources that reduce everything to " the stars say it all " seem to be from the Middle Ages . This film is a confusing statement from a confused " agnostic " . Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as " we do n't know".<br /><br />This film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.<br /><br />Watch the film ( it has hilarious interviews and bits ) but PLEASE do not behave like Bill . You can not expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line . His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting , provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation .. There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues .
0 This film is really ONLY Bill Maher 's interpretation of religion . There are several funny moments , and some interesting points , but do n't go into this expecting an even - handed discussion of religion . This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director , rather than letting you make your own decision.<br /><br />EDITING - It 's very chopped up , inter - spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point . The interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing . The only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say . Once someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher , they get edited.<br /><br />INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions . From the TV evangelical to the ultimate Jewish stereotype , to a TRUCK STOP chapel ( Seriously . A TRUCK STOP CHAPEL ) . He 's picked the worst money - grabbers , the heavy extremists , and those who do n't have the budget to say no to pick on . And when he does get a good person to interview , he edits the hell out of them.<br /><br />STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes . Especially hard hit are the Muslims . During the Muslim segment , he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself , or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers . ALL Muslims are portrayed as gun - toting extremists through the editing , and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly.<br /><br />ENDING - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy - handed , and while it is an interesting idea , it 's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists . Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground . This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous , and that it will destroy the world . He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid.<br /><br />With the faults to the film , it has some good points , and the humor , while very unfair , is actually funny . But know going in , it is a very one - sided view , Bill Maher 's view , of religion . He 's not discovering anything . He 's telling you what he thinks.<br /><br />4/10 - Some good moments , but heavy - handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style .
0 I saw it , I agree with him 100 % , but I did n't care for his delivery . He just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited , contrived juvenile smear campaign . Edit cuts galore , etc ... The camera would be focused on him , and you 'd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog . Add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot , which is a film no - no.<br /><br />This documentary hits a topic with so many angles , so many interesting stories , that the movie is just so easily done . Picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid . It is so easy it is just wrong . I mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags ? To make them contradict themselves , you just let them recite more then a verse or two . I do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves.<br /><br />I just think he could have done something a little more creative . The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out . It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs , or sex , or ? ? ? ? He could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the Passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie . More could have gone into the history of John Smith , the Mormon founder who had quite the colorful past . Delve into science v.s . religion . One is a very methodical , very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories . It builds on itself from a solid bottom up , a new layer on top of a more proved layer . An enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way . The other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims . It is so , because well   I said so.<br /><br />Done right   I 'd say turn it into an HBO original series   hit a different religion every week.<br /><br />It was an eye opener about one thing . I must have been blind . Good ole G.W.Bush ... no wonder he got elected . He had the religious majority . And well ... now that is the blind leading the blind.<br /><br />Bill Moyer .. Well .. what can I expect from a guy who hands out at Sutra in Newport beach ?
0 Now do n't get me wrong . If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind , who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture ? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid , sound reasons why religion has outlived it 's usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins , not BILL MAHER for God 's ( ? ) sake ! That 's a good point in and of itself . Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society , art and science is rooted in it.<br /><br />In this film , he relies heavily on his keenly - honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise . Unfortunately , his intellect is n't up to the task.<br /><br />Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box . As an example , he responds to an interviewee 's ( and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all " ambushees " ) assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan " No , it 's not " followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject 's naivety ( a device nauseatingly overused in this film ) . The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically- suspect gospels . I guess Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus.<br /><br />But the masses will flock to this pseudo - documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore , and they will loudly bray and guffaw ( they certainly did at my showing).<br /><br />It 's doubly telling , however , that the loudest and most mule - like braying occurred during the approximately 70 % of the running time that the film devoted to it 's anti - Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 % devoted to criticizing the self - described Religion of Peace . Hmmm . Either criticism of Islam is off - limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh . Very telling , either way ..
0 I 've been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting . Of course , I am Catholic , come from a well - educated family and go to church of my own volition , which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill 's opinions.<br /><br />Bill 's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative . He 's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion ( or , more accurately , by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God ) , but that said he never looks at its positive side . Quite frankly , I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor . She 's dead now of course , but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries , which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills , get their tattoos removed , and to become responsible members of society , or he could visit USC 's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies , which has brought together some of the world 's finest theologians , diplomats , and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world 's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world 's people who live on less than $ 1 a day . Of course he wo n't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion , and it 's so much easier to continue to make snide , superficial jokes.<br /><br />That fits into the other large problem with Bill 's movie , which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is . In this movie , you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service , in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time , with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ , and with an actor playing Jesus at a " Holy Land " theme park.<br /><br />What you wo n't see in Bill 's film , beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph . D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses , is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame , BYU , or Wheaton College , who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter . You wo n't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C.S. Lewis , G.K. Chesterton , or any papal encyclicals , and of course you also wo n't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non - Abrahamic ( Judaism , Christianity , and Islam ) faiths whatsoever . All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending , snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut - level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W. Bush ( twice ) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it.<br /><br />I get a lot of what Bill 's saying , but for someone possessing his intellect and influence , this film was nothing less than pathetic . Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies .
0 I rented this shortly after renting Ben Stein 's " Expelled " and thought it would interesting to compare them . Before I go further , it seems only fair that I point out the following so a reader can see if I 'm prejudiced or not . I 'm trying to be objective , for the record.<br /><br />I tend to enjoy Maher 's HBO show now and then , though I rarely think he 's the source of the humor . I do n't really care for his stand - up either . But he makes some good points on the show now and again , and I liked Politically Incorrect , though he was still fairly politically correct ( which I deem a negative because the very term sounds Orwellian or at least fascist ) . As for my religious views , I 'll say for simplicity 's sake that I 'm a non - denom . Christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in.<br /><br />That being said , this a bad " documentary " for reasons that have n't been touched on yet by many reviewers -- though the ones mentioned are valid too . The reason it 's not convincing is n't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk ( and his point boils down to nothing logical either , it 's just " come on , really ? " which is n't a point , just a question . Try David Hume if you want a decent argument . ) . The reason this is n't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter . I saw this about 2 months ago and I only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he was n't a clergyman . There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with Masters or Doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring , particularly in the fields of History , Anthropology or a host of others.<br /><br />If one compares this to Ben Stein 's " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed " he 'll find that Stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors , professionals , clergy , etc . He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds . He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education . Maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this . Instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century 's secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio - political power ! ! ! ! ( it 's in the bonus features where he 's standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think . ) This is a true Orwellian head - trip . He blames Christianity in particular on many pointless deaths -- which has had its share , though far smaller than most!!--without even including a basic view of the evidence . Perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism 's miserable record of the 20th Century ALONE.<br /><br />Another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or " average " practitioner . He picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd . How difficult is that ? How does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule ? It does not . Wow , so people in cults think outside of the norm ? How enlightening to know this . Great work Maher ! Again , it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of " patriotic duty " that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in.<br /><br />Beyond all that , he 's just not that funny here . Some of the clips that are overlaid in " clever " out of context / irreverent ways might garner a laugh , but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming , much less convincing . He spends most of his time bashing Christians , spouting inaccuracies , and interviewing fringe groups that he does n't allow to really answer his questions.<br /><br />For the record , there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves . He touches on almost none of these . I get the feeling that I could 've responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed , but the whole thing reeks of deck - stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out .
0 I was n't really hoping for much when I went to see this . After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though , I was hoping for a similar experience here.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously . Do I care about Jason 's problems ? I 'm sorry no . There are a legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway . At at then end of the day , he 's an undead serial killer , I 'm just not going to get that sympathetic.<br /><br />Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not , but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie , it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch ... only not funny.<br /><br / >
0 A movie has rarely left me as cold as this one . There is not a bit of tension , not a second of fear , not a moment we jump , even a little bit . The girl is cute , yeah . That 's it . Was that worth a movie ? I knew it was n't supposed to be a great movie , but I was at least expecting one .
0 Elfriede Jelinek , not quite a household name yet , is a winner of the Nobel prize for literature . Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads . Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?<br /><br />'Gobble , gobble ' is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey . In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception . ' Gobble , gobble ' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners.<br /><br />The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film can not be overstated . It begins very badly , as if made to annoy the viewer . Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes . We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut , apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress , a stony professor of piano . She lives with her husky and domineering mum . Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.<br /><br />Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult , beyond registering its unpleasantness . What we see in the film ( and might read in the book , for all I know ) is a tawdry , exploitative , nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.<br /><br />Erika , whose name is minimally used , is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed . Not quite , because there 's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly - voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies . If a reviewer has to ( yawn ) extract a leitmotif ( why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do ) , Elrika 's violently alternating moods would be it.<br /><br />A young hunk , Walter , studying to become a ' low voltage ' engineer , whatever that is , and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments , is also a talented pianist . He encounters Elrika at an old - fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris . In the glib fashion of so much art , he immediately falls in love and starts to ' cherchez la femme'.<br /><br />Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography , shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.<br /><br />Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika , whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness , hostility , discouragement and humiliation.<br /><br />He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex . Erika retains control over her lovesick swain . She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.<br /><br />In the meantime , chillingly jealous because of Walter 's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert , Erika fills the student 's coat pocket with broken glass , causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano - playing hands.<br /><br />The next big scene ( by - passing the genital self - mutilation , etc ) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother . Erika want to be humiliated , bound , slapped , etc . Sensible Walter is , for the moment , repulsed and marches off into the night.<br /><br />At this point there 's still nearly an hour to go . The viewer can only fear the worst . Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice . They retire to a back room . Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers . His ' baby gravy ' is soon expelled with other stomach contents . Ho hum.<br /><br />Repulsed but hooked , perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor , Walter returns to Erika 's apartment . Can you guess what happens now ? It 's not very deep or difficult . Yes , he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim . One moment he 's locking maman in her room and slapping Erika , the next he 's kicking her in the face , having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love . < br /><br />Am I being unfair in this summary ? Watch the film if you want , but I 'd advise you not to.<br /><br />Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they 're in the right mood . I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted . But I ' prefer not to ' , because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.<br /><br />I'm supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love , ineffectively seeks it in pornography , inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears , pink and throbbing , under her nose , belatedly realises that she does n't like being hurt , blah , blah , blah.<br /><br />The world has , for reasons not explained , stunted her . She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist , because that 's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.<br /><br />At the end , if you have the patience to be there , there 's a small twist . Before going to the final scene , where she 's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear - soiling student with the lacerated hands , Erika packs a knife in her handbag . For Walter?<br /><br />Yes , you 're ahead of me . She stabs herself in a none life - threatening area and leaves . Roll credits.<br /><br />If this earned the second prize at Cannes , just how bad were the rest of the entries ?
0 This movie purports to be a character study of perversion . Some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted , the film is psychologically deep ; actually , considering the salacious material , it is surprisingly tedious and shallow , with no motivational substance . Why is the main character the way she is ? You wo n't find out from the script . For a better treatment of the same theme ( and a more entertaining movie ) , try Bunuel 's Belle de Jour .
0 Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor . The director of " La Pianiste " understands this , providing the viewer with long takes of Huppert 's face , and these are a pleasure to see . Huppert is not an animated actor -- she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile.<br /><br />Other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession , there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it . ( Well , if you enjoy self - mutilation , sado - masochism , and bizarre behavior , " La Pianiste " might work for you . Other than these attributes , I could not find any redeeming value in it.)<br /><br />Buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth . People who compete at the very highest level -- musically , athletically , whatever -- begin as strange people , and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment.<br /><br />Not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson . < br /><br / >
0 I do not fail to recognize Haneke 's above - average film - making skills . For example , I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable - natural - day - lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism . However , regarding the content of this film , I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination - submission relations or feelings ( and/or BDSM practices ) . The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter ( I do n't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way , which is understandable ; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy , or as if he was a monk , come on ! ) . I mean D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something " freakish " or pathological ; it is n't . In general , films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.<br /><br />So , for me , I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film , worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories ( is n't it nearly embarrassing ? ) , and that does not really relate with real - life lives and experiences of those engaged in D / s relationships ( personal experience , forums , irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this ) .
0 Well , the artyfartyrati of Cannes may have liked this film but not me I am afraid . If you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you . A large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness . I did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless . The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot . The plot , however , has little to recommend . A large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano , which might appeal to some people . But lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth . Not recommended .
0 Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it 's intrigue , I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers . Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained " your father died today " comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.<br /><br />This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering . Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film . I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.<br /><br />This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it 's over . I LOVED movies such as " Trainspotting " or " Requiem for a Dream " - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing . To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every turn .
0 I rented the video of " The Piano Teacher " knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box . I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad . Unfortunately , this one falls in the latter category . About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud , " This movie is boring . " About half way through I was saying to myself , " Where have I seen this before ? " At the three quarters mark I had figured it out.<br /><br />In spite of its literary origins , this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman 's much earlier ( 1969 ) , and better , " That Cold Day in the Park . " Although the details obviously differ and Altman 's work was more plot - driven and less of a character study , the two films are thematically identical . There is nothing " new " to be seen in this production . Every aspect of it has been done before : a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self - destructive behavior ( Abel Ferrara 's " Bad Lieutenant " 1992 ) ; a perverse and doomed ' love ' culminating in an operatic ( near ) death scene ( David Cronenberg 's " M. Butterfly " 1993 ) ; uncommonly brutal sex scenes ( David Lynch 's " Blue Velvet " 1986 ) ; and so on . Hence , I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be " shocking , " " shattering , " etc . This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable , and clearly succeeded with some . However , I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film - viewing experience . See enough movies and you really will , eventually , have seen it all . And while it is true that I saw the expurgated ' R - rated ' version , I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of " The Piano Teacher." < br /><br />Technically , the film is not without merit . There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent . Isabelle Huppert 's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time . This is the first of Haneke 's films that I 've seen , and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara : an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be . Rating : 4/10 .
0 I read the reviews of this movie , and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it . I 'm a big Francophile and art film lover , but I believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something " arty " or " intellectual " into something it is not . I will be blunt : it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that I never , ever wanted to actually see . Obviously , the piano teacher has some major psychological issues , but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically . The film is , in essence , disgusting . I mean , when I saw Requiem for a Dream , I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly , but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film .
0 I 've seen all kinds of " Hamlet"s . < br /><br />Kenneth Branagh 's was most ambitious , Mel Gibson 's was quick and to the point , Laurence Olivier 's was the best - hands down . But now we come to Maximilian Schell 's take on the Bard.<br /><br />For one , this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare 's venerable chestnut . But if there 's a slower , more plodding , more lethargic and worse - staged version out there somewhere , it must have been acted at grade school - level . < br /><br />Having seen it on MST3 K helps , with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy , puncturing the profundity of black and white TV , Shakespeare and the wisdom ( ? ) of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject.<br /><br />Of course , the best parts are the MST riffs . Best lines ? " I 'm gon na unleash the Great Dane " , " I do n't think so , ' breather ' " , " Meet the Beatles " , " Hey , Dad , will you help me with my science project " and , my personal favorite , during a party - " Garrison Keillor 's leaving Germany ( YAAAY!!)".<br /><br />But then there 's Schell , playing Shakespeare 's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would , only not as expressive . No doubt he 's a great actor , but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in " The Silver Chalice " . Ever see that one ? You GOTTA watch these two on a double - bill!<br /><br />In the end , this is one instance where it 's true that you 're much better off to just read the book . At least the book is n't dubbed by Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />One star only for this " Hamlet " ; ten stars , naturally , for the MST3 K version.<br /><br />Good - night , not - so - sweet prince .
0 ... this verson does n't mangle the Bard that badly . It 's still a horrible minimalist production , Hamlet 's Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard ( whether it 's Ricardo Montalban or not is subject to debate ) , and Maximilian Schell overacts like never before . Most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed , and the fact that the MST3 K version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long * duh * does n't strike me as incredibly humorous . Mostly it 's just bad acting , though .
0 There 's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis . I mean it 's Shakespeare 's Hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written . I 'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have  through Mystery Science Theater 3000 . While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie , in this case I can not imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips . In a word , this German , made - for - TV version of Hamlet is dreary . 152 minutes ? No way ! It 's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on . I 've said it any number of times , but entertainment is the thing for me . And this wrist - slitter is far from entertaining . I will , however , give it a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting . A 3/10 sounds about right to me.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy MST3 K , their comments do n't help to make Hamlet any more palatable . There are a few good riffs here and there , but overall , Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow . As much as it pains me , I 've got to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3 K rating scale .
0 Take:<br /><br />1 . a famous play < br /><br />2 . a director with now ideas of his own who is using < br /><br />3 . a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1.<br /><br />4 . an actor for the lead - who has no feeling for the part he 's playing And you 'll get : " Hamlet , Prinz von Dänemark" < br /><br />I listened to the radio play of " Hamlet " with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was so disappointed . I hoped that the filmed version would be better , that Schell would at least have a body language to underline what he 's saying - nothing . Then the set ... the minimalistic design is not everyone 's taste , but usually I like it when there 's just enough on the stage to make clear what 's the setting and nothing more . Alas , that 's on a stage , in a theatre . It wo n't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings . That the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which Schell played the Hamlet already ... let 's say if that was the only thing to complain about ... I ask myself how Schell could get the part of Hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play Hamlet a second time . If you 've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on " Hamlet " , do n't watch this one , unless you 're a masochist , or really hardcore , or like to poke fun on untalented actors .
0 Yay ! ... I think . It 's hard to say . It 's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion . This movie is as sterile as a surgeon 's scalpel . For a setting , it has a few stone pillars , some stone seats , a couple stone crosses and some stone actors . They have no emotion ! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet , and Hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature . The dubbing really was n't all that bad though . The voices stuck true to the dull , gloomy , dreary , life - sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth . I have seen this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times , and each of the three times , I was on the brink of turning off the TV , despite it being MST 3K.<br /><br />Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better .
0 Alas , poor Hamlet . I knew him , dear reader , and let me tell thee , THIS VERSION SUCKS ! I do n't know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam , but I hope that they 're proud of themselves . They took THE classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable . This version is quite literally so bad , that not even the presence of a great thespian like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save it . This movie 's only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for " MST3 K " ; Mike , Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with this one.<br /><br />But either way , I 'm sure that Shakespeare , had he been alive when they made this , would not have wanted his name associated with it . This " Hamlet " is not even so bad that 's it good ; it 's just plain bad . Absolutely dreadful .
0 note to George Litman , and others : the Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is " I do n't think so , * breeder*".<br /><br />my favorite riff is " Why were you looking at his ' like ' ? " , simply for the complete absurdity . that , and " Right well did not ! " over all , I would say we must give credit to the MST3 K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie . you really ca n't make much fun of the dialog ; Bill S was a good playwright . on the other hand , this production is so bad that even he would disown it . a junior high school drama club could do better.<br /><br />I would recommend that you buy a book and read ' Hamlet ' .
0 I 'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3 K , so I waited anxiously to see this episode . I 'll comment on the movie first , then the MST3 K episode . The recipe for this movie : take talented actors , rich and beautiful Shakespeare material , and a $ 1.25 budget . Mix well , then drain of all life and movement , until dull and lifeless . Serve cold in a big , plain stone cauldron . Movie , I give 3 out of 10 , because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit . Okay , now the MST3 K episode . I 'll admit it , the first time I saw it , I fell asleep halfway through . I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well . However , when I watched it a second time , I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time around . The trick with this episode is : listen carefully ! It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line . Give it a second chance , and You 'll see what I mean . MST3 K Episode : 7 1/2 out of 10 .
0 Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German - TV adaptaion of his classic play . It 's obvious that very little money was spent on it . A stage riser , a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set . The movie was ineptly dubbed into English , with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines . The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it . And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway ? MST3 K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be ? I wish this movie never was in the first place .
0 I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie . Granted , it 's Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not . But this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not , that may prevent many from just not caring about a Shakespeare based story.<br /><br />The largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters . Often during character 's interacting , it 's nearly difficult to distinguish who 's lines are who 's . Granted , I believe this movie is dubbed in English . Certainly they could 've obtained voice actors which could 've added a bit more drama to these classic , literary lines.<br /><br />It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 , although perhaps that 's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget . Still , it 's absolutely painful and boring . If you insist on Hamlet , do yourself a favor and read the book again . 1/10
0 Ming The Merciless does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul !
0 You all know the story of " Hamlet " . I do . < br /><br / > Well , the " To Be Or Not To Be " phrase ( not the speech itself ) has been beaten into the ground so many times that it 's not very interesting ( in fact , it was n't that great to begin with ) . In FACT , I find " Hamlet " a good but vastly overrated play . It 's not even Shakespeare 's best : " Julius Caesar " and " Romeo & Juliet " are ten times better , with " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " and " Othello " not too far behind . " Macbeth ( knock your table , off his drawers , puck will make amends , OW ! ) " is n't that bad either . There are lots of others that are better than this by Shakespeare.<br /><br / > I wo n't really comment too much on the movie , rather I will dissect the utterly horrible MST3 K episode.<br /><br / > Okay . . . Mike and the Bots win a card game , get to pick the movie . . . they ask for " Hamlet " , Pearl sends them this , yadda yadda yadda . . . and prepare for the most boring Sci - Fi episode of MST3 K ever ( admittedly , I have n't seen any of the CC Ones).<br /><br / > While " Blood Waters of Dr. Z " makes the viewing of that episode horrible , since it is not really a movie , rather random , spliced - together scenes ( I 'm reminded of Mike 's line from " Future War " : " Maybe this is an anthology of short , plotless movies " ) , the SOL Crew a lot got off a good many good cracks . Ca n't say the same for here.<br /><br / > The riffs fall flat , the host segments ( par usual ) are at best mediocre , and when the movie itself ( which is n't that bad ) is actually BETTER ( I mean , as a quality movie , not as camp , like " Prince of Space " ) than the MST3 K version of it , you know the show must be bad . I laughed ( the last time I saw it was several months ago ) , oh , maybe eight or nine times throughout . I tried and tried AND TRIED to be entertained - but I just could n't . Only the occasional line , like " Hail Queen Dilbert 's boss ! " ( and when that 's the funniest line of the episode , well , ahem ) - and by occasional , I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe me even chuckle . The second time I tried to watch it , I did n't even laugh at the few jokes I 'd found funny before , and simply gave up forty minutes before.<br /><br / > The movie is n't horrible ; it 's just a German version of Hamlet . The actors are good enough , and though the dubbing is n't the greatest , that 's not in itself a reason to hate this film . < br /><br / > Four stars for " Hamlet " ; THREE , yes THREE for the MST3 K version.<br /><br / > PS : WHY WHY WHY , MST3 K !
0 This Hamlet made for one of the boringest MST3000 episodes ever . I am not a Shakespear fan , but I do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab . It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed . Like I said though this one is quite boring . It is in black and white , the pacing is slow , and there is minimal scenery . The actors are all dubbed too so that does n't help . This is the one MST 3000 I ca n't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep .
0 Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man ( John Carradine ) dying and leaving everything to his four children , and his servants to be divided up equally . One condition -- they must spend one week in his estate to get the money . And if any of them die , the others get more . Guess what happens next .... < br /><br />I saw a brand new print of this film on cable . The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful . That 's about all the good things I can say about it.<br /><br />Let 's list just some of the problems this film has : the killer is screamingly obvious ; the servants are called Igor and Elga -- come on ! ; some of the sound recording was so bad I could n't make out the dialogue ( no great loss I 'm sure ) ; the gore was sparse and very poorly done ; the other murders were simply boring , stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting -- so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief . Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible ! The only fairly good acting was from trouper Faith Domergue ( who deserved better than this ) and John Carradine ( who looks painfully old and frail here ) . I do have to admit though -- the closing line in this movie is a gem!<br /><br />Why this was renamed " Legacy of Blood " is beyond me -- there 's another 1978 horror film with that name!<br /><br />Whatever its name is , it 's a bad movie . To be avoided at all costs .
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean , John Carradine , to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune , some 140 million dollars . The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion . There seemed to have been a mix - up in the story when we later find out that it 's really an overnight sleepover , not a weeks vacation , at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Dean 's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise.<br /><br />The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia , Rodolfo Acosta . Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests . Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura's , Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond.<br /><br />The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until it 's revealed who the killer really is . We then have what seems to be a double - twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest . The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot , 140 million dollars , but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him , or her , in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot.<br /><br />Nonsensical who done it , and haunted house , movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother , much less the audience , would have trouble liking . There 's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S&M sadism and of course double - dealing and back - stabbing not even counting murder . You just could n't care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do.<br /><br />Even the big surprise at the end is n't really that much of a surprise since the killer 's identity is divulged with the film - maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself ! We then have a plot - twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is . The final plot - twist , that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away , was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie .
0 Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake ( Norman Bartold ) to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean ( John Carradine ) , upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr. Dean 's four children , Gregory ( Jeff Morrow ) & his wife Laura ( Merry Anders ) , Victoria ( Faith Domergue ) , Johnny ( Richard Davalos ) plus Leslie ( Brooke Mills ) & her fella Carl Isenberg ( John Smith ) . Drake plays a tape recording of they 're late Father 's wishes after his death , the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children , if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants Elga ( Ivy Bethune ) , Igor ( Buck Kartalian ) & the more mundanely named Frank ( John Russell ) would pocket the lot . Well , not satisfied with a quarter share of $ 136 million ( which is still almost $ 35 million back in 1971 which does n't sound too bad to me ) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it 's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge ... <br /><br />Co - written , produced & directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy disappointed me on two accounts . For starters this film 's alternate & much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in ' 78 which I 've always wanted to see , both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film & even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it & I heard John Carradine 's voice & I then knew it was n't the Milligan film that I had wanted to see , my heart sank . Then , of course , there 's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times . The script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow , boring & extremely predictable . The character 's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way , the freak of a servant who ask 's his sister ( ? ) to cane him , the strange set of Brother 's & Sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then there 's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes . It 's boring to watch , it 's poorly paced & it 's just a chore to even think about it . Please , someone save me as this is really bad stuff . I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is , I really could.<br /><br />Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he should n't have even been directing traffic . The entire film looks ugly , it 's poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares . The blood & gore is tame , there 's an axe in a head , a decapitated head , a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp 's & the best murder when someone 's face is eaten by piranha . However there are question marks over this scene , so there 's the victim , right . There 's the tank of piranha , right . Victims head is placed in piranha tank , right . Pirahna eat victims face , right . Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten , erm where 's the blood?<br /><br />Technically Blood Legacy is terrible , it looks awful , the sound was obviously shot live & it 's muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise . The acting was not going to win anyone any awards that 's for sure , the least said about it the better.<br /><br />Blood Legacy is an awful film , there really is n't a single positive aspect to it or if there is I ca n't think of it . Do yourself a favour & do n't bother with this one , there are much better films out there .
0 Terrible ... just terrible . Probably the worst film I have ever seen . And I did see some pretty bad pictures , throughout the years . The sound sucks so does the quality of the picture , the direction , the acting ... etc , etc . The only good shoots ( meaning funny , because they 're so bad ) are the special effects . Overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs . The rest of the flick gives you brain damage .
0 I happen to have bought one of those " Legacy of Horror " 50 movie pack collections and would you believe I 'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it . Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devil 's Messenger or The Devil Bat , or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock 's films ( some are n't horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense ) but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they ca n't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter.<br /><br />So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea . The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine ( the one standing feature of this ) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates . Carradine gives a good enough performance as always , but he 's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre / terrible performances . The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes . Given this was an independent film of the 70 's the lighting and effects are pretty limited . It 's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer ca n't see what 's happening that well in some scenes . Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and I 'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who - done - it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film . You are n't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic , but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable . The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there . It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack " Chilling " containing films like House on a Haunted Hill , Little Shop of horror 's with Jack Nicholson , and Night of the Living Dead over it . This is best avoided .
0 A grade - Z horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low - budget gory mayhem . His movies are full of inept gore , laughable acting , boring sub - plots and woeful dialogue . A mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion . Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless . You do n't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters . The pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting . The acting is merely competent , but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed . A generous 4 out of 10.Just beware : do not mistake Monson 's film with Andy Milligan 's equally weak " Legacy of Blood " .
0 A family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order . People die ( and so will you if you try to sit through this ) If you 've ever had any desire to see bad actors- many with ill fitting dentures - act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance . This is just awful . Its so bad I thought Al Adamson , one of the worst directors ever , directed it , but I was wrong.<br /><br />Its so bad I do n't want to say anything more about it , not because it is n't polite but because once I start I may not be able to stop.<br /><br />avoid
0 You know a movie will not go well when John Carradine narrates ( a.k.a . reads the script & plot synopsis ) over his character 's funeral procession , a mere 5 minutes into the movie . The narration is his character 's last will & testament . It stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants . The children shall split $ 136 million equally , but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders . If all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants . To be eligible , they must live in the family estate for a week . It sounds like the typical plot of a reality show.<br /><br />There is little subtext as to the nature of the Deans . They are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family , but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog . From the opening voice - over by John Carradine you expect this movie will lead to a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending . < br /><br />That journey is painfully slow and pointless . We trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around , playing pool , throwing darts , the misuse of the " through the fish bowl " shot , dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men , constant bickering , misplaced circus music , bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux - German expressionism , the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting . This all inevitably leads to the expected & ungratifying ending . You will be happy to still be alive , but the pain might be too great to bear alone . Share children , share.<br /><br />-Celluloid Rehab
0 OK , how 's this for original- this mean , rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children , all of them ungrateful losers , and two creepy servants , provided they spend the week in his spooky old house . What happens that night will surprise only those who have n't seen a movie or television show before . After a string of murders in which the victims look like they 're bleeding restaurant ketchup , we have a painfully obvious twist ending . The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks . There are also a few second - tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now . As a result , the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of " Matlock . " I will give credit where it 's due- the closing scene is clever and amusing , if you 're still awake .
0 Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister , she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them . VCR 'S had just became a household item and we did n't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them.<br /><br />I was at a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie I do n't have and I knew this movie looked familiar . I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought . She had sold it years ago in a yard sale I am guessing - who knows.<br /><br />I did n't recall anything at all about it and I watched it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes . I am not sure how I felt about it as a kid but I am sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I 'd watch and enjoy anything back then.<br /><br />I am a horror freak , but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it " good " and this one fell very short . It was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types . What death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and that s if you 're lucky you get that much.<br /><br />The story is good and I have seen a few with similar plots , so I think this one should be buried and forgotten . Do n't watch this people unless you 're hard up .
0 This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen , as it 's absolutely god awful , John Carradine has very limited screen time . All the characters are boring , and the story is terrible , plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!. The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it was n't so damn boring , and there is n't one character to root for either , plus I hope it makes it 's way to the bottom 100 , because it deserves to be there in my opinion . When John Carradine finally shows up at the end , it 's a pretty good scene but it 's already way too late , and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks , plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee 's , as it was rather gory . I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion , plus it 's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen , as It 's absolutely god awful , John Carradine has very limited screen time , and I say avoid it like the plague ! , you do n't want to go through the torture . The Direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible ! job here , making every thing look cheap , wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace . The Acting is just as bad . John Carradine is good in his scene , but other then that he 's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes . ( Carradine Ruled ! ! ) . Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura , as she did n't convince me at all . Ivy Bethune is OK , and somewhat creepy , but also overacted , she did have a creepy smile at the end though . Rest of the cast , I did n't pay enough attention too , as I had a lot of trouble getting through it , but they were all really bad . Overall please avoid this , It 's not worth the agony!. BOMB out of 5
0 The husband - and - wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville , yet they made very few films . As is the case for some other performers of their era ( George M. Cohan , Fanny Brice , Gertrude Lawrence ) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them , in which they 're portrayed by other actors : ' Somebody Loves Me ' , starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song - and - dance man Ralph Meeker.<br /><br />In their heyday , Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband - and - wife vaudeville act -- Jesse Block and Eve Sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act , effectively becoming the " second - team " Fields and Seeley . Offstage , though , there was a major difference in the couples ' living arrangements . Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites , paying room - service rates for every meal they ate , and eventually running out of money . Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely , ending in comfortable retirement.<br /><br />The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats - wearing pianists . Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 , although I 've never heard of them . Finally , Fields and Seely rush in and start performing . They both have plenty of pep , and she 's fairly attractive.<br /><br />I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they 're about to break into a dance , but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short . When they finally start hoofing , the results are not impressive.<br /><br />I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act . Now that I 've seen it , I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals . My rating for this one : just 4 out of 10 , and I 'll stick with Block and Sully .
0 When great director / actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned . Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre . Unfortunately Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter . < br /><br />That 's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better . But for the life of me I do n't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl , a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out . That might have been good for another film altogether , but it served no purpose here.<br /><br />A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who 's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals . That part could also have used a little explaining as well . But he 's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl.<br /><br />Bronson 's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper . A stylish , murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history . In fact in the film 's best scene , Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire.<br /><br />At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack , he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone , but Bronson and Lopez . I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez . But that 's another terribly big hole in the plot.<br /><br />Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez . I wish the whole film had been better though . This was the last film of the Bronson - Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson 's last as a director . He should have gone out with something better .
0 Charles Bronson stars as Lt Crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named Duke ( Juan Fernandez ) who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed Crowe 's daughter ( Amy Hathaway ) in this sleazy yet stylishly helmed revenge thriller . Kinjite may not be for everyone with it 's somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining .
0 Offering a killer combo of terrible writing , terrible acting and terrible direction , it 's a tossup whether Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad . It 's almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest , seediest Cannon film . As if a glance at a cast list including characters like ' Lesbian Pedophile , ' ' Perverted Gentleman , ' ' Porno Actress ' were n't enough , it 's your only chance to see Charles Bronson 's cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo - but do n't worry , it 's okay , as the offscreen screams make clear he 's only torturing him for information . After all , even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice Catholic daughter , he 's a nice Catholic cop who regularly brings local Catholic priest William O'Connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice - or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine . But then that 's what you get for telling him " Look , I think you 're a little bit unstable . " Still , when later offered a bribe , he may snarl " I 'd like to shove this up your ass , but I do n't want to get my hands dirty , " he 's clearly learned where to draw the line : instead , he just makes him eat a $ 25,000 watch and sets fire to his Cadillac . The anal obsession even follows through to the film 's title : despite the poster featuring a naked Japanese girl on a porn film set , the film 's only direct example of Kinjite / forbidden subjects , as Alex Hyde White 's English teacher explains to a group of Japanese businessmen , is , er talking about your bowel movements in polite society.<br /><br />Bronson is n't just too old for this , as the opening fight makes only too clear , he 's too old for love interest Peggy Lipton , and she looks old enough to have grown - up kids . A better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material , here 's he 's given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks . When he 's not widening the circles of suspects he 's accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings . He 's definitely not a P.C. copper , with a special loathing for the Japanese - as if it was n't bad enough that they 're buying up American businesses , what 's worse , they double - park on a public thoroughfare ! No racial minority goes unassaulted , be they black pimp or Pakistani hotel clerk , no cop cliché unrecycled , be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner ( Perry Lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that 's so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own ) . The twin plot strands - Bronson 's L.A. cop trying to take down Juan Hernandez 's pimp who deals in underage girls and James Pax 's porn - obsessed Japanese businessman  take forever to intertwine , and then in the most unlikely of ways : after copping a feel of Bronson 's daughter on a bus ( " Some Oriental guy touched my holy of holies ! " ) , in the film 's idea of poetic justice Pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by Hernandez . You half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say , " How d'ya like them apples?" < br /><br />Somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is , but the execution is pure Rising Sun : the Archie Bunker Version , shot like out - takes from an R - rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot-'em - up - and - blow'em - up finale that sees a small army of machine - gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count . The last of Bronson 's mostly bad to in different collaborations with J. Lee Thompson  and sadly Thompson 's last film as director - it 's a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to .
0 The ' 80 's were not very kind to one - time major star Charles Bronson . Starting with 1982 's " Death Wish II " and ending with this truly gruesome film from ' 89 , Bronson 's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness . " D.W. II " left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson 's character 's daughter , ( a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail ) . " 10 to Midnight " was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards . Nothing redeeming about it . Other films like " The Evil that Men Do " and the remaining " Death Wish " films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge . I 'm not sure if the producers ( usually Pancho Kohner ) got a kick out of showing a weary looking , senior citizen - aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what , but the shoddy craftsmanship ( and terrible scripts ) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated.<br /><br />"Kinjite " -- the last of these films -- is fairly well - made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness . In this film Bronson : sodomizes a perverse john ; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch ; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner ; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I 've thankfully forgotten . Also depicted is the gang - rape of a young Japanese girl ( fortunately , this was off - screen , though well - implied).<br /><br />What were people thinking when they made this film ? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films ? For anyone interested in his best movies , check out most of the films he made in the ' 60 's and ' 70 's like " The Mechanic " , " Death Wish " , " From Noon til 3 " , " Once Upon a Time in the West " , " Red Sun " , " The Great Escape " , " The Magnificent Seven " , " Rider on the Rain " , etc . , etc ....
0 Repugnant Bronson thriller . Unfortunately , it 's technically good and I gave it 4/10 , but it 's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it " entertainment " . Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film .
0 Charles Bronson continued his 80 's slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade , if not ever . In it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an Asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder . It 's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made . A lot of people consider the Death Wish sequels to be Bronson 's worst movies . The Death Wish sequels were n't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable . Kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation . It really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a " Law and Justice " mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything . Indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with Bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo . The Chicago theater I watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene , only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film . It has no point other than to exploit and really the movie was n't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work . Bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save . I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst . The action sequences are poor also.<br /><br />1/2 * out of 4-(Awful )
0 This film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny TV sitcom . In Puerto Rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film , almost silencing all others . Coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners . The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film 's form and content , and pointed out all its flaws , clichés , and bad writing.<br /><br />Just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes , and because one can recognize actors and scenery , does not make it an acceptable film .
0 Do n't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography . When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers , leaves a lot to be said . I was expecting something better from award winning actor Benicio del Toro . The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores . A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context ( see the movie Elsa and Fred for example ) but it should not permeate the plot . The movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film .
0 " What happens when you give a homeless man $ 100,000 ? " As if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen . The creators of " Reversal of Fortune " try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experiment.<br /><br />They take Ted , a homeless man in Pasadena , and give him $ 100,000 to see if he will turn his life around . Then , with only the most cursory guidance and counseling , they let him go on his merry way.<br /><br />What are they trying to say ? " Money ca n't buy you happiness ? " " The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be ? " Or how about , " Lift a man up - it 's more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude . " They took a man with nothing to lose , gave him something to lose , and then watched him dump it all down the drain . That 's supposed to be entertainment ? They dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots , but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos - only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked , " What happens when you take down a stop sign ? "
0 as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless . TV told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad , and claimed we all made over $ 100 a day when $ 20 - 40 a day was much closer to reality . when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work , and offered me work , i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $ 100,000 i d damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years , and kept most in the bank and still left myself $ 10 - 20000 for NL $ 1 - 2 and $ 2 - 5 cash games at the casinos . i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll . instead i win about $ 1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all . i was only homeless cause i did n't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke , sometimes i had over $ 1000 - 2000 in my sock while i slept outside . anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though , due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs . i m no longer homeless , am now in govt housing for $ 177 a month and getting SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker . mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me SSI . glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping , worrying about getting caught by security are finally over . had this TV crew picked me they d been over a lot sooner . its a shame how they do n't better select who they pick .
0 What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm ? Homeless people answer to no one . They have no mortgages , rent payments or idiot bosses . Homeless people do n't have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments . But , give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and , suddenly , they have to worry about entering the rat race , buying gas for transportation , paying insurance on their car , and working for someone else . They get a chance to be a " productive citizens . " This film was about as exploitive as a film can be . It 's a way for the rich and middle - class sheeple to say " see what happens when you try to help the poor ? " and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance.<br /><br />Why not a film that asks , " What happens when you take away everything a rich man has ? "
0 This film is " riveting " but in much the same way a car crash is riveting . It 's hard to look away . Overall , this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment -- and a futile , biased experiment at that . The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator . The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation . The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in ( meeting with so - called experts ) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted . Instead , it 's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker 's posteriors and to further exploit Ted 's situation . The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months ; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before . If they had cared , they would have found better " experts " to help Ted . If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do , then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention . This film is at best a high - brow Jackass stunt and not a documentary . It 's sad to think how much $ 100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person 's life had it been put in the right hands .
0 I had read a few positive reviews of this film , and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was . Positioned as some cross between an AIDS - related story and some kind of " Ghost"/"Blithe Spirit " tale , this film ca n't always make it 's mind up what it wants to be . < br /><br />Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an " open " relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous ( though safe ) sex on the side when he wants . Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon do n't seem to have a sex life anymore . When Mark dies , Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor . Not that his behavior before Mark 's death was much different . But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts , while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings.<br /><br />Unfortunately , Simon is such a selfish SOB , it 's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film . By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic , it 's too late to care . Mark , on the other hand , follows in Demi Moore 's footsteps from " Ghost , " by crying profusely throughout the movie . < br /><br />There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns . Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor , a la the TV show " Bewitched . " But that does n't last long . Once Simon 's emotional health is at stake , the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish , with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings . The finale , with a gold - plated muscle - boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened , grief - stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying , chiefly because it is n't intentionally funny .
0 The box for " To Die For " suckered me in -- a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex . There was plenty of Thomas Arklie ( Simon ) , who 's easy on the eyes , but no laughs and little sexiness.<br /><br />The couple , Mark and Simon , have allegedly been together several years , but neither character is interesting enough to care about , so it 's hard to imagine that they care about each other . The fault seems to lie in the script , not the performances ; both actors do the best they can with what they 're given . < br /><br />The ending is sappy and unaffecting ( well , not totally unaffecting ; I felt relief that it was over ) . < br /><br />If you 're looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that 's funny , " Parting Glances " is far better .
0 I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life . This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I do n't know how I sat through an hour of it . I must have been in a coma that night . I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago . I could n't even remember the name , but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it . It must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today . Yech ! Vomit ! Barf !
0 I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie . After all , this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind , and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid ( even before Tolkien ) . I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT . They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera . The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles . It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles ( who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix - like powers , utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem ) turn to " Fabio on the beach " in the guise of Pitt ( who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced ) . The actors were actually decent , trying to make the best of a ridiculous script . It was actually a waste of so much talent ( Peter O'Toole stole the show , and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic ) . Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it does n't even hold a candle to them . Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege . I would n't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was ( at least they got that part right ) .
0 I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed . The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache . The pacing was so slow , the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles ( Pitt ) and Hector ( Bana ) - the rest was shallow.<br /><br />And why , oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit ' consumer approval ' . Agamemnon did n't die in Troy , the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle ! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.<br /><br />And do n't even start me on the ' lack ' of chemistry between Helen and Paris . She was the woman the war was fought over and it did n't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other . No sparks , no emotion , no hope.<br /><br />I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt , Eric Bana and Peter O ' Toole acted very well with a bad script but that is n't enough to save this awful movie . < br /><br />Can anybody tell me where the £ 200 million budget went ? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees?<br /><br />I am so disappointed it hurts .
0 Hello there,<br /><br />This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while . I would therefore like to salute you all . The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.<br /><br />I spent 2 years of my life , ( all we Greeks did actually ) , analysing Omirus epos ( and not Homers as you see everywhere ) , rhyme by rhyme . If I recall well it was Iliada ( Iliad ) on 8th grade and Odysseia ( Odyssey ) on 9th grade . Warner 's Troy , was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus ( I study in the UK).<br /><br />Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made . It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war . Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC , and the actual reason of the war not being Helen 's beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy . That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events ( as it 's not accurate historically ) but this was never the purpose of this work . < br /><br />Reading this huge poem , one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour , love , anger , hate , heroism , discipline , loyalty and so on . The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle . None of these though were revealed in ' Troy'<br /><br />Warner 's Troy was really cheap to my eyes , and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well . It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario . By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster ( computers graphics did the whole work ) , and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen 's best work . < br /><br />I conclude saying that you 'd better watch something else instead . I would give Troy 2 out of 10 . It is a really expensive B movie.<br /><br />Cheers < br /><br />Alex
0 Went to see the movie " Troy " this afternoon . Here 's what I learned:<br /><br />Contrary to popular opinion and history in general , Greek men were not gay . EVER . This was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter . So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie.<br /><br />Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup . She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which , though numerous , were probably all filmed on the same day , one after the other , with the director saying , " Alright , now look beautiful . . . good ... OK , now look frightened ... good ... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested . . . good ... now look beautiful again ... good ... " < br /><br />Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents . Those with American accents could n't act.<br /><br />Trojans looked just like Greeks , but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does not blink on camera.<br /><br />Helen of Troy 's biggest line was , " They 're coming for me." < br /><br />Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music.<br /><br />Brad Pitt 's thighs go all the way up.<br /><br />Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close , but it 's OK . They were cousins . Never mind what history says.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression.<br /><br />Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names , but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag.<br /><br />Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting , much like American men.<br /><br />All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color ... Light Egyptian , by Max Factor.<br /><br />Troy had only three women.<br /><br />There were lots of blond Greeks , which is good news for Brad Pitt , who would otherwise have really stuck out.<br /><br />Despite their coastal desert locale , Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires , funeral pyres , Trojan horses and the like.<br /><br />British actors look silly with Greek hairdos.<br /><br />Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.<br /><br />Greek soldiers fought constantly , but their outfits always looked impeccable.<br /><br />Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts.<br /><br />Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins , even back when they were all new .
0 I like Brad Pitt enormously . He is an actor with brains and wit , not to mention face , pectorals and all the rest . Since I saw him in " Thelma and Louise " a thought has been bothering me , who does he remind me of ? " Troy " did it for me . He is the new Brigitte Bardot . The differences are obvious of course . Male , American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless . He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it . " Kalifornia " " 12 Monkeys " " Fight Club " " Snatch " His self deprecating humor makes him human , almost accessible . Fortunately " Troy " will soon be forgotten . Only still photographs with Pitt , semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans . Strange , " Das Boot " is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century . What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this ? Well , I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot .
0 To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make . But what can I tell you ? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star . It crosses that barrier . It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory . Brando had it in spades , Montgomery Clift , Gary Cooper , James Dean of course and in more recent times , Tom Cruise , Jude Law , Johnny Depp , Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup . Women fell in love with Garbo , Dietrich , Katharine and Audrey Hepburn , Grace Kelly , Marilyn Monroe , Julie Christie , Charlotte Rampling , Meryl Streep , Vanessa Redgrave , Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman . But Brad Pitt has , singlehandedly , redefined the concept . He is the only reason to go out , get in the car , find parking , buy a ticket , popcorn and get into a theatre to see " Troy " If you liked epics in the " Jupiter 's Darling " style you may enjoy this . But if you do n't , go all the same , we want to keep Brad Pitt in business .
0 Well , were to start ? This is by far one of the worst films I 've ever paid good money to see . I wo n't comment on the story itself , it 's a wonderful classic , but here it feels like a soap opera . To start with , the acting , except for Eric Bana , is soap opera quality . I 've always been a fan of Brad Pitt , but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame . The camera action does n't help , either . How it lingers on him when he 's thinking , it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester 's days in the lab ! Peter O'Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery , or he is desperately in need of one . Either way , he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans ! And to end my comments , Diane Kruger is a cute girl , but she sure is no Helen of Troy . Peterson should rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role , since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather miscast by now .
0 I know nothing of the Iliad so can not comment on it 's accuracy to that story . However , as a stand alone film I found this very boring . The battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious CGI.<br /><br />The acting is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt was cast just to attract the ladies . But he does not make a good warrior , too pretty i am afraid.<br /><br />Good points are is the design . This film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings / walls impressive . I do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely . we hear American , Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation.<br /><br />All in all , I do not recommend this film for a family sit down . It is too long and the young will get bored.<br /><br />For adults , it is OK if you do n't care about the lack realism .
0 As was to be expected , A Mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter - culture , sympathetic towards the hippies - and have a lot of hippies in it - and , naturally , it is childishly anti - authoritarian ( e.g. the scene on the Mexican border , when Sutherland provokes a custom 's officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he ( Sutherland ) has long hair ) . The constant left - wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had I not been prepared for it beforehand ; Sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film , and most of these ideas are either about blacks or Indians ( needless to say , he would be welcomed with open arms in today 's Hollywood ) . One of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in Beverly Hills - a race - war , so - to - speak , in the middle of L.A .. This is the kind of nonsense that Mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies . Fortunately , some of Sutherland 's hippie friends make fun of this black - revolution premise , and the resulting dialogue is n't bad ; a little later , the Jewish guy makes a crack about Sutherland making a movie about " masturbation and the black problem " , when the latter starts talking about masturbation . Another funny moment is when Sutherland 's older daughter performs some PC crap on stage with her white school - mates , and they all say : " We , the black people of the Republic of South Africa ... ".<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of self - indulgence when Hollywood makes a movie about Hollywood - especially when it 's Hollywood making a movie about Hollywood discussing Hollywood doing movies . Now , that 's very , very self - indulgent , indeed . The scene with Fellini ( playing himself ) is more amusing than annoying , though . Mazursky throws in the standard flower - children and anti - Vietnam bullshit into the soup , and also pokes fun at corporate Hollywood , but he was / is just as much a part of the " phony Hollywood " ( lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment ) as anyone else ; I am pretty sure that he , too , makes phony small - talk in Beverly Hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either does n't know or like , but whose money he wants badly for his next ( left - wing ) project . As for his hair : he has the worst hair I 've seen in a very long time ( on film or elsewhere ) ; it 's sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle - aged accountant would have if he grew it long . The film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness , but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third . If you 'd like to read my parody / biography of Donald Sutherland ( and other Hollywood actors ) , contact me by e - mail .
0 Does anything at all happen in this movie . There are only the bizarre short scenes where I did n't know what the hell was going on so that does n't count . This movie is sooo boring it hurts , and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies . Confused ? , well I was after watching this crap . What was Donald Sutherland on , because he missed it with this one completely . And what 's with the " pedofile " scene at the beginning of the movie . Can put anyone to sleep ! 4/10
0 This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen . Terrible acting , terrible effects , terrible writing , you get my drift . The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it 's amazing . Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience . It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination , you 'd love this show . That is a horrible approach to a TV - series . A visual media like this should spark your imagination , you should n't have to force your imagination into something to make it good . That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie , and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever . " If a movie is boring , I just make up my own story." < br /><br />In conclusion : Absolute human waste .
0 i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry . Porretta was good looking but resembled like a Mexican porn star not an English outlaw . costumes ? what costumes ? a t - shirt with strips of black leather on it . it was Marion 's clothes -- or lack of them -- that really got me . do the ' fans ' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england . the Mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid , but the episode with an ALIEN was worst of all . Especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face -- an old trick . The hedgehog monster was pretty funny , as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows -- as if . the US accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over ' RAW - bin Hood and LIDDLE John'.the second robin and Marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan ...
0 I expected this to be a lot better . I love Tim Burton 's work , so I was really excited to see these online short films . Well , they were n't at all what I had expected.<br /><br />I do n't really know what exactly it is I do n't like . I guess they 're just sort of dull . The sound bothers me , and most of the characters , although I loved Roy the Toxic Boy , and Stainboy.<br /><br />The Match Girl episode probably bugged me the most , although it was pretty funny.<br /><br />I also do n't like the way some of the characters die . Like how Match Girl basically set the gas station on fire , or how the Girl Who Stares died , in general . Roy 's death was amusing , surprisingly . Death by a car freshener . Very original ;-) That made me laugh so hard ... <br /><br />There are some things that are n't appropriate for kids . Just some language and gore . That 's about all I have to say ! 3/10
0 The story of the film was as simple minded as its morality : Go find a girl , marry her , live with her happily ever after . Though the film had some fine moments and turns , most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline.<br /><br />The Baptist / Mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about , probably intentionally . A more interesting story would have been a mixed couple.<br /><br />If you wanna see a film which does n't need too much concentration , which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values ( besides the modern tolerance stuff ;-) ) , you will be fine with this film . Might be shown at a family - home - evening ...
0 Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists . New family moves in , cue the overwritten dialog , mediocre acting , green jello salad with shredded carrots , and every other ' inside Mormon joke ' known to man . Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie . Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there . You 'll be much better off watching Hess 's other movies ( Napoleon Dynamite , etc .. ) than trying to sit through this one . The acting is mediocre . Jared Hess has had his hands on much more quality films like " Saints and Soldiers " , and " Napoleon Dynamite " . I would recommend both movies over this groaner .
0 This movie was awful . I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through . I did n't get the point of the movie . What was the point of this movie ? The soundtrack was bad , acting was bad and the story uninspiring . The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting . There was no chemistry among any of the cast members . I do n't know this for a fact , but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers . The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot . That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie . I would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie . I want those two hours back ! If you want to watch good , funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons , watch Napoleon Dynamite instead .
0 The late 80 's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings . Renny Harlin 's superbly gritty and moody " Prison " got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling ; it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior " The Chair , " John Saxon 's enjoyably trashy " Death House , " the passable psycho picture " Destroyer , " and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium . < br /><br />Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp Alex ( the hugely unappealing Nicholas Celozzi ) go to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up - and - coming rock star Sammy Mitchell ( blandly played by Toni Basil of " Hey Micky " fame ) . Alex 's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree , thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter.<br /><br />Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg , with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere ( the film was shot on location in the dismal , rusty , rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island ) , " Slaughterhouse rock " nonetheless just does n't cut it as a solid , effective fright feature . This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters , a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing . The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more , with onetime " Playboy " playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo . Dimitri Logothetis ' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style , but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy , horrendously sophomoric silliness , and , most damagingly , Ted Landon 's sloppy , inconsistent , overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far - fetched story even remotely plausible . In other words , this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn - out cinematic jail sentence .
0 The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is . " Slaughterhouse Rock " is by far the worst horror film that I have ever seen , a title previously held by " Urban Legends : Final Cut " . From its opening scene I could tell it 's going to be really bad , but I was so bored that I could n't care less . This film contains laughable acting , especially by the guy who 's tormented in his dreams , incredible as in not credible plot twists , and some of the crappiest music I 've heard , and I 'm living in a period when the likes of Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the air waves . The biggest problem with " Slaughterhouse Rock " is that it 's not funny . One would a film as dull and boring and so NOT scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one - liners here and there , but no . We have Tormented Guy 's self - centered friend trying to be funny , but came across as annoying instead . ( spoiler ) And please , do tell me , who in this crazy world is insane and self - loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night ? No one ! If you 're going to make a horror movie , at least make it believable . This one is anything but .
0 The storyline is absurd and lame , also sucking are performances and the dialogue , is hard to keep your Eyes open . I advise you to have a caffeine - propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple Gore - effects . Why they bring Alcatraz in?In this case , becomes increasingly difficult to swallow . All the while , i wondered who this film aimed for?Chock full of lame subplots ( such as the Cannibalism US Army - captain)This is low - grade in every aspect . BTW this Movie is banned in Germany ! !
0 Well after three times through I still have no idea what this movie is about because , quite honestly , it failed to generate any real interest or concern . But here it goes : A bunch of too old to be teen Teen Actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980 's fashions ( did WE look like that too ? ? ) decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned Alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off POLTERGEIST , THE EVIL DEAD , and Freddy Kreuger in one fell swoop . The dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin . Good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt , and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget . Mine are usually pretty lame : Girls , model space ships , blowing things up with a bazooka , etc.<br /><br />Once on the Alcatraz island they find themselves in a Slasher movie , and meet up with Tony Basil , who can not help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew ( complete with a smoke machine for that 1980 's smoky haze infused light look , which I kind of miss ) . And such reminded me that Ms. Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances . This of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about . It sort of happens , and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side . But since the film is n't really interesting , you 'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time , the movie will keep ending , and you 'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again , dammit ... < br /><br />*SOME * 1980 's Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing : Umberto Lenzi 's GHOSTHOUSE , CHOPPING MALL & it 's Killbots , the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over - the - top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind . They are films that , like them or not , demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or T&A , and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the TV instead of your keyboard . I am sure that HELL ISLAND ( as the British version I glommed onto is titled ) does indeed have some good stuff in there , but frankly I do n't care . And nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that does n't inspire admiration , some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it . The film is content with simpering away 80-whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance , but no dice.<br /><br />There is some offbeat production design going on , the use of lighting is striking at times , and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980 's Teen Horror interested . The rest of you be warned though : YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT IN 1987 , and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen . Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you are n't stuck with the damn thing : Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days , what with the world coming to an end & all ...
0 College student Alex Gardner ( Nicholas Celozzi ) is plagued by nightmares of a cellar - dwelling ghoul at Alcatraz . He dreams of cutting off his own hand , spitting up a worm , a ghoul ripping open his chest and being roasted over an open fire . After his friends see him levitating " 6 feet " over his bed , a helpful , occult - obsessed teacher ( Donna Denton ) suggests that they sneak into Alcatraz to face his fears . Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand!<br /><br />The group become stranded , Alex 's brother Richard ( Tom Reilly ) becomes possessed and starts killing everyone . Toni Basil of " Mickey " fame shows up as the helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell , lead singer of the group " Bodybag " . She teaches Alex how to levitate out of his body and does a rock music dance intercut with repeat nightmare footage to pad out the running time . All of the victims show up as wisecracking ghosts a la the Griffin Dunne character in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON . The script is full of plot holes , cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy . Good FX work and cool opening credits ( both by Ernest D. Farino ) are the only things gaining any merit . Basil and Devo ( " Whip It " ) do some songs on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Score : 2 out of 10
0 This was one of the most boring " horror " movies that I have ever seen . A college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at Alcatraz . Trying to deliver a mix of " Nightmare on Elm Street " and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video , this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story . Although , being such a bad , and often laughable movie ( dig those mullets and the terrible dialog ) , it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Do n't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction , Fanatasy , and Horror , or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack , or that Tony Basil has a part in the film . It is a giant disaster , though one with a small cult following ( see the other IMDb comments for this film ) .
0 Hearing such praise about this play , I decided to watch it when I stumbled across it on cable . I do n't see how this " elivates " women and their " struggles " by focusing on the topic at hand . I guess if you have an interest in stories about women 's private parts and how it affects their lives , then this is for you . Otherwise , it 's rather dull and boring . If anything , I found it a bit degrading.<br /><br />I inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well . So , it 's not just a guy " not getting it " .
0 I saw one of the stage performances in Denver and have never been less impressed . The word " vagina " says it all . A body part . Nothing shocking here . I could say to my doctor , " My left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis " or " My vagina hurts after cycling " with equal or more social commentary . It could be the " Tricep Monologues " for all the entertainment or radical comment I heard . The monologues were dull but delivered with drama , the topics were outdated , and I was alternately bored and annoyed . Once I think I laughed but apparently it was n't when I was supposed to . Surely this is n't really a hit . Oh , and spoilers : there was a LESBIAN ! - oh , wait , maybe not , come to think of it . And Inappropriate Fondling ! And a Crack Mama ! That about covers it .
0 Although this seems to be quite an old show ( 2002 ) , I watched my first ever episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show . . . ever.<br /><br />I am not one for placing comments but I was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to , and I am only assuming that this was their target audience , children under 12 years old or people with a less than average IQ.<br /><br />The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines , tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship , family , religion and politics ! ! ! .<br /><br />Basic story that they covered in the episode : Frat House hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol - Death Turns out to be Senators son who wants FBI to investigate . Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because Senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said ' no ' to mean mulit millionaire . Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ( ex - girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie , disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience , Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son , he gives money freely to lots of broke students ) . All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is ' at that age ' and has a crush on a boy , who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty , but only to dump him because the ' in ' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him . Do n't worry , she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the ' in ' girls drop her , Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on ( I was almost sick at this point).<br /><br />This ' drama ' gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is . . . your gon na laugh at this , i sure did . . . < br /><br />It is one of the Frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an International terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral . . . . . . . < br /><br />The characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard Anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain < br /><br />Why the writers of this show have tried to pack in EVERY eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line . Watching this show is like watching ' Last Action Hero ' with Arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick , except Arnie is a better actor ( wow , never thought there would be a day that i would say that ! ! ) < br /><br />In the words of the Simpsons beloved character ' comic book guy ' . . . . < br /><br />WORST TV SHOW . . . . . EVER .
0 When watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying . First of all , the storyline of each episode is very predictable , the writers must have used every cliché possible , you can guess not only the general plot , but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character , making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there . On the top of it all comes the " message " of the show , that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other , be better man and better citizens , all done in the most ostensible manner . The actors , as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that , will use a limited set of acting skills : the " I am a good carrying person " smile , the concerned look and the " victory is ours " body posture , while the bad guys have the " I 'm a bad one " frowning and the " you caught me " look , followed by the " I 'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society " head banding ( this kind of also sums up the general development of each show ) . True story or not , the show is garbage , yet another proof that producers do n't give a s**t about viewers , that we are all thought to be idiots . Well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you .
0 I found " The Arab Conspiracy " in a bargain bin and thought I 'd uncovered a lost treasure . Folks , there 's a reason why you do n't hear much about this film . The plot is muddy , the pacing is slow , Cornelia Sharpe is about as vivacious as plain , cold tofu , and the ending leaves you flat . Not even Sean Connery can save this one .
0 The movie had a lot of potential , unfortunately , it came apart because of a weak / implausible story line , miscasting , and general lack of content / substance . One of the very obvious flaws was that Sean Connery , who played an Arab man , did n't know how to pronounce his own Arab name ! This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details . The quality of acting was uniformly well below average . < br /><br />Movie 's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end ; and a french song ( I do n't recall the title ) . Overall , it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast .
0 This is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time . Remember the all - around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the Watergate and a little later ? Most movies trying to cash in on made - for - TV ' o so powerful , o so mind numbing ' conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel - gazing attitude.<br /><br />I was never a fan of The Conversation which I find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe . I mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes . Lots of questions unanswered , lots of dis - communication ... Well this takes at least Bergman to build a movie about such un - visual bases.<br /><br />The Next Man is a perfect example of its time : one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him . Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole does n't get any better . In fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up ' watcha that ' murders without ever advancing any storyline . Pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer 's eyes .
0 I 'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching , but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance . The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe , looking rather attractive , and the fact that this film is REALLY short.<br /><br />The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film . None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone . I 'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film , but he should have definitely passed on this one.<br /><br />The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die - hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he 's done . Save this one for last though.<br /><br />Well , if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review ( or any of the other reviews on this site ) , then I hope you enjoy it more than I did . Thanks for reading .
0 PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made , unedited , sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start . It is just another Mafia - based ' comedy ' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating.<br /><br />Joe Maloni ( Paul Sorvino ) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control . His personal assistant Mario ( Anthony DeSando ) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny . Maloni has whacked one of his debtors ( who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton ) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband 's debt by being Maloni 's ' hit man ' . Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni 's assignments , electing instead to transport her ' whackees ' to Florida to hide at her brother James ' house until she can figure out what to do next . This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B , Plan A being to kill them ! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters.<br /><br />Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes , but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch . Paul Sorvino is , well , the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films . The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick , pratfall fashion imaginable . What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone . Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms : had this flimsy story been compressed into a half - hour gig it might have had a chance . Grady Harp
0 Simply put , this is the worst movie since " Police Academy : Mission to Moscow " ( if you liked that movie you will probably like this one).<br /><br />What were they thinking ? Some ideas should stay just that , an idea . The fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense.<br /><br />What was so bad about it I hear you ask . One word ... EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Cost to Hire : $ 4.50 Cost in Time to Watch : 89 Minutes < br /><br />I want a refund on both !
0 Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 < br /><br />Is she even in business ? If someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap , she 's up for the most Fortunate Person Of Ever award . This movie sucks to no END ... It never ceases to amaze me what the turn into movies ... and the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit ? Seriously ? I can write better crap than this in my sleep.<br /><br />OK , so how many lines to I have to type ? I do n't get this at all . I guess I"m a newbie . I guess I do n't understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to say ... or a quota ? Seriously , I do n't care if you have a one word sentence ... or even a one word response . I mean , c'mon ? < br /><br />Thanks ... is this enough , finally?<br /><br />This movie is worthless .
0 This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild , and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard . But all in all , the movie is incredibly stupid , with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer , only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes . Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian lady ghost , and has no idea why ( and neither does the viewer ) . As other murders are committed , he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found , and this ghost still haunts him for some reason . Not only is the plot completely stupid , the lady ghost is more funny than anything , especially when she suddenly flies across the city , like Wonder Woman . And the ending makes little sense , in fact , the whole movie makes little sense , and I ca n't recommend it at all . If it did n't take itself so serious , I would think it was supposed to be a black comedy . Outside of " Bright Future " this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I have seen yet .
0 The Japenese sense of pacing , editing and musical score must be different than American tastes , but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work.<br /><br />Someone in Hollywood needs to re - make this movie and I think it would be a big hit . The story is interesting and creepy . There 's something about the edges of the city , gritty policemen , earthquakes , sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating . However , this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter.<br /><br />I do have to say that the " sixth - sense " effect was in full force in this movie , and that was evident from the very beginning.<br /><br />As it stands , only the die - hard Japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh - so - boring movie .
0 I 've seen about four other Japanese horror films and they were n't too impressive . However , I could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way.<br /><br />Not here , no way . This is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening . When he finds a suspect to question , the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost . Then , the ghost starts to follow the detective around FOR A REASON THAT IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND TAKES UP MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVIE.<br /><br />Bad enough ? Oh no . The film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who do n't have much to do with the story . I 've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective . Not the case here.<br /><br />Also , whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends . For example , there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and ... then it just cuts to another scene . I 'm aware that this can be a dramatic effect . That 's definitely not the intention here . It 's just bad editing.<br /><br />Finally , there 's the " ghost " who just screams in a way that 's not scary or unintentionally funny . It 's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie.<br /><br />All of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming . Then after one of them , the movie is over . At that point , a wave of confusion swept over the audience as I could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time . Someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued . It was better than the whole film . Simply put , AVOID .
0 speaking solely as a movie , i did n't really liked it . not because there were no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film , actually that was what kept me watching it.<br /><br />i did n't like it because the acting was shady , his " friends " are all happy and then they 're mad , but you have no idea why ; then they take distinct roles , one is the believer , other is the antagonist , but they never really make the point ! also , the lighting was terrible and i 'm just mentioning technical issues.<br /><br />in a few words , i thing the movie could have just had a " ok i 'm outta here ! " from some characters . like the lady who does n't want to hear his version of the bible.<br /><br />about the story itself , everyone is free to write about what they want , and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination . i credit the book author for that , hence , my 4/10.<br /><br />so , in the end , hear the man 's story believe it or not , just do n't spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says , and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you do n't believe him.<br /><br />Coherence.<br /><br />thanks for reading ;)
0 Republic pictures comes late in the game to the " werewolf " er Werecat genre . The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts . He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller . The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents , something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a " catman " . Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead . Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer does n't know if he 's the killer or not.<br /><br />Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed . There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections . The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer , he 's the most interesting thing in this film . despite its short running time ( just over an hour ) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it . As good as the talk is , I just wished someone would do something . When it finally did happen , in the closing minutes , it was too little too late .. <br /><br />Take a pass .
0 The special effects of this movie are , especially for its time , laughable and used in such an over - emphasized way that you ca n't deny their terrible existance.<br /><br />The acting redefines the term " terrible overacting " at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul , where julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine " bad".<br /><br />***spoilers***<br /><br />The charm in this movie can be found in two things : First is the excellent casting of Carel " Lurch " Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt , who can sense where and when people will die and is always there.<br /><br />The second are original finds , the combination SF - Western is obviously original , if terrible , but other finds are more original , like the gunman Zack Stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots ( though his acting falls short here).<br /><br />Overal ... don't see this movie , except if you love that ol' hunk - o - brutal Carel Struycken , as any self - respecting Dutchman should .
0 You get 5 writers together , have each write a different story with a different genre , and then you try to make one movie out of it . It 's action , it 's adventure , it 's sci - fi , it 's western , it 's a mess . Sorry , but this movie absolutely stinks . 4.5 is giving it an awefully high rating . That said , it 's movies like this that make me think I could write movies , and I can barely write .
0 Seeing this movie , as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic ( which lists it as " Dangerous Female " ) , can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 Bogart - Astor version . Ricardo Cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk . I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will ; they made him the actor he was . The women are all good , but no better than that . Well , Una Merkel is a little better . More interesting are the " original " Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman , who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set - changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles , Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet . Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake ; here , Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley ( ! ) ca n't . < br /><br />This movie does n't exactly stink ; it lies there like a big slice of ham . Its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the ' 41 " Falcon " do n't just happen . On the 1-to-10 scale I rate it a 4 , mainly for the camera work and the supporting players .
0 Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately . Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid , redundant pulp - horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down . Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal ' Crocodile ' ( directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper ) and ' Lake Placid ' . Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously . The saltwater - crocodile supposedly is 90 years old , over 30 ft long ( ! ) and it kills for fun ! During the film , he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer - dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark - congested area . The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location . Even though it 's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this , the lagoons and nature looks marvelous . Every other aspect is simply disastrous . There 's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable . The dialogues are downright painful to listen to ! You wo n't believe some of the lines these actors have to say ! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they 're not that stupid ! Early in the film , one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a ' mechanical toy ' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg 's great white shark . The visual effects in ' Blood Surf ' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress . I wo n't say too much about the acting since it 's secondary in flicks like this . The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast . You guessed right : Blood Surf is a very bad film . So bad it becomes fun again . But ' funny ' for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended .
0 Standard " paint - by - numbers " monster fare , filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big - creature movies . It 's like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them , which were shuffled , and dealt . Whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script . < br /><br />Characters are so cliché - ridden , that you can play a game of " Guess who ends up as a monster meal " after less than ten minutes into the movie , and probably get every single one right -- including the order that they will get devoured . Many of the characters are so obnoxious , that you root for the creature to shut them up . Some of the main characters include : a Billy Idol clone who surfs with sharks , a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls , a Capt . Ahab guy with a vendetta , and Ahab 's girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar . Oh , and a big , big beast in need of anger management therapy.<br /><br />Along the way , people argue a lot , pretty girls run around with wet t - shirts , couples make out on exotic beaches , explosions occur , ruins of a shrine appear , and greasy - faced pirates drop by . < br /><br />Amusing , for the most part , but one thing bothered me : the callousness by characters when other people were killed . After one violent demise , they make one - liner jokes . I could almost hear rim shots.<br /><br />Overall , OK , if you have 90 minutes to waste , and you want to laugh at a so - bad - it's - good - movie . Otherwise , you may want to skip this one .
0 Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days . They 've been making these lame " Jaws "- copies since the 70s , it 's not like they 're getting any more well - liked . The idea is still exactly the same . So we have an animal that starts murdering people . First it takes down some secondary characters , then it starts attacking the main characters , usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous , who usually plays a specialist . One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow , usually with an explosion . Then , we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive , or has laid eggs , etc . etc . " Krocodylus " basically uses the same overused ideas , and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation . Unless you count the fact that the " specialist " is a captain in this one variation , in that case your standards are pretty low . It 's funny that he 's played by Duncan Regehr though , he like totally used to be Zorro . Hell I 'll give it a bonus point for that .
0 A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers , who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark - infested waters . As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters , I thought this might be my kind of movie ... it was n't ! ! ! This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it ! It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke , in the final scene it goes after the main characters * rolling * , the feet are obviously waving in the air ! It looks ridiculous ! Good for a laugh though . If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors , the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile , it would be at least worth a laugh , but it gets worse : I 'd guess , the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was , so they though up the old idea of " sex sells " ... Totally , i mean TOTALLY without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast . And somewhere towards the beginning there 's some kind of meaningless " makeout " . This is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me . It 's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish ! If you are seeking for a real waste of time : watch this movie ! ! !
0 An MTV - style film crew consisting of American T.V. programme producer Zack Zardine ( Matt Borlenghi ) his camerawoman , the Australian Cecily ( Kate Fisher ) and two surfer ' dudes ' named Bog Hall ( Dax Miller ) and Jeremy ( Joel West ) arrive on some nice looking island somewhere , it 's not actually revealed where . The crew plan to shoot an expose on ' bloodsurfing ' which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports . Surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks , just to see if they can out - surf them without being eaten . Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco ( Cris Vertido ) and his wife Melba ( Susan Africa ) . Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo - Cay . Sonny , Melba and their daughter Lemmya ( Maureen Larrazabal ) take them in their boat . Soon after arriving and having already shot some ' bloodsurfing ' footage Sonny , Melba and Lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say ' owns ' the island . The boat is sunk . Zack , Cecily , Bog and Jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives . However , after a run in with some , erm well I do n't really know what they are . Pirates ? Drug smugglers ? Revolutionairies ? Fat ugly people who just do n't like being with other people ? Who knows ? And more importantly who cares ? Not me that 's for sure . Anyway , after escaping from these guys who look like pirates , they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks ( Duncan Regehr ) and his girl Arty ( Taryn Reif as Tara Reif ) . The film crew believe they have been saved . Little do they know that the crocodile and Captain Dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew are n't going to stop him . Captain Dirks heads back to Lilo - Cay for a final showdown with the giant man - eating crocodile.<br /><br />Directed by James D.R. Hickox this is one awful film , but it 's still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile ( 2000 ) . Everything about this film sucks . The script by Sam Bernard and Robert L.Levy is terrible , extremely slow as the crocodile is n't even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time I was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and Levy . The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well , within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive . The crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over , there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it 's movements as the water splashes become huge ! The CGI shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch . There is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using CGI to digitally remove the actors legs , again it looks terrible . There is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off . There is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex , plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye . There are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too , in one sequence Cecily is filming Bog and Jeremy ' bloodsurfing ' but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time , and surely that is the whole point of her shot ? When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots , in one shot the angle of the line looks like it 's coming from the sky , in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface . I could carry on , like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it 's so smart as this film tries to make out ? But I would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if I listed everything that was wrong with this film , so I wo n't . I hated this film , but rather scarily it 's still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film . Definitely one to avoid .
0 " It 's not like that big mechanical toy " , says a character early on , commenting on " Jaws " . Well , " Blood Surf " would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the " Jaws " series . In other words , the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE . Acting and directing are not much better , either ; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble - gum commercial than to a horror movie . The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre , but for the audience too . Saying you " liked " this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap , further destroying the poor horror genre . ( * 1/2 )
0 Oh God , I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve , ( do n't ask how ) I may have been young , but I was n't stupid . Anyone could see that this is a bad movie , nasty , gross , unscary and very silly . I 've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland , I 've seen better performances at a school play , And I 've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo , where they do nothing but sit in the water , ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia . A handful of ambitious young people , are trying out a new water sport , surfing in shark filled waters . It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water . After they learn what , they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman , who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years , the best of which is Lake Placid , and the worse of which is its sequel . Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think , with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there , resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year . Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature , but a good hour and a half of the viewer 's life . Unless you really want to see it , avoid Blood Surf .
0 ... which is n't exactly a ringing endorsement . Overall , " DinoCroc " was a much better movie . Sure , in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss - bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc . But the special effects in " DinoCroc " were better , the plot lines were better , and the acting was better . Here are the problems with " Blood Surf " -- 1 ) the killer crocodile looks like a kid 's model with a retractable jaw . 2 ) the plot is ridiculous . Matt Borlenghi & Co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island , in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group . Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film . And 3 ) there 's not enough croc time . There are a couple of redeeming qualities of " Blood Surf " -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie . But if you 're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi / killer crocodile movie , skip this one and fire up " DinoCroc " instead .
0 Some might scoff , but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films . This misses out on all fronts.<br /><br />A bunch of young people -- women with heaving breasts and continuously wet T - Shirts , naturally -- go to film " blood surfing " and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile.<br /><br />Not only was the croc obviously fake , but some of the props [ notice the boat hitting the reef in particular ] look like they 've come out of thunderbirds!<br /><br />No good , from start to finish . Do n't see it !
0 I never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious , but alas I was wrong . Terrible acting , terrible plot , terrible effects . The Crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex / killing scene all in one , that was a bad move from the word go . It was truly shocking and that is not a compliment ! How can someone make this film , watch it back and then actually say " Yeah , that s a good movie . People will watch that " If you have n't seen it I beg you DON'T BOTHER :-(
0 * * SPOILERS**<br /><br />This is one BAD movie . Seriously . Acting in absolutely horrible , the FX are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful . But hey , its so bad that its fun watching ! The script is SO bad that its enjoyable ! You just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as " I guess that s what you call CROCTEASING . " as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile . I mean COME ON that s funny cause its so bad ! It has such horrible jokes that they 're funny ! But after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap . I really started to fall asleep . Trust me though , the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time . Though I have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do . Heh heh mindless movie , which HAS to be nominated for the MST3 K line ! !
0 Oh , CGI . A blessing when used properly . A sin with it 's used by people who have no idea what their doing . Sadly , that 's not the only thing that 's used poorly in this umpteen Jaws rip - off.<br /><br />Ok , anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things . 1 : I like low - budget horror movies . And 2 : If there is a cute guy in said low - budget movie , I 'll usually point them out . So , let 's just get this out of the way right now . This is one low - budget horror movie I did n't like . The acting , for the most part , is horrible , effects laughable , and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I 've witnessed this year . As far as the resident cute boy ... Dax Miller ( Bog ) wins that prize hands down . This boy is hot ! And surprisingly , he 's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt ... he can actually act ( well , as much as he can in this odious film ) . Now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way , let 's get on with it.<br /><br />In Cliff Notes version , here 's the story ( do n't worry , I 'll try not to give anything away) ... <br /><br />A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers ( established cute boy and his buddy ) who surf with sharks . Unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island . Croc shows up , mayhem ensues , and people are eaten . Roll end credits.<br /><br />As I said earlier , this film pretty much blows . It started pretty well , but soon devolved into being silly and stupid . A main character becomes lunch ( in a rather humorous way ) , and our remaining heros utter one - liners at the victims expense . Also , if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water , what 's with all the sharks around ? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat , I do n't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around . The FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see . The CGI is horrendous , and they 've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs . Attention , filmmakers . National Geographic . Discovery Store . The Croc Hunter . They know what crocodiles look like . You obviously did n't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film . And what 's with the pirate / drug pusher gang ? Did you just need another reason to rip off a woman 's top ? < br /><br />It 's funny how we get little sub - genres in the movie world . With Alligator and it 's sequels , Lake Placid , Crocodile , and now Blood Surf , it now looks like " over - sized crocodile / alligator " movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster . Alligator was good . Lake Placid was good . I even thought Tobe Hooper 's Crocodile was good . Blood Surf , sucked.<br /><br />My grade : D-
0 Upon viewing Tobe Hooper 's gem , Crocodile , in 2000 , I developed a great interest in the college / crocodile niche of the exploitation / monster genre . I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness . If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts . With Ed writing the scripts , and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer , all we 'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />While Tobe Hooper 's crocky opus referenced his own movies , Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies . See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions / homages?/rip - offs to Jaws , Temple of Doom , Indiana Jones ' Last Crusade , The Convent , Godzilla 2000 , and any James Bond movie . Also , try to find the ready - for - tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.<br /><br />I was disappointed the crock did n't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism ... or crocky appreciation , but the quasi - Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach . Perhaps , in the coming years , we 'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset . Or hopefully , a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero - G monkey / midget / crocodile bloodshed.<br /><br />All - in - all , the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me .
0 You , know , I can take the blood and the sex , but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in . Someone get that girl some pasta before it 's too late!<br /><br />And you know , it 's just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it 's ripping off.<br /><br />I gave this one a 2 , just because it 's marginally better than Tobe Hooper 's CROCODILE .
0 The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it.<br /><br />In every other way , this film is a very lame rip - off of Jaws , Lake Placid , and Alligator , with a little bit of Godzilla ( 1998 ) thrown in.<br /><br />As is standard for a 1990's - style horror movie , the two non - starring females each take their clothes off at least once . The female lead does n't , since she obviously has a better agent . < br /><br />The whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing , in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark - infested waters . In this film , a giant salt - water crocodile also happens to be in the area . People get eaten . The movie ends.<br /><br />I do n't mind a bad horror movie , but I really hate a dull bad horror movie , which this definitely is .
0 This film is really terrible . terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life . Special effects are so terrible . The acting was n't convincing.<br /><br />Its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about " blood surfing " . Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday . The sharks do n't look real . The crocodile is even worse , and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature , but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it . The deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time.<br /><br />A pointless , terrible film that s not worth seeing ! !
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * If one were to review the film based on the premise alone , one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick . The plot is as follows . A group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing . ( I live in South Africa so it was released as " Blood Surf . " ) Admittedly , this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which , if it were explored further , could have improved the movie somewhat . However , this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt - water crocodile.<br /><br />The script is absolutely terrible . A good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film , no one seems to give a damn . The most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature . Another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself . They introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short film.<br /><br />The acting can be said to be mediocre . It probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from . All in all there is n't one person who made a terrible impact on me . Every single person seemed to be a watered - down caricature and in this way , not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me.<br /><br />The crocodile itself is said to be huge , over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film . The crocodile 's death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one 's stomach turn . With a huge cry of bravado , the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily - placed spike at the bottom of this said hill.<br /><br />All in all , I would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be . What probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low - budgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie .
0 Why , o ' WHY ! ... did I pick this one up ? Well ... i needed a no - brainer in the summer heat , and the cover looked cool.<br /><br />Of course I should 've known better . This is a really , really bad movie . And it gets embarasing when the makers know it 's bad , and try cover it up by adding some sexy / beautiful women , and some sex - scenes to it . Well , folks ... it does'nt cut it , does it!<br /><br />If you WOULD like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very , very good , well - played and funny : go rent Lake Placid ! ( that is an order )
0 This film is awful . The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI . The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge . The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive . It is mostly a photo - shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen . This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed , and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci - Fi Channel movies.<br /><br />Aside from the terrible lack of special effects , the cast is composed of the typical low - cost actors who probably work as Waiters / Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks . Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building ( and crushing Kate ) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water . No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects . At least there is honor among crocodiles .
0 Blood Surf AKA Krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller , Taryn Reif , Kate Fischer , Duncan Regehr , Joel West , Matt Borlenghi , Maureen Larrazabal , Cris Vertido , Susan Africa , Archie Adamos , Rolando Santo Domingo , and Malecio Amayao . The acting by the actors is fairly good . The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed fairly good as well . Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end . This is a fairly thrilling film . If you the the cast in the film , Monsters , Giant Animal films , Horror , Thrillers , Mystery , and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today !
0 I expected a bad movie , and got a bad movie . But I could n't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was . I do n't even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about . Is not about blood surfing , but a big a$$ crocodile . They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws , but Spielberg was wise and did n't show the shark until the end . Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times , and it 's the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen , and they do n't try to hide it . If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid . < br /><br />The director had an opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie , but he had to make a bad b - monster movie . He had the chance to make an original surf movie , but he wanted to make a monster movie . So you have understand how bad this movie is , does it have some good parts ? Not really , it got some nudity , and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie . The acting is n't half bad either , and Kate Fischer looks good . Too bad she does n't take her top off . The lead actors are n't bad either . They had some potential . The location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes . The blame is on the untalented writer and director . The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen , and the script is really badly written , and the director got no talent what so ever , and not much of a fantasy either.<br /><br />Don't watch it . Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer . It is n't worth it . Watch Sirens to watch Kate nude , and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile action.<br /><br />3/10 because I 'm in a good mood , and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked , and Kate looks good ( but is bad actress,)and Dex Miller , Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sh#t they had to work with .
0 This is one of the few episodes ( if not the only one ) with an indisputable error in its storytelling . While handling the Ralphie situation Christopher states that he has heard about Pie - O - My 's death in the fire accident . This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie . There is however no way Chris could have heard about the accident . Who should have told him and when ? By the time he is torn out of his delirium by Tony 's call nobody else was informed . Tony knows that - which makes it even worse ! Hearing Christopher talk about Pie- O - My 's death could therefore only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself has set the fire . Given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the DVD I really wonder none of them realized the problem there . The story just does n't work that way . Unnecessary to add that I 'm a huge fan of the Sopranos . Otherwise , I certainly would n't care .
0 not to long after Jeff Jarrett left the WWF for good he spoke of that night . Owen Hart and him where good friends and both 2nd generation wrestlers .

0 Ever since I was eight years old I have been a big wrestling fan . It did n't matter what federation I watched . WWE , WCW , USWA . To me the action is all I watched it for.<br /><br />May 23rd 1999 . That was my 19 birthday . I ordered Over the Edge and I was just expecting another pay per view . But this time . I was wrong . Instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of Canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong . Not much you can do to change the situation . But what happened affter Owens death made me very mad.<br /><br />Rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if Owens death never happened.<br /><br />I got ta tell you . Vince Mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made.<br /><br />And this crap with saying Owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going . Give me a break . When someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it . That s like a police officer shooting a robber or a mugger with a run and then just leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the mans life never mattered.<br /><br />But no matter what happens . Owen will be missed and thanks for the memories for all the times you gave us .
0 A concept with potential , and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together , but ... <br /><br />Rudolph 's glowing nose did n't require the " explanation " offered in this film - much like The Force in the Star Wars films did n't need the explanation of " medichlorians in the bloodstream . " But mainly , the film left me cold because of Winterbolt 's over - complicated plot to destroy Santa . He 's got the power to put suggestions into people 's minds , so why does he do things in such a roundabout way ? Breaking the magic of Rudolph 's nose , framing Rudolph , threatening to melt the Frosty family ... The comedically exaggerated plots of Pinky and the Brain and " Phineas and Ferb 's " Dr. Doofenshmirtz ( which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs ) seem simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt 's , which we 're expected to take somewhat seriously.<br /><br />There is a particularly ( and amusingly ) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy , like boomerangs . I understand if they do n't want to have guns being shot in a family film , but then why have guns in the first place ?
0 Original Claymation Rudolph : Pretty good . Original Frosty cartoon : Needs a little work , but could be worse . But Frosty and Rudolph together on the Fourth of July ? C'mon ! Give me a BREAK ! ! ! This was one movie that should n't have been made . It was bad . It did n't really go for any holiday in particular , except July 4 . That made it especially bad since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season . And any movie can be ruined by too much singing . The frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was . The movie tried mixing two familiar Chirstmastime characters with an American traditional holiday ( which almost seems to " limit " it to America ) , too many pointless songs , and a lousy plotline . The result ? A bad movie that ca n't really be watched at any time of year . I would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph .
0 Quite simply this should n't have been made . It 's predictable and clichéd . The on screen chemistry which made the first " My Girl " so captivating is nowhere to be found here , and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced . The writing also leaves much to be desired , some of the ' memorable ' lines such as " earpeircing a barbaric custom " are just shocking . Where " My Girl " provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments , like so many sequels " My Girl 2 " tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience , and fails miserably . Maybe i 'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was , but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up . Surely this has to come close to " Son of the mask " as being one of the worst sequels of all time . In both cases , the old saying rings true ; " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " .
0 If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974 , this is the movie for you . But you 'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins , too ( see my remarks on My Girl 1 for the reference).<br /><br />Indulgent admission : I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance , having just viewed its predecessor . But as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother , My Girl 2 made me look , with its theme of searching for mother.<br /><br />Put another way , anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with My Girl 2 , but relating to a protagonist who asks , like so many adoptees , " who 's my mama " ? And if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe , I 'll be sure to make my own movie about it.<br /><br />People are listless . Movies should not be listless . My Girl 2 ( like My Girl 1 ) is just ... listless.<br /><br />Avoid unless you 're a complete sap who 's comforted by a series of small annoyances .
0 I think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like " My Girl " . " My Girl " was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters ( Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J. ) dies . The story was over after the first movie . I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on . That was senseless !
0 I just do n't see how a Concorde - New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad . It just boggles the mind , does n't it?<br /><br />Well , let 's make no mistake about it . " Munchie Strikes Back " is indeed a bad film . Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries . For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film , he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son . The mom 's problem ( her main problem at least ) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks ... to the not - so - tiny tune of $ 20,000 . Ouch . She ca n't come up with the money because she just got fired . OK ... JUST is the key word in that sentence . What the ... ? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck ? Maybe it would 've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ... ya think?<br /><br />Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess ... but there is n't a limit on the number of wishes you can make ! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was " borrowing " it from . The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating . A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times . Sadly , those dumb parents watching the game do n't think it 's at all strange . Hmm.<br /><br />Anyway , I 'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is . You 'll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie - Anne Down , playing the mother , kicks a dog which is yapping at her . Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer . " Munchie Strikes Back " 's credits promised another film to follow entitled , I believe , " Munchie Hangs Ten " . To date , the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force . Heh . 1/10
0 Terrible story , poor acting and no humour at all ( apart from the final joke at the end)<br /><br />Some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home . Supposed to be a kiddies movie , but even they will not be amused by this terrible film
0 I saw this movie , and at times , I was unnerved believing this movie ' saw me . ' Munchie sullies the ' farce ' for years to come . Re - watch Star Wars , Don't - watch Munchie.<br /><br />As a responsible parent ( I 'm speaking to those who are parents now ) , I ( you ) would not let my ( your ) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo - occult . To insinuate Munchie is satanic , to a co - viewer , is likely to illicit a chilled ' duh . ' He is fiendish , alien , rodential , and wholly malevolent - like the Bogey man made flesh , invisible to adults , tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford ( without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship ) . He is a peddler of easy answers , and false ideals . He is everything the morally conscious viewer is not . He is the devil 's own Ron Popeil.<br /><br />I pray ( I mean this literally and figuratively , with an emphasis on the former ) that this movie has not made the format jump to DVD . It is my hope that this type of ' yellow film making ' died an un - mourned death in the cold nights of 1994.<br /><br />Munchie also loves pizza . I forgot to mention that . It comes up a lot .
0 Michael Williams , who works for BBC , finds a somehow impressive Italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled DIABOLICAL ART : A DOCUMENTARY . But since his wife 's mysterious death her daughter , Emily , has been emotionally disturbed , so he goes Spoleto , where the problematic picture is , with her and her nanny , Jill . And there is a Countess , who is also a psychic , and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed . Michael does n't believe her story , but after that Emily has hysterical spasm and Jill is killed ... This Italian film is , of course , almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST , but this one is much cheaper , much simpler , and in a sense , much dirtier . First of all , it should be said this film is full of confusion . For instance , the story shows Emily is a reincarnation of Emilia . But when Emily sees her in the flashbacks , she perceives her exclusively from a third - person 's point of view . But if she is the reincarnation of Emilia , she should and must see the past from nothing but Emilia 's point of view . Confusions of this kind , which the film has many , are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly , rather than ambivalent , to specify its own quasi - Freudian theme , namely , pre - adolescent girl 's one - way incestuous wish . To make matters worse , this film also has characteristic problem ( if not confusion ) ; every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human . Regarding Emily ( or Emilia ) , she is after all a child , and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness . ( And according to the Freudian theory , every girl wants to have her father 's child(ren ) in her own way . In this sense , Emily is not exclusively pathological ; only her way of excluding other women from her father 's love is problematically pathological . But , as I already mentioned , this film per se is too cowardly to be Freudian . ) The problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as Emily is . And because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything can not do anything down - to - earth , and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way . In addition , special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable . Although Stelvio Cipriani 's music is noteworthily beautiful ( indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone ) , the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap B - film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-Italian- horror - film - lovers .
0 This movie started out good , i felt like i was watching an adult version of Seinfeld . Much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters , and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing . All the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny . Dan Cortese was amazing . I loved him in this role . His agent should show this movie to casting agents . Watch the first few scenes and then find something better , or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess . I found this in a bin at a video store . It cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price .
0 A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating . The premise seems simple enough : Yentl , a girl interested in studying the Talmud , wants to go to school . But only boys are allowed to study , so after her father 's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in . She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor , who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass . Hadass ' family learns Avigdor 's brother committed suicide , and the wedding is called off . Yentl , now calling herself Anschel , is then selected to marry Hadass . She does but it is never consummated . Yentl / Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days , and Yentl / Anschel reveals her secret to him . The movie ends with Avigdor returning to ( and marrying ? ) Hadass , and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.<br /><br />The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long , but there are several things that ruin it . For starters , there is the constant SINGING . ( I can already hear the critics shouting . ) Yes , I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers . But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them . The songs become tedious after a while , and there is n't as much dancing as one would expect . Many of the songs are forgettable , with no real memorable lyrics , and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice - over . Only one song stands out from the rest , " Papa Can You Hear Me " . It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes . Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is , so the songs really are n't necessary . < br /><br />Second , Streisand 's makeup , which can be seen during her scenes as a man ( the lipstick , enhanced lashes , and traces of blush are all obvious ) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl / Anschel character , that she is actually serious , and fooling her new friends , colleagues , and even Hadass , into believing she is a man . Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing . There seems to be a contradiction , as her character talks , or rather sings , of how she does n't think she can pull it off , but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men 's clothing . This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they ca n't see the other differences , such as her actions , which are clear giveaways . The facial differences alone can not be included , as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends did n't have a beard or other facial hair . Nevertheless , in the 1900s , if a woman dressed as a man , but wore as much makeup as Streisand 's character did , and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men 's clothing , it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage . Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town , or even the country . Therefore the " feminine " makeup on Streisand does not lend to the character 's credibility , and only weakens the plot . If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful , it should have been scrapped . < br /><br />Thirdly , when Yentl / Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end , we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand 's and only when they learn the " truth " do they become a little wiser . By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom - made vehicle for Streisand to fuel.<br /><br />Lastly , there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film , its plot , or the songs . To those I must respectfully disagree . While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities , I am not a " fan " of her style of singing . However , I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals . There are even some songs of hers that I like , so I am not a " hater " nor have set out to bash her . I have written this review from an honest perspective , from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within . If Streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film , she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented , beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn . This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities , make her appear self - absorbed , and thus turn the film into a laugh - fest unworthy of her fans or audience .
0 This might be the worst film ever made , and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone . Streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study Judaism . The soundtrack is torturous , featuring Barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film . And do n't even get me started on the plot . You will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible . The rampant ego of Streisand , thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to Oscar heights , led to this disaster . I 'm pretty sure the novelist , Isaac Bashevis Singer , hated this film and never forgave Streisand . I ca n't blame him . This movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of ' The Sound of Music ' being played backwards on an old turntable . It 's truly that bad . I 'm amazed that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended .
0 I know , I know , " Plan 9 from Outer Space " is the worst movie , or maybe " Manos , the Hands of Fate . " But I ca n't get worked up over those sock - monkey movies . Of * course * they 're bad . How could they be any good ? But if you 're talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent , the T. rex of all turkeys has to be " Yentl . " All the treacly phoniness , all the self - absorbed asininity , that stains everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964 , reaches its culmination in this movie . From its lonely summit of awfulness , " Yentl " looks back to " A Star is Born " and forward to " The Mirror Has Two Faces . " There is nothing else quite like it . What emotional undertow dragged Streisand out to make this movie I would rather not speculate , and what audience she was playing to I can not possibly imagine , although I 'll bet there 's a nine in ten chance you are n't a member of it.<br /><br />Nobel Prize - winner and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it . It is a tribute to Streisand 's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only did n't commit suicide , but went on to make more awful movies .
0 My personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room . The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is . The single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of " willing suspension of disbelief " . . . it is impossible to do that in this movie .
0 Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story.<br /><br />To have a chance at obtaining an education , Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which is n't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy , anyway . At her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she 's a guy.<br /><br />Don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs ' male friend thinks she 's a man , but pins ' him ' to the ground , sits on top of ' him ' , and looks affectionately into ' his ' eyes .... * snicker*.<br /><br />Mediocre film ; splashy story about nothing particularly interesting .
0 I remember when this piece of trash came out , all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made . Well it could n't have taken that many years ; the play only opened in 1975 , eight years previously . It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh , who probably should have been cast in the film , but NOOOOO ... the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY . AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS ! This film is a total disaster from start to finish . For one thing , Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it . There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah . And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy . I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make - up ; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl . And as if that is not bad enough , she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor ( Mandy Patinkin , whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end ) AND his fiancée ( Amy Irving , who does her usual sleepwalker routine , a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing ) . Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl ; I wo n't even bother to mention the " wedding night " scene.<br /><br />Then there is the music . Nine totally forgettable songs , all sung by Streisand via voice - over ( presumably as a look inside her mind ) , and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard.<br /><br />I wo n't say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here ; some of the visuals are lovely ( Patinkin 's backside especially ) , and she has a good eye for balance . The problem with this movie is that she wo n't get out of her own way . I did not believe her for one second in the title role ; she should NEVER have added the songs , and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes . I was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty - five minutes.<br /><br />Awful , awful , awful .
0 ( Honestly , Barbra , I know it 's you who 's klicking all those " NO"s on my review . 22 times ? ? How many people did you have to instruct to help you out here ? Do n't you have anything better to do , like look at yourself in the mirror all day?)<br /><br />Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was " the best movie I 've seen since ' Citizen Kane ' " . That pretty much says it all - and serves as a dire warning!<br /><br />What are the ingredients for a sure - fire cinematic disaster , and one that will haunt you , never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain ? The ingredients : Barbra Streisand 's face , a musical , feminism , Barbra Streisand 's voice , Barbra Streisand directing , and an ultra - corny / idiotic premise.<br /><br />Hollywood is full of egomaniacs , this much we know . In fact , nearly everyone  by definition  has to be an egomaniac in Hollywood . Why would anyone want to act ? For the " art " ? ! ? Well , if you 're dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews   And Streisand has the biggest ego of them all ! This is quite an achievement . To be surrounded by narcissistic cretins , and yet to manage to top them all  remarkable.<br /><br />The movie , like all her " solo " endeavors , is an ego trip straight out of hell . Every scene Streisand is in is automatically ruined . Stillborn . But as it that were n't enough , she sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs  you know , the kind that enabled the Mariah Careys , the Celine Dions , and the Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air - waves for decades now . Just for that she deserves not one but 100 South Park episodes mocking her.<br /><br />The premise , Streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi , sounds like a zany ZAZ comedy . Apart from it being a cliché , the obvious problem is that Streisand does n't look like a woman nor does she look like a man  in fact I 'm not even sure she 's human . The way she looks in this movie , well   it can not be described in words . E.T. looks like a high - school jock by comparison . She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015 . She looks HORRIBLE.<br /><br />The songs . They made me shiver . Particularly " Papa Can You Hear Me Squeel Like A Demented Female Walrus In Heat ? " and " Tomorrow Night I 'll Prepare the Sequel , YENTL 2 : THE RETURN OF THE BITCH".<br /><br />Did you know that Streisand considered having a nose - job early on in her career , but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change ? Can you believe that ? She should have done it ! Killing two flies with one swipe , that 's what it would have been.<br /><br />If you 're interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals , contact me by e - mail.<br /><br />SHOULD BARBRA STREISAND FINALLY GO INTO RETIREMENT ?

0 With the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget , ( truly ) independent horror film . Make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective , the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor.<br /><br />The major problem with Frightworld is it 's length , at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie , plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant.<br /><br />In places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour . However when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch.<br /><br />This could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal " serial killer back from the dead " movie with some judicious and ruthless editing , in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut .
0 This movie is actually worse than most movies I 've ever suffered through , and I 've suffered through a lot . Absolute nonsense . It 's got terrible , forced dialogue ; pointless plot developments ; really drawn out ' spooky imagery ' scenes , which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie ; 5/10 at best attractive women ; long , boring sex scenes involving said women ( forget what you know about virgins ! especially ones with lop- sided fake breasts ) ; muttered , difficult to understand speech from some of the characters ; and they actually used the masks from Killer Klowns from Outer Space during a masturbation scene , which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny , but it is n't . Veden Fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film . < br /><br />Absolutely give this one a miss .
0 This was a weird movie . It started out pretty good . A solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />Next comes his " down fall " Here i could tell I was in for a real cheesy " B " movie . Poor acting , I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop ? These guys could not . After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts ... <br /><br />From this point on it is bad acting big boobs , the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes.<br /><br />That said I gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that I just could not quite shake off.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie but I have to admit I have seem worse .
0 Very bad . Very , very bad . As a fellow who aspires to make , be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set , I find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made . However , this movie ... oh dear.<br /><br />Realizing Frightworld does n't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation ( an honorable thing in itself ) and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake . And to be fair , it is more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not by much . So I wo n't try to critique , just let me ask throw out some observations.<br /><br />1 ) If gore is the point of the movie , should n't you be able to see it?<br /><br />2 ) If you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment.<br /><br />3 ) In a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll . Difficult I know but really ... <br /><br />4 ) There is a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area , most you can hire really cheap . Get one who knows how to frame a scene.<br /><br />5 ) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does n't mean he should do so every two seconds.<br /><br />6 ) Kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time , get girls who 's tops we want to see taken off.<br /><br />7 ) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood . At the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags . A chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary , it 's sloppy.<br /><br />Some good things . Not all the acting was bad . Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once she started fighting back . There was some neat imagery , unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason . " Acid Poptart " is a name that deserves a better movie . I like the moxie of Frightworld too . Next time , now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts , I hope all involve aspire to something better than Colman Francis . Upgrade at least Ed Wood .
0 As low budget indies go , you will usually find that you get what you pay for , and let me just say , I did n't pay much for " Frightworld" ... <br /><br />Writer / Director : David R. Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park , besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer . Not a bad premise , but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes . The camera work tries to be too cleaver for it 's audience , by constantly using shaky quick - cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us . This becomes evident right off the bat , as we are introduced to the would - be killer , and soon realize that the ( acting ) is the scariest thing happening ... After a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times , yet the acting remains the same . " Frightworld " does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun - house , but with an extremely long running time , it ca n't save the film from it 's below average indie hell.<br /><br />There is some mediocre nudity , but not much for gore , which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies.<br /><br />Fans of really bad B - Movies might find something of interest here , otherwise , do n't spend a lot of cash .
0 Do n't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot . I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re : Death On The Nile . Everyone has done this one ! We know who dies . We know why they die . We know who the killer is . We know how it was done . So I say enough already ! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christie 's novels . I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . The sets were terrific and very realistic . I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how ' awful ' he looked . I hope he does n't look that way in ' real ' life ! I honestly ca n't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . Somehow I do n't think so . I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way . I would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison !
0 In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience . Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie . Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer . The plot is thin to say the least , the Cantonese dialog is not funny . See this movie at your peril.<br /><br />David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate . The banal plot attempts to compete with other rom - coms out there , and just blends into the scenery . It was like watching paint dry . < br /><br />In short this movie was a total waste of time and space . I 've seen better movies on youtube .
0 Well what I can say about this movie is that it 's great to see so many Asian faces . What I did n't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role . The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead , the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the " keeping it real " black cab driver . Plus all the coke , shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious . The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel . Then again when watching romantic comedies you ca n't expect much but then again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once . The parents are the best part of the flick .
0 Like ' First Blood ' , this attempts to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam vets , but there really is n't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire , burnings , stabbings , torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible Rambo takes out half of Asia , a ton of Vietnamese soldiers , most of the Russian army , various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at . The only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off , allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises . Helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is Jerry Goldsmith , who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from Russian rat - a - tat to Chinese ching - chang - chong just in case we do n't quite understand who we 're looking at . Stallone has a brain in his head ; this empty nonsense is beneath him .
0 An offensively over - the - top action adventure , FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to catch the mood of the US at the time of it 's release in the mid-80's , with right - wing Reaganism and virulent anti - red feelings still not finished yet , though the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of the ' Evil Empire ' in Moscow would soon render these types of films redundant;even Reagan himself eventually admitted this truism.<br /><br />In that sense , we can be most grateful to ' Gorby',not for his disarmament treaties with the US , nor his policies of ' glasnost',or even his support of democracy being restored to the Eastern European countries in the former Soviet Union 's backyard . No , it 's the final diminution of foolish , jingoistic , bloated cold - war adventures like this . The first RAMBO film was hardly perfect , though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline . In this sequel , any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly , senseless plotting and incident in which Rambo single - handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped Vietnamese and Russian troops to rescue American POW 's ten years after the conflict ended , with the Americans on the losing side.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box - office success was to let many Americans wallow in fantasy;they may have lost the war , but there was still unfinished business at hand , and ludicrous comic - strip heroics with a robot - like hero killing virtually every red on sight , with as much hardware as possible , fulfilled such whimsically far - fetched ideals.<br /><br />This could have been entertaining on a SUPERMAN / SPIDERMAN level , but sadly everything is played absolutely straight . But that is not to say that there is no humour in the film;sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind . The action scenes , though technically adequate , never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness , because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts;namely , our hero Rambo is always unscathed ( aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there ) despite the tons of explosives , grenades , gunshots , etc.going around him.<br /><br />In between the mayhem , what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichés and banalities . Stallone , who co - wrote the script with James Cameron ( a long way from the exciting TERMINATOR made the previous year),deliberately seems to have given the Rambo character as little to say in understandable English , and merely comes out with moronic grunts , almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself . Maybe his colleague Cameron was thinking of The Terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character ! In this sense Rambo seems even less of a human than the Terminator did ! The rest of the cast do little better with good actors like Charles Napier and Richard Crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given , and Steven Berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his Russian KGB / Red Army villain roles . Berkoff 's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing . How come that Sly managed to survive Berkoff 's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those Red Commie scumbags ? Well , credibility is never this film 's strong point . It is a work of fantasy comparable with THE WIZARD OF OZ.At least that WAS meant to be a fantasy , and an immortal classic it turned out to be . This is only a classic of the most dismal , and indeed offensive , kind . And as for Sly 's climactic speech ... ,rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people , eh ? By the way , in the same year , he also made ROCKY IV .......... <br /><br />RATING:3 out of 10 .
0 George P. Cosmatos ' " Rambo : First Blood Part II " is pure wish - fulfillment . The United States clearly did n't win the war in Vietnam . They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh - so innocent soldiers . The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation , who made this war happen . The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this . He is extremely patriotic , bemoans that US - Americans did n't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier , but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians . Like every film that defends the war ( e.g. " We Were Soldiers " ) also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia . And for that matter also the reason for every single US - American soldier that was there . Instead , Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation . It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories , rather than suppressing them . " Do we get to win this time ? " Yes , you do .
0 This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made . This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself . " First Blood Pt . 2 " is very similar to Schwarzenegger 's " Commando " , but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys . This movie is a typical American anti - Soviet propaganda . True , this was the peak of the Cold War , but I 'm sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy . There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common . Why ca n't there a movie that show Americans as the enemy ? Who 's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army ? Do you really think that something like this would have really happened ? By the looks of it , an average , brain washed American viewer certainly would .
0 Years ago , when I was a poor teenager , my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay . And , while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to , I could n't resist a free trip to the movies ! That 's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN ! Now , despite this being a wretched movie , it is in places entertaining to watch -- in a brain dead sort of way . And , technically the stunts and camera - work are good , so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2 ! So why is the movie so bad ? Well , unlike the first Rambo movie , this one has virtually no plot , Rambo himself only says about 3 words ( other than grunts and yells ) , there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped " romance " and the movie is one giant ( and stupid ) special effect . And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects . While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo , none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark ! And , while the bad guys are using AK-47s , helicopters and rockets , in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear - powered tips ! ! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers ! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF starring Weird Al . Plus , HOT SHOTS , PART DEUX also does a funny parody of the genre -- not just this stupid scene.<br /><br />All - in - all , a movie so dumb and pointless , it 's almost like self - parody !
0 As an Army veteran , I was deeply offended by this film . In my opinion , it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war . To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement . If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon ( it was ) , it would have been better received . But it was taken seriously my many people , especially overseas . Silly as it sounds , wherever I went in Europe in the late 80 's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film . Unrealistic ? Hmm , let 's see . A monosyllabic , muscle - bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW 's . In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats . And he never misses , running with a 32 lb gun held up with one arm . I could go on , but I 'm getting a headache . I gave this a 2/10 only because it 's slightly better than Rambo III .
0 I remember I loved this movie when it came out . I was 12 years old , had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it . I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap . I put it in my VCR and started up : Man this movie is really bad ! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie ( except for that awful sentimental speech at the end ) , and has the same expression on his face all the way . And that stupid love thing in the middle , it 's just so amazingly predictable . I just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else .
0 I do n't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail . Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo , author and survivor of " A Season in Hell " , recruited from prison by his only friend , Major Richard Crenna , to secretly return to Vietnam , take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps , and return without engaging the enemy.<br /><br />Fat chance . What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in , take pics , and sneak out ? Who would come to see the movie ? < br /><br />It 's essentially a celebration of Stallone 's muscles . Preparing for his mission , we see his well - oiled muscles bulging . ( They are oiled and bulging throughout . ) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather , ugly guns , and even uglier knives . The black guns are cleaned , assembled with loud clacks , and almost as oiled as Stallone 's muscles . The bow is tested and , yes , it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy 's forehead . The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.<br /><br />Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington , cynical politicians who , you can bet , were never even in a fist fight in grammar school . No guts , you know ? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.<br /><br />The movie does what it set out to do , but what it set out to do is meretricious . It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese . The bumper stickers were ubiquitous . ( Free Our MIAs . ) Why would they keep them ? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor . Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States -- a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.<br /><br />As a captive , Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese . Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists , his muscles still on display . Then , not content with subhuman Vietnamese , a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer -- " Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember . " A high - tech type , the Russian uses psychology and electricity , not just pig dump.<br /><br />Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until " this country loves us as much as we love it , " bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed , which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high - echelon positions . The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group . At least Rambo 's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel , which arrived apace.<br /><br />The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless . It marches dully through it 's phantasmal ideological swamp , killing without mercy , barely speaking , barely able to speak . To speak is a sign of weakness .
0 While the original First Blood had its far - fetched moments , it was at least exciting in parts . In Rambo : First Blood , Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic - book action . Plausibility is totally rejected ; logic nose - dives ; Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission . Just like any other wish - fulfilment actioner of that time ( e.g. Invasion USA , Commando , Red Scorpion ) , Rambo : First Blood , Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for . If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers , what is left to get excited about?<br /><br />Imprisoned after the events of the first movie , John J Rambo ( Sylvester Stallone ) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East . The year is 1985 , and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam . Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman ( Richard Crenna ) , but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock ( Charles Napier ) . Rambo 's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs  if it does n't , he is to rendezvous with a chopper ; if it does , he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date . Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge , the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao ( Julia Nickson ) . Sure enough , Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp , but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them   when he reaches the rendezvous point , the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who , it seems , does n't really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications . Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured , but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock.<br /><br />The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff 's polished photography , Jerry Goldsmith 's exhilarating score , and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics . Beyond these scant pickings , the film is a failure . The actors are reduced to macho posturing , the plot rings false , the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless , the dialogue is absurd   even the violence becomes numbingly predictable . At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan , a man with simplistic and near - hysterical anti - communist sentiments . For this reason , contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie - bashing shooting - fest as if it was the greatest movie of all - time , transforming it into an undeserved box office success . Thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple - minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count , ludicrously dumb politics , and a ludicrous hero .
0 The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now . If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam , or the manner in which those who returned were treated , then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost . Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves , and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world , as the saying goes . First Blood Part II , on the other hand , is little more than a fist - pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be , both in victory and defeat . Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando , while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient . Where it all comes undone is in the script , which did n't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris . What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone , as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo 's massive chest.<br /><br />The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood . The film , that is - the novel did n't allow for the possibility of sequels . In this mediocre follow - up , Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open - air mine . As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat , a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman , who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission . Rambo , never one to back down from a hard day 's violent work , accepts , and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand ( I forget which ) . From there , he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held , and photograph them . His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release . Rambo being Rambo , however , has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications.<br /><br />Of course , things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo 's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found . It is the age - old conspiracy theory , and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for . Of course , with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s , they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians . Together , the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo , but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets , arrows , rockets , and destruction . About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail - like chalice and declares himself invincible.<br /><br />To be honest , First Blood Part II is a well - photographed , and well - choreographed , action spectacle . The hand - to - hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever . The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to . Fortunately , this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds . Some of the kills shown here are quite creative , despite all the problems . The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy . The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous . Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter . Sure , there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact , but never this ridiculous before.<br /><br />I gave Rambo : First Blood Part II a one out of ten . It is so bad it is ridiculous , and so ridiculous that it is often funny . One does n't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are . The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved . Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek , and it might be watchable .
0 I think it 's time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him . This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer . Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies . Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was . This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam , that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets . In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch . What is worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end ... Please ! ! Oh yeah I heard they are making another one ...
0 By rights , there should never have been a " First Blood Part II " . The original script for " First Blood " had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film , but this was changed to allow him to live , not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing . Nevertheless , someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste , because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties , plus the recently released fourth instalment.<br /><br />The official title of this film was " Rambo : First Blood Part II " , but it is more commonly known simply as " Rambo " . It starts with the title character in jail , where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in " First Blood " , although this is never made too explicit . He is removed from prison by his former commanding officer , Colonel Trautman , for a secret mission . Rambo is to return to Vietnam to investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime . He is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy ; his is to be simply a fact - finding mission.<br /><br />What Rambo does not realise is that he is being set up , not by Trautman , who is portrayed as brave , honourable and incorruptible , but by the organiser of the mission , a military bureaucrat named Murdock . Murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam , partly because that will improve relationships between the American and Vietnamese governments , partly because it will make his own life easier . Unfortunately for Murdock , Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner , they are also being kept in hellish conditions . Of course , he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate , and tries to rescue them . The rest of the film is more or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies ( including a beautiful Vietnamese girl ) and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies . Most of the evil commies , of course , end up dead , although I was surprised to learn from your " trivia " section that the total death toll was as low as 67 . At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army.<br /><br />The tone of this film is very different from the first . In " First Blood " Rambo was unquestionably a criminal , even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability . In " Rambo " he is a bona fide all - American hero . A few years earlier the director , George Pan Cosmatos , had made " The Cassandra Crossing " , a biased piece of left - wing anti - American propaganda . Cosmatos , however , was nothing if not versatile , and " Rambo " proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right - wing pro - American propaganda . The one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad.<br /><br />"First Blood " had its faults , but it also had its virtues . Its stance , that the anti - war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life , was a controversial one , but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war , social attitudes to war , and the roots of violence in society . " Rambo " , by contrast , has very few virtues , except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing . It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans who were still sore about the Vietnam war . Rambo re - fights the war single - handed , and this time the right side wins . Take that , Charlie Cong ! < br /><br />By this point , no doubt , the film 's admirers ( and there seem to be plenty- more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars ) will have concluded that I am a liberal commie - loving pinko . Far from it- in fact , I have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology . What I dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems , including ideological disputes , is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible . It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of South - East Asia or why not everyone in the region was pro - American . For all its anti - Communism , the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out themselves- except that they attributed all the world 's problems to Capitalism , or Imperialism , or Revisionism , or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to . Compared to " Rambo " , " The Green Berets " was a masterly piece of political analysis . 3/10
0 The summary pretty much sums it all up . This is nowhere near as good as the original . With a script co - written by both Stallone and James Cameron ( at the same time he was also writing Aliens ) . Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone.<br /><br />Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids , depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.<br /><br />Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon . He eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex - forces to placate Rambo.<br /><br />The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam . Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself . He is told it 's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.<br /><br />After a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit , meets his contact ( who turns out to be a cute woman ) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.<br /><br />He finds there are still prisoners and rescues one . As the 3 flee from half the Vietnamese Army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick - up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board.<br /><br />Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter . It is clear as Trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.<br /><br />Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz . Killing many of them , Rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base.<br /><br />He resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him but destroys the Ops Centre.<br /><br />A weak plot and very weak ending as Rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man .
0 Usually , any film with Sylvester Stallone is usually going to suck ass . Rambo : First Blood Part II was no exception to this . The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in that were good were Rocky and First Blood . This film is extreamly unrealistic , and boring . It has action , but not very good action . I did n't enjoy watching it , and I would never ever watch this again . No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture . I would give this a 3/10 , the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action , but not good enough .
0 -me and my sister have right now watch that movie . we have laugh to the deaf . can u imagine on covers there is nomination for Oscar ? ? --first , musician have mix about 4 - 5 different style of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves ... <br /><br />---main character Silvester do not fit in there . he look like Mexican Tarzan.<br /><br />----Russian soldiers are everything but not Russian faces :-) -----ok , the main points : 1 . airplane called charter painted in black ... <br /><br />2 . what is an idea when Rambo go to jump from the airplane , but he stuck ? rope mix 3 . a Girl ? the best scene is when she dies .

0 Growing up with the Beast Wars transformers , I was n't very familiar with the original Transformers , and now that I have seen the awesome movie , and now that I have seen the older cartoon on which it 's based , I have to say I like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than Beast Wars.<br /><br />Not that I do n't like the BW characters , I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal.<br /><br />I mean , " AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT ! " sounds a lot better than " MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE ! " The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me a strong believer that he 's a real commander , more so than Optimus Primal.<br /><br />Besides , Powermaster Optimus Prime is a lot more powerful than Optimal Optimus . Just look on the web ! < br /><br />Megatron in the BW character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series.<br /><br />Besides what 's cooler , robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships ? Gimme the original Transformers any day over Beast Wars !
0 Beast Wars is a show that is over - hyped , overpraised and overrated . Let 's meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this.<br /><br />Cheetor- Seriously , they need to have censor bars on this guy . How come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby Taz ? ( at least Razzoff from Rayman 3 : Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide ) Action Blast- If you want a line of show that suck , get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron- A show that should go down in a toilet . Good Job Creators ( Sarcasm ) Show it self - Retarded & boring ( at least the Super Mario games are better ) This show had a lot of followers sayin ' bring it back , but I believe that it was cancelled for its own good .
0 The actors did a really good job playing their roles -- particularly the mom . However , as the movie progressed I found I was watching it more for their acting and not because I cared in the least for the people . And , at times , I felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands - off approach to parenting displayed again and again . The daughter is a 17 year - old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette ( complete with lots of " booty shaking " ) . The son is a guy with low self - esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends -- so much that he throws a drug party late in the film . The husband and wife are both bored , but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners ( though the wife picks poorly , as the man she " throws herself at " happens to be gay --- OOPS ! ) . I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks . I think the author 's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system . However , given that these characters are NOT typical of the average western family , it seems disingenuous .
0 The plot it 's not so original . If someone saw " L'ultimo Bacio " there 's nothing new . A wealthy family in Rome living everyday life that 's is boring and false , with everyone asking to others what they think about them . Really boring after an half of hour because it 's simple to understand where the story is going to finish . This because it 's simple to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie , so even the hardest parts seem normal . To summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said . the family saw from a 30 years old , i do n't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations . Really good how Muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it 's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining . Perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it . Morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie !
0 The film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are , and who the characters are . And that is the moment i started to dislike the movie . With all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand , i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything . I actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept.<br /><br />I hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are , which date we are at , and especially what the characters feel and think . I believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience . < br /><br />But after the bad influencing intro , a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time . The lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way . I think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations . For example , a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first , but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well . I think the director is a very good observer about real life.<br /><br />But that is it . After a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story - telling . I really felt like I 'm having a big headache because of the non - stop talking characters . It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs . It is realistic really , but characters always asking " really , is that so " etc . to each other , or characters saying " no " or " are you listening to me , " ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache.<br /><br />I also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be . I understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot , but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes .
0 " Look , I know this may suck right now , but pain is temporary , film is forever . Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come . "  Robert De Niro < br /><br />This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg , the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes . And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro . Like " Jurassic Park " , " Poltergeist " and " War of the Worlds " , the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast , the beast being the creation of the father , a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial . < br /><br />In typical Spielberg fashion , the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins . Like Oscar Schindler , Robin Williams , Sam Niel , Tom Cruise and virtually every " daddy " figure in Spielberg land , the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys.<br /><br />But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese , who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare . The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese 's filmography , and , ironically , his most illuminating.<br /><br />An artist 's failures or misfires are often very revealing , exposing the inner workings of their art . When the story does n't work , the characters do n't connect or the images do n't sear , we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core . This  the remaining carcass- is what the director 's cinema is about.<br /><br />Now " Cape Fear " is an impersonal film , so we wo n't find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese 's filmography ( " You already sacrificed me ! " De Niro yells , but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter ) . What the film does , though , is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on . Watch how Scorsese 's camera desperately whips back and forth , how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention . But more importantly , watch how the film makes no spatial sense . A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound - stage , a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family 's house does n't seem to exist anywhere in particular . There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture , Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment . < br /><br />The reason for this is that Scorsese 's camera always has to be bound , or intimately tethered , to his central character . For the world around the character to make sense , his camera has to be focused on the character . Resnais can take you around a French Hotel , Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building , Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic , Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape , Lucas can give you an alien desert planet , and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook " close up - mid shot - wide shot " combinations , but Scorsese ca n't do this . There 's no poetry , no sense of tangible space in his films . He 's all about the character . You break that tether , you leave that boxing ring , that taxi cab , you look away from De Niro , and everything collapses . He simply can not break away from this very documentarian style of shooting , which , in a way , is a prerequisite for action film - making.<br /><br />Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with " Gangs of New York " , where the space and the sets become the central character , but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis , the actor drawing Scorsese 's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.<br /><br />5/10  Even as a generic B - movie , this is an ugly , vulgar looking film . Look at the matte paintings , the inept attempts at tension , the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown . Still , we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack . De Niro , who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ , gives the film its only great scene . In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis , he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her . A kind of symbolic rape , the girl runs away , both aroused and repelled by this man 's interest.<br /><br />But De Niro 's performance , so deliciously over the top , simply ca n't be imitated by Scorsese . You 'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work . But Scorsese ? Nope.<br /><br />Worth one viewing .
0 I think we all begin a lot of reviews with , " This could 've made a GREAT movie . " A demented ex - con freshly sprung , a tidy suburban family his target . Revenge , retribution , manipulation . Marty 's usual laying on of the Karo syrup . But unfortunately somewhere in Universal 's high - rise a memorandum came down : everyone ham it up.<br /><br />Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised , Lange bitches her way through cigarettes , Lewis " Ohmagod 's ! " her way though her scenes , and Bobby D ... well , he 's on a whole other magic carpet . Affecting some sort of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid , he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as " Problem Child " . And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above . Now imagine it spouting brain - clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles , and you have De Niro 's schtick here . Most distracting of all , though , is his most OVERDONE use of the " De Niro face " he 's so lampooned for . Eyes squinting , forehead crinkled , lips curled . Crimany , Bob , you looked like Plastic Man.<br /><br />The story apparently began off - screen 14 years earlier , when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults . Upon release , he feels Nolte 's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin . And we 're supposed to give De Niro 's character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might 've shortened his sentence . De Niro being one of these criminals who , despite being guilty of unspeakable acts , feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside . Mmm - kay.<br /><br />He goes after Notle 's near - mistress ( in a scene some may want to turn away from ) , his wife , his daughter , the family dog , ya know . Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick 's screenplay : utter predictability . As each of De Niro 's harassments becomes more gruesome , you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens . Strick is n't to be totally discredited , as he manages a few compelling dialogue - driven moments ( De Niro and Lewis ' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film 's best scene ) , but mostly it 's all over - cranked . Scorsese 's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced , not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re - worked Bernard Hermann score ( I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula).<br /><br />Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick . Unintentionally comedic , that is . You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening , but you ca n't help but snicker out of sight of others ? You 'll do it here . Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity , De Niro 's thumb - flirting , he cross - dressing , and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed . And Bob 's infernal , incessant , CONSTANT , mind - damaging , no - end - in sight blowhard ramblings of all the " philosophy " he disovered in prison . I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.<br /><br />I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers , but here it 's necessary . This really * is * Scorsese 's version of Freddy Krueger . The manner in which De Niro relishes , speaks , stalks , withstands pain , right down to his one - liners , is vintage Freddy . Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water : " You trying ' to offer sumpin ' hot ? " Please . And that 's just one example.<br /><br />Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam , Peck , and Mitchum nearly 30 years later ( or want a serious head - shaking film experience ) , avoid a trip to the Cape .
0 I really do n't want to compare Martin Scorsese 's Cape Fear to the classic 1962 Cape Fear film , but I ca n't help it . Not only am I a huge fan of the Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck starred Cape Fear , but when Scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film ( Cady taking the keys out of the ignition , dog dying ) and even using Bernard Herrmann 's score throughout the entire film , he 's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as I ca n't help but think of the classic Cape Fear nearly every scene . When comparing Scorsese 's version of Cape Fear to the classic version , the remake comes out destroyed by the classic ; but even when taking the film by itself , it 's still bad.<br /><br />Now Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick did n't just remake the 1962 Cape Fear scene for scene , they tried to do things differently . Unfortunately this is one of the film 's problems . Gone is the original crazy and animal - like Max Cady who is out for personal revenge , the Max Cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to " save " Sam Bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side ( his words , not mine ) . Also gone is the stand - up and strong Sam Bowden seen in the classic Cape Fear film , the Sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy , Magoo , distrustful , and very unlikable . Even Mrs. Bowden is a completely different character - she 's crazier than Max Cady is ! The overall story has also been changed around - Sam did n't testify against Cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version , Sam is now Cady 's ex - lawyer who Cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to " save " him.<br /><br />The overall story has been changed , and I do n't hold too much against it , but the overall script is also weak all around . Other sub - plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture , they are also just poorly written . The film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you ca n't take the least bit seriously . These aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have , but they have some help in this department as well.<br /><br />Now the classic version of Cape Fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety . However , Scorsese is unable to do any of this in his Cape Fear , giving the film a cookie - cutter early 1990s look , no sense of danger , no suspenseful scenes , and little style ( unless you count animating fire and the skyline style ) . Yeah , there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this Cape Fear bigger than the original , but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe.<br /><br />If all that was n't enough , the acting is n't great either . Robert De Niro ( being somehow nominated for an Academy Award for his performance ) starts off alright as Max Cady , but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film . The opposite thing happens for Jessica Lange and her performance of Mrs. Bowden , going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end . As Sam Bowden , Nick Nolte stays the same throughout the whole film : beige . Juliette Lewis ( who also reeled in an Academy Award nomination ) is decent enough in her role as Danielle Bowden , but she 's called upon to play a real stupid character and it 's hard to really like what we see on screen from her.<br /><br />This film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes , and I ca n't figure out why . I wanted to like it ; I really did - I mean , if there 's going to be a remake of Cape Fear I 'd rather like that one too - but I just could n't . Containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original Cape Fear , I found Martin Scorsese 's Cape Fear to be a very bad film indeed . The best things about the film are Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck in their supporting roles - go figure .
0 One of Scorsese 's worst . An average thriller ; the only thing to recommend it is De Niro playing the psycho . The finale is typically of this genre i.e. over - the - top , with yet another almost invincible , immune - to - pain villain . I did n't like the 60s original , and this version was n't much of an improvement on it . I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake . Then again , considering how bad his recent movies have been ( I 'm referring to his dull Buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress , the blond girl Di Caprio ) this is n't even that bad by comparison . And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... could have been far worse .
0 I 'm surprised this movie is rated so highly , although if I were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c- or d so perhaps that 's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic . Not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to , and yet the woman who got rapped did n't press charges because she did n't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she did n't even know . There were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill / beat Kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since Kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd . So now I 've just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please do n't see it so at least your life wo n't be waisted and that way my 2 1/2 hours or so has meant something .
0 While I ca n't deny that his movies are often entertaining , I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities . His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream " Look at me , are n't I an imaginative director ? " . His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes , the superlative " Raging Bull".<br /><br />For this remake it appears it was business as usual , though . The dull film stock to convey a 1950 's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself . The melodramatic close - ups combined with the sub - par imitation of the classic " Psycho " score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror . The score for " Psycho " was brilliantly unnerving , this ' homage ' just sounds shrill and annoying . Even the cast , who can be decent at times , deliver histrionic performances that just scream ' caricature ' ; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family.<br /><br />The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro . Sure , he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away . Now I 'm no expert on American accents , me originally coming from near Manchester in England an ' all , but surely he could 've come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that ? Being the gifted physical actor he is , he almost overcomes this fatal flaw , but not quite . It was disconcerting for me , as a De Niro fan , to be wishing he was off screen , rather than rapt at his performance.<br /><br />(POSSIBLE SPOILERS.)<br /><br />The over - the - top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale . When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment ? I also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the ' killer - not - dead - yet ' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.<br /><br />All in all , a thoroughly ridiculous ' thriller ' . Scorsese and De Niro have done MUCH better work together .
0 Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess . Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman . The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced . Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! De Niro 's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90 's movie psycho killer . The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies . One of my most horrible movie experiences . Rent the original it 's 100 times better . < br /><br / >
0 This remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.<br /><br />DeNiro is a superb actor , dedicated to giving his all in the work he does , however he needs direction to focus his talent , and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.<br /><br />Gregory Peck 's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst Robert Michum is always fun to watch , even with as few lines as this.<br /><br />Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo 's Oil but is not on the same form as " Weeds " . Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.<br /><br />Some good points ? The start credits ( ! ) , the first view of Cody 's back when doing dips in the prison , the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats , Sam Bowden 's decent into full - fledged panic , Cody 's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence.<br /><br />The worst ? The " Cleaning woman - BUT NOT REALLY ! ! ! " part . Clinging bare - handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed . ( Are there no speed bumps in the US ? ) The " He 's dead - BUT NOT REALLY ! ! ! " partS and the aforementioned rambling ending.<br /><br />I may watch the original again , but I 've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it .
0 What ever possessed Martin Scorcese to remake this film ? And not only did he remake it , completely ruin it ? The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro ( in his most overdone performance , and that 's saying a lot ) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous , and exemplary of attitudes harbored by Hollywood ( and Mr. Scorcese especially)- attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back . In any case , this movie is awful . < br /><br / >
0 Worst movie , ( with the best reviews given it ) I 've ever seen . Over the top dialog , acting , and direction . more slasher flick than thriller . With all the great reviews this movie got I 'm appalled that it turned out so silly . shame on you martin scorsese
0 Christ . A sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time , this at least has the decency to leave out the songs ( bar a reprise of the unbearable " Tomorrow " ) but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny . This time , Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins 's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite . The movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is : every time the little bugger squeals " Leapin ' lizards ! " I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder . Drearily photographed , slushy and plodding , the movie has only one memorable line ( " Unhand me , you stupid genius ! " ) and the fact that it 's not the original to recommend it .
0 Well where do i start ? i think it 's very insulting to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn . I love the film Annie , and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film , but i was so disappointed ! the acting is awful , the original Annie came out a few years before i was born , I 'm now 25 and Annie is still one of my favourite films , So i was really excited to see Annie 2 . The acting was awful in the film , were any of the characters original ? very badly written , directed and acted . This is not a film i wish to see again , and any Annie lover i recommend that you do n't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed . The young girls singing is n't bad but still does n't compare to the original
0 Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else I would 've chosen it . This movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance . Carol Burnett , Albert Finney , Tim Curry , Bernadette Peters , Edward Hermann , the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn , and expert directing from seasoned pro John Huston ( father of actress Angelica Huston)is what made this film so charming . Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates , Victor Garber , Alan Cumming , and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel . Before she did this movie all Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the prime time show Growing Pains . She had a few bit parts in movies but I do n't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own . And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom , ridiculous ! They could n't get good enough actors to play the major roles like Daddy Warbucks , Miss Hannigan , and Annie but they will sign Joan Collins to play some British lady ? It does n't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was . The critics were right to have not agreed with this movie , even if it was only made for TV , it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie .
0 This film is absolutely awful , but nevertheless , it can be hilarious at times , although this humor is entirely unintentional.<br /><br />The plot was beyond ridiculous . I do n't even think a 2 year - old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film - makers tried to slap together into a story . However , on the positive side , some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor . For example , " Wow , Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard ! " It gets worse ( and even funnier ) , but I 'll spare you.<br /><br />The acting is generally laughable . Most of the kids ' roles are sort of cute , but not very believable . On the other hand , Annie is pretty awful all - around . The adults do n't take their roles seriously at all , but this is largely a good thing . If they 'd tried to be believable , the film would 've been even worse . Which is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />Once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie , there are actually a few standout moments of almost - not - crappiness . The scene where Lady Hogbottom 's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious , though it 's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police . The butler character , while very minor , is a ray of sunlight that almost , but never quite pierces through the gloom.<br /><br />Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain . Nevertheless , there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally . Judged on its good parts alone , the movie would be about a 5 ; unfortunately , the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 . Thus , I give it a 3.<br /><br />That 's being pretty generous , I 'd say .
0 Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about ' Annie ' . The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production . It was very clearly made for TV , yet if I found it on my television , I would flick it straight over . The children in the film do an alright job , yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in . This film lacked the music / dance numbers that s made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love . Johnson , as Annie is at times annoying and over acted .. you can not convince yourself that she truly is Annie . The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film . Sad to say this sequel was a total flop .
0 Annie 's wig does not look good . she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie . Annie sticks out in the movie , as her outfits look like Halloween costumes . terrible acting and terrible plots . This movie is such a change from the 1982 version . I think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role . Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie . Not appealing at all . At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbucks . Ms. Hannigan was also miscast . Camilla Belle played Molly alright . " Warning " this movie might insult your IQ so you might just want to only show it to very young children . 8 and younger . Some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world .
0 Since the 70s , writer / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science - fiction , fantasy and horror B - movies . Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect ; many of them are pretty bad . Trancers ( 1985 ) was one of those rare gems.<br /><br />A Terminator style tale of time - travel and action , Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth , a future cop given the task of tracking down bad - guy Whistler , who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor . Whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers , converting them into obedient zombies ( the ' trancers ' of the title ) , and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future . Jack follows him to 1985 , determined to stop him.<br /><br />In this 1991 sequel , Jack is still living in 1985 . Having destroyed Whistler , he has settled down and married Leena ( Helen Hunt ) , the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie . But , for Jack , things do n't stay calm for long , and trouble appears in the form of Whistler 's brother , E.D. Wardo , who is trying to build a trancer army.<br /><br />Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was . The story is difficult to pick up if you have n't seen the first film ( or at least not for a long while ) , and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects . Gone is the inventiveness and wit that made Trancers so much fun ; instead we get some cheesy one - liners and a script that feels like it was written on - the - fly.<br /><br />About the only reason I can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast , which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci - fi and horror movies : Jeffrey Combs , Barbara Crampton , Richard Lynch , Martine Beswicke . Unfortunately , most of them seemed to be having an ' off day ' whilst filming Trancers II , and performances are mediocre at best.<br /><br />The Trancers series obviously has its fans ; four further sequels have since been churned out . Unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing , I ca n't imagine them being any good .
0 The original Trancers is not by any means a great movie . It had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic . However , it was entertaining , better done than most low - budget B - movies , and could be surprisingly witty . Unfortunately , Trancers II is none of these.<br /><br />Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels . The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid . It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough , and did n't bother with anything else . Not even veteran B - grade actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this film out of the muck.<br /><br />A brief plot overview : Jack Deth ( Thomerson ) is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government . Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers . Jack Deth is married to Lena ( Helen Hunt ) , the woman he met in the first movie , and both live with Hap Ashby , the man Deth was sent into the past to protect . It is discovered that the brother of Whistler ( the bad guy from the first movie ) has traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers , people turned into mindless killing zombies , to kill Ashby . Complicating Jack 's mission is the fact that his first wife , who had died long before Jack traveled to the past , was also sent back to stop Whistler 's brother , and now Jack finds himself working with her.<br /><br />I have two real problems with this movie . One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie . What makes it annoying is that , in a rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism , they act like it was always the technique.<br /><br />The other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth , Lena , and Alice Stilwell ( Jack 's first wife ) is given very little screen time . This bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie . It felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie . Alice 's character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he 's re - married , making her either very shallow or very poorly written.<br /><br />The only reason I can think of for watching this movie is if you 're interested in watching the entire Trancers series ( currently totaling six movies ) . Otherwise , even if you 're a fan of the original Trancers , stay away from this tepid sequel .
0 Why review good movies when you can review " Trancers II?" < br /><br />Ooh , this film is soooo lame . I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder , hurling extras in silly monster make - up at poor , long - suffering Tim Thomerson . The stars ' families actually turn up to play cameos , probably because Full Moon could n't afford " real " extras . Lame effects , lame sets , and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic Trancers!<br /><br />And yet ... and yet ... it rules . Note this is the same thing I say about " Trancers IV . " I say it because it 's true . What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies , then bust out with quips like , " Do n't worry ladies , they 're bio - degradable " ? Well , lots of things could be better , but anyway this is still good stuff.<br /><br />My only significant reservation is Megan Ward , who really stinks up the joint . She 's a lousy rival for Helen Hunt 's character - they 're both young pieces of eye candy , and it would 've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more . Oh well , you ca n't have everything . At least the wonderful plot device of the " long second watch " is back in place , and we 've got more of Hap Ashby , the least - convincing athlete in the history of cinema ( oh , wait a minute - he 's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in " Creator").<br /><br />I have n't seen this lately , but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle . Hooray for lousy continuity ! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film .
0 This is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original . This sequel is n't nearly as fun as part one , and it instead spends too much time on plot development . Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series , but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry . The performances are all adequate , but this time the script lets us down . The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting , so I need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a " Trancers " movie . Unfortunately , the laughs are few and far between , and so , this film is watchable at best .
0 Me and my friend rented this movie for $ 2.50 . And we both agree on one thing:<br /><br />THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!<br /><br />Also me and my friend counted 475 face shots . ( Which makes up 95 % of the movie).<br /><br />So in other words : DO SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY ! And I do!<br /><br / >
0 After the debacle of the first Sleepaway Camp , who thought that a franchise could be born . SC II is superior in aspect . More inspired killings and just whole lot more fun . While that might not be saying much ( compared to the first movie ) , Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rental.<br /><br />Pros : Entertaining , does n't take itself too seriously like SC I. Inspired Killings . Cons : Crappy acting and mullets abound.<br /><br />Bottom Line : 5/10<br /><br / >
0 Being a slasher film aficionado , I typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas , which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain , I will say . While channel surfing the other night , Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me . Of course , I wanted to check it out , as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise , but have never actually seen any of them ( for shame , I know ) . I will note that since I have not seen the original , my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously , because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise 's own design.<br /><br />Now I 'm assuming that the franchise of Sleepaway Camp is , in itself , a joke on itself . Hell , even the name comes off as an intentional joke . Sleep away camp ? It 's good fun . I can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value , but that 's about as far as I can go . The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth . Campy requires bad acting , but come on . Pamela Springsteen as the evil out - of - touch - with - reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast . As far as comedy goes , there were a few times where I chuckled , but it was few and far between.<br /><br />Ultimately , SAC II is pretty boring , and I really did want to sleep away the camp . The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them . If you 're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp , I recommend Club Dread . If your channel surfing takes you across this one , check and see what else is on .
0 No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full - time photographer ; it 's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one . While this movie is not without its interesting elements ( mullets from hell , etc . ) , it is outweighed by flaws . For one thing , Angela , the murderous counselor , appears to be about the same age as the campers . Having an older , more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film . And then you have the murder scenes . The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly ( no pun intended ) , although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original . But overall , there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier / more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching .
0 This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage , that no doubt wants to be a Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) clone . The poster for this movie makes it look like there 's going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy , which is likely to attract movie - goers . There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie . It just makes me sad , just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers ( 1988 ) on video or DVD , and waste their time with this sad , cynical , depressing movie.<br /><br />Angela Baker ( Pamela Springsteen ) is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills , who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is , and that they stay out of trouble . Meanwhile , the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one , with Angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home . Could Angela be the killer , who was once a man , who underwent a sex change operation years earlier ? Who knows ? Who cares?<br /><br />The 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genres , in which a mad killer goes berserk . Some have a plot , some do n't , but they 're all about as bad as this one . Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed , strangled , impaled , chopped up , burned alive , and mutilated . That 's all this movie is . It is just mindless , bloody violence.<br /><br />Watching this movie , I was reminded of the Friday the 13th movies , in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death . The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves . Imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers : " The world is a totally evil place , " this movie tells you , " and it 'll kill you . It does n't matter what your dreams or your hopes are . It does n't matter if you have a new boyfriend , or a new girlfriend . It does n't matter what you think , what you do or what your plans for the future are . You can forget those plans , because you 're just going to wind up dead . " < br /><br />And the sickest thing is -- and by not giving too much away -- the movie simply sets up room for a sequel . Well , why not ? They 've probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies . I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp ( 1983 ) , and , after watching its first sequel , I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels , as well as the original . And for parents , if you know kids who actually LIKE this movie , do not let them date your children .
0 This movie was bad from the start . The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high body count . The acting was horrible . The killings were acted out very badly . Like when Ally got stuffed down that toilet I guess it was in the abandoned cabin . But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see Ally so Angela must have gone in to get her . The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and chocked her . One it was horrible acting and two why would n't you just turn around and punch the bitch ? ! ? ! ? Then when Molly is getting chased by Angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her ? ? ? So stupid . This movie sucked ...
0 Despite being a sequel to the more potent original , this is more of a comical remake of Friday THE 13TH concerning the further antics of psychopathic Angela , killing more nubile teens for their " immorality " at a camp.<br /><br />Pamela Springsteen ( sister of Bruce ) looks great . There are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls , but the movie 's so ( unintentionally ) comedic rather than suspenseful , it 's a stinker.<br /><br / > * out of * * * * .<br /><br />MPAA : Rated R for graphic violence and gore , nudity , and for some sexuality , language , and drug use .
0 Angela Johnson ( Pamela Springsteen -- yes she 's related to Bruce ) , the killer from the first film , is up to her old tricks again . She 's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills . As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex , drugs and swearing things are fine . But a few step over the line and Angela kills them -- cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original " Sleepaway Camp " was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it . This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it . The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula . There are plenty of gory killings in here ( people are burnt alive , heads are cut off , throats slashed ) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical . This also has the smallest amount of campers I 've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles ( especially Higgins ) . As expected there 's the gratuitous female nudity ( here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman ) and the obligatory good girl / good boy team ( Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins ) . With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy -- even by slasher movie standards . There 's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse ! Boring and sick with a stupid plot , pointless nudity and bad gore . Skip it .
0 So Angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter , rather than the son that she was born , and now holds a job as - wait for it - a camp counselor ! How appropriate , right ? I know , I love it . Anyway , the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels - more blood , more imaginative killings ( which are n't imaginative , but still more so than the original ) , more nudity , a more elaborate plot , and generally worse than the original . < br /><br />It is entertaining in the same way as the original was , in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80 's that you ca n't help getting a good laugh . At one point , a guy asks Angela out , and she says " I 'll call you , " and then quickly walks away . The guy says to himself , " How is she gon na call me ? I do n't have a phone ! " and then he sniffs his armpits , wondering what turned her off ( it 's the hair , dude!!).<br /><br />It is a well - known fact that in 80s slasher movies , the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior , usually for being too promiscuous . When I first started getting into horror movies and saw the Friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s , I did n't realize this . I learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness . I was pretty impressed , not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message , albeit a morbid one , but that there was actually some thought put into it.<br /><br />But not in this movie ! At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims , she says " Let this be a lesson to you . Say no to drugs ! " Real subtle screen writing there , guys . Then again , the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie . Angela ( who , by the way , went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well - developed person and then changed her name from Angela to , umm , Angela ) , says at one point , " I do n't like being the wicked witch of the west , but I know what happens when things get out of control . " ( People start getting killed ... by me ! HA!)<br /><br />Then later , she demands that one of the counselors , Mare , make an apology , to which the girl replies , " I 'd rather die ! " Sorry , Mare , but you really walked into that one ... <br /><br />Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie ( except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules , which the one in the movie does n't ) . This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like . < br /><br />That 's okay though , you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around , although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie . I had n't seen that kind of thing much before . < br /><br />Definitely bad taste , even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie ....
0 this movie is not good.the first one almost sucked , but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching.this one has nothing.there's zero scare , zero tension or suspense.this is n't really a horror movie.most of the kills do n't show anything.there's no gore to speak of.this could almost be a TV , except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence.the acting is not very good , either.and do n't get me started on the dialogue.as for the surprise ending , surprise , there is n't one.i suppose it could have been worse , although i do n't see how.but then again , it is less than 80 minutes long , so i guess that 's a good thing.although it felt a lot longer . apparently this is the cut version of the film.i found it for a very cheap price , but it still not worth it.if you want the uncut more graphic version , check out the Anchor Bay edition.anyway,this version of Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1/10 from me . p.s.if you watch this movie , you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper.if you are a real fan , you might want to pick up Anchor Bay 's Sleepaway Camp(with survival kit ) three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features
0 Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality . It has Camp Councellor Angela(Pamela Anderson .. awful as the killer;her quips when she wastes people are n't even amusing)on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior . We run the gamut of boring , clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove , a kid who gets a chainsaw , one girl who gets drilled , one who gets shoved into the crapper(filled with leeches ) , one who is roasted , etc.<br /><br />It does n't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time . That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's(who plays the slut Ally)tits . Most of the violence occurs off - screen so even that will not satisfy .
0 This is not horror , as the first part was : This is ( " campy " ) light and humorous entertainment . Like in so many sequels , the action starts right away with no explanations . But there 's boobs , so I do n't complain . And real boobs that is . If I understand correctly , those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela " Bruce 's sister " Springsteen.<br /><br />This can not be thought without the first movie , so I compare this to it . Again there is too small clothing ( mainly pants ) and funny hair , it 's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in . Again there is really strange characters , this time even more visibly " pathological " ones . Especially the personnel of the camp . It 's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp . People are older : Most of the actors must be at least 25 , but I think they 're supposed to be 16 or something . Some " methods " used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant . Actually this movie do n't have much in common with the first part , and this is worse than it in every way .
0 " The Deadly Look of Love " is essentially " Fatal Attraction " with a couple of twists added onto the back half . The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three Movies of the Week . It is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation , and it adds nothing fresh to the genre.<br /><br />Brett ( Vincent Spano ) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund . Even though he has it all , he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with Janet ( Jordan Ladd ) . Janet , a doe - eyed blonde from Cedar Falls , falls hard for Brett , and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement . Shortly after the wedding , Mrs. Brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large , luxurious home she shared with her new husband . When the police question Brett , he promptly points the finger at Janet . Following her arrest , Janet seems to get loonier by the minute - not that she was the picture of stability before . Her defense attorney ( Holland Taylor ) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it.<br /><br />Did she do it or did n't she ? How will it end ? You can find out the answers to these questions the next time " The Deadly Look of Love " airs on your local station . And be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story : men are pigs , and women are crazy .
0 I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday , intending to tune - in to something else . Out of curiosity , I accessed the comments here , and found myself watching it to the end . I really did n't do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where you 're " fascinated , " and watch it for " another couple of minutes , " until you finally just watch to the end . And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view . The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano , and their earlier roles . But great is n't anywhere to be found anywhere here - story , performances , and particularly the absurd courtroom hi - jinks . We all know that Perry Mason ( before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb . mark ) , and Ben Matlock , are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom , instead of being boringly confined to a lectern . And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them , before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of , or shown , them . No real - life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.<br /><br />Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer . Actually Perry nearly always did this , but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit , pronounce it " reasonable doubt , " and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on - camera , sometimes presumed at the end of the show.<br /><br />But that said , Holland Taylor 's histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her , in the courtroom portion of this story , made the actions of Matlock / Mason more - closely resemble the slow , often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in real - life courtrooms.<br /><br />Every character in this presentation was either insipid , unsympathetic , obnoxious , boring , improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.<br /><br />The ending was the most banal , absurd , even silly conclusion possible - but again , fascinating because of this . Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals , and t.v . movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd - lead ( probably better if " 3rd- " ) roles , even in this venue . Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them . Give this one 1 star for the story / performances , and 3 additional for the fascination factor .
0 I do n't remember " Barnaby Jones " being no more than a very bland , standard detective show in which , as per any Quinn Martin show , Act I was the murder , Act II was the lead character figuring out the murder , Act III was the plot twist ( another character murdered ) , Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty ( Lee Meriwether ) asking her father - in - law Barnaby Jones ( Buddy Ebsen ) how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show.<br /><br />One thing I do remember was the late , great composer Jerry Goldsmith 's excellent theme song . Strangely , the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air . I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being badly miscast . I just wished the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered it.<br /><br />Update ( 1/11/2009 ) : I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of American Television channel . Let 's just say that I was more kind than Goldsmith about the show " Barnaby Jones . "
0 Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings , but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role . Leigh , playing bar - band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood , constantly leans on older sis Georgia , an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold . Perhaps due to her double duties as co - producer on the film , Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner : she is n't credible as a singer and , even if this is intentional , gives herself far too much screen - time at the microphone . Probably hoping for a tour - de - force , Leigh is wire - drawn and nervous and jagged ; however , we simply do not see any talent within this character ( Leigh is obviously a solid actress , but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her ) . If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal , we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the ( small ) breaks that she does . As it is , the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim . Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences , and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie 's bar performance with Georgia 's sold - out arena show -- both singing the same song -- and it 's a sadly nuanced moment ... but really , what 's the point ? * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I 'm not going to say that this movie is horrible , because I have seen worse , but it 's not even halfway decent . < br /><br />The plot is very confusing . I could n't really figure out what was happening and where things were going . When the movie was over , I was left scratching my head . I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up , but once the credits were over , that was it . I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie , with little or no transition between the two . < br /><br />Character development is very shallow . I could n't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone . I could n't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk , stoned , mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them . This film seems to be based around stereotypes ( to it 's credit , they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band ) , which SHOULD make character development easier , since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child , or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean . Stereotypes are easy to depict , which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters . This film , on the other hand , uses stereotypical characters left and right , but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible.<br /><br />Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation . I guess that 's OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really did n't get a chance to know any of them , so I never really missed any of them.<br /><br />And last but not least was Sadie 's singing . It 's awful . The music backing her up is not prize winner , but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from Sadie 's vocal cords . I swear that there 's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes . I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off during this howl - a - thon.<br /><br />As a whole , this movie is confusing . Characters are ill - developed , Georgia 's acting is wooden and stiff , Sadie 's character is yanked from one bad situation to another , with no back story or explanation . The music was unbearable , and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain .
0 A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside . This little girl Rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery , and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night . The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her . She is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and , imagine the suspense here , experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks . From there she walks to the nearest house and discovers Mrs. Whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about Rosalie and her family . The earnestness exuded by the Mrs. Whitfield character has to be seen to be believed . Well , the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well . They all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school . None of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on , pause to remember lines , and have all the conviction of a paper bag . The director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary . It takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends , but by that time I did n't care . The murders are not convincing either , and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend 's farm with the people and things on hand there . That all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we do n't learn one darn thing about why Rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are . Cheap does n't even begin to describe the budget here with . It basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods . Someone lent the director a couple old cars too . No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make - up . There are so many guffaws / ridiculous moments to list , but I will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved : 1)Watch the gardener 's body well after he has been " slain " . Len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life . 2)the dying scene at the end where the actress playing Rosalie is killed . She looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method . 3)How about the guy playing Roaslie 's father giving us a cranky poor man 's Andy Griffith . The scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot . The Child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70 's cheese if you will . This is n't a B film but more like a Z film with producer Harry Novak making some money on virtually nothing .
0 There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly is n't one of them ! It 's a shame The Child is n't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes . We have the idea of a vengeful child , which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme , which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie . The plot is basically this : young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother , so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge ( as you do ) . This is all well and good , except for the fact that it 's boring ! Nothing happens for most of the film , and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore ; it 's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it . The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish . There 's really not much I can say about the film overall as there is n't much to it . The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly do n't recommend it .
0 This movie was seriously awful . The acting was the worst ! It was worse than a student film . Super cheesy , and I think the worst actor was the old lady . At first I thought to myself , well it 's an old movie . Then I remembered that that is no excuse ! I 've seen older movies with way better acting and such.<br /><br />The music was terrible to . It was really choppy . The editing was poor ( most of the dialog was out of sync.)<br /><br />Overall , this movie does n't even deserve a 1 . I only watched it because I was so bored , and the movie hardly entertained me . It was just laughable . My dead grandmother 's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this .
0 And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing . The acting and sound is awful . This might qualify for a " so bad it 's good " point of merit,,,for some . However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap - it 's just soooo cheap , I think that 's my major complaint . The dialogue is often hilarious - attention to how many times " you startled me " is used . The " child " actress is seriously god awful - I pray her acting career ended here .. her line " DONUTS ! I HATE DONUTS " is worth repeated viewing however .
0 If you 're going to look after a child , make sure they do n't live anywhere near a graveyard . Especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her ' friends ' . But , our long haired heroine , oblivious to all the signs , shacks up with her family the Nortons , which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter . Even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast 's tendency to talk even when their lips are n't moving , and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths . But enough of that .. domestic animals are being sacrificed , old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra wo n't shut up during any scene , even the quiet ones . Oh , and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.<br /><br />In fact , it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather , smelt what they 'd signed up for and gone AWOL . Yes , I know it 's hard to get into movies these days , but this sort of starter point is not one on your CV you 'd want . If would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting . Featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill Laurel Barnett , and another almost equally as bad by the charisma - free child actress Rosalie Cole ( The next Dakota Fanning she ai n't ) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.<br /><br />This involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed , while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood , a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on . But back up a minute .. earlier on they were in the car , and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it . So do they stay where they are safe ? No of course not , they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere , so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she 's having a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />Finally , the film closes . It does n't end , it just goes to a grinding halt . The main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood , as if nothing horrible had happened . But , my dear viewer , something horrible has happened . You have just sat through one of the most lamebrained , boring horror films you 're ever likely to see , and lost 82 minutes of your life you 'll never get back . Just think .. years from now on your deathbed , what you 'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family . Sadly , it 's already too late for me . Do n't you make the same mistake :( 2/10
0 Alicianne ( Laurel Barnett ) becomes a live in babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon ( Rosalione Cole ) who has recently lost her mother . But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave ( conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house ) late at night ... where she also meets her " friends" ... <br /><br />This starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery ... then falls apart . The story is thin and there is TONS of padding to make the film 85 minutes long . The acting is terrible across the board ( with Cole easily being the worst ) . Badly directed with some of the WORST editing I 've ever seen in a motion picture . Scenes ( and sound ) are just cut off with no rhyme or reason . Also the film has terrible ( and obvious ) post - production sound.<br /><br />As for blood and violence -- forget it ! There 's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake . I 've NEVER seen such fake - looking blood -- looks like ketchup ! Boring , pointless -- a rightfully forgotten drive - in movie . You can skip this one .
0 The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course ! It 's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie . Watching the movie and then listening to the writer / director 's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them . Call me old - fashioned , but I think of movies as a means of communication , and communication is n't complete if the audience does n't know what the hell the director is talking about . The director 's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of " Hollywood conventions " . Among those conventions , alas , is consistency of character and clarity of concept . The director himself realizes that audiences often do n't understand points where he has purposely avoided a " Hollywood cliché " . However , he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason . They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly . It 's fine to avoid them , but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea , not simply eliminated . The film is built on an intriguing premise , rich with potential . Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII . Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them . Someone with less disdain for the " Hollywood convention " of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea . This film certainly is n't it ! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters , but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script . In particular , I 'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo , who plays the lively corpse . In a number of muppet films , he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet .
0 The shame of it ! There I was , comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn , bouyant in the hope of another splendid Muppet night of entertainment . What did I get ? Disappointed ! How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this ? The humour was dreadful , the songs were worse than Country and Western ( and that 's saying something ) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew . I think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting Treasure Island . A short tale , such as Christmas Carol , is perfect because you can weave the Muppet high jinks around it .... here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun . Where do the Muppets go next ? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz ?
0 I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off , when watching it i got the chills , I even wet myself a little . When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time . Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being . Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past . This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox . He can raise my kid I 'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life .
0 ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE ( 1940 ) is the ninth ( 9th ) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into . Characters ANDY HARDY ( Mickey Rooney ) and JUDGE HARDY ( Lewis Stone ) were going to be front and center . The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks . The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in.<br /><br />Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner . The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do . Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve . ANDYs ' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way . Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY ( 1946 ) his reaction to any ' teapot tempest ' was the same , juvenile.<br /><br />In this film it is clearly illustrated . ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved . This screen writing device was known as the ' idiot plot ' . A means of stretching a poorly written scenario . Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys ' fault then the Director and the Writers . Most likely George B. Seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control Rooneys ' excesses . To see our overview of the entire series go to YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE ( 1937 ) .
0 I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Andy Hardy films . A couple of them were n't bad . Modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty , so goody - two shoes movies like these rarely get praise < br /><br />Nonetheless , I ca n't defend this movie either . You can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story . Watching this , you just shake your head ask yourself , " how stupid can you get ? " This is cornier than corny , if you know what I mean . It is so corny I can not fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour - and - a - half.<br /><br />The story basically is " Andy " ( Mickey Rooney ) trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from New York City as if that was the ultimate . People were a lot more social - conscious in the old days . You 'd hear the term " social - climber " as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life . It 's all utter nonsense , of course , and looks even more so today.<br /><br />However , it 's about as innocent and clean a story and series ( there were a half dozen of these Andy Hardy films made ) as you could find . Also , if you like to hear Judy Garland sing , then this is your ticket , as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into Andy 's heart . Oh man , I almost throw up even writing about this !
0 I am at a distinct disadvantage here . I have not seen the first two movies in this series , although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films . Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film . Judging it on it 's own , it was pretty boring.<br /><br />You never get a real good look at the maniac cop 's ( Robert Z'Dar ) face , but what I did see was pretty grim . The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film , not to give any thrills . Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director 's Cut , I may be more impressed.<br /><br />The ending with the car chase with Z'Dar , Caitlin Dulany , and Robert Davi was pretty intense . best part of the movie .
0 Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go - round , although I 'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans . Cordell , who died in the last flick , is resurrected through voodoo , and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of . I missed part of this early ' 90s low - budget quickie , but it was pleasing to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various , gruesome ways . Problem is , the overall film is pretty static , and Cordell simply ai n't Jason or Freddy . The interest wanes pretty fast , even with that grand B - movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled . Stick with the first film in the series , which is funny and scary and exciting , all at the same time .
0 The supernatural , vengeful police officer is back for a third installment , this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop . Standard stalk and slash picture , yet well acted and directed , thus making it oddly interesting and watchable , though the violence is n't for the squeamish ( especially the director 's cut which was originally given an " NC-17 " rating).<br /><br />*1/2 out of * * * *
0 Look , it 's the third one , so you already know it 's bad . And " Maniac Cop " was n't good enough to warrant the second installment , so you know it 's even worse . But how much worse ? Awful , approaching God - awful.<br /><br />When Maniac Cop goes on a killing spree , a reporter exclaims , " What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death." < br /><br />1 - - Rainbows are not black , and can never be . 2 - - Rainbows are harmless , and can never inflict pain or death . 3 - - A news reporter , one valuable to his agency , might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree . " A black rainbow of death " is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation.<br /><br />This is what you 're in for .
0 I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir , " Criss Cross . " I found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film . < br /><br />This movie is a " neo - noir " since it 's modern - day and it 's in color , two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status . < br /><br />The biggest negative to it , however , was n't the cinematography ( that was fine ) but the muddled storyline . Hey , some of ' 40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar but I did n't care for some of those either . The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes . No wonder it was the keep up with this story . It was ridiculous ! What happens is that by the 45-minute mark , their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore . I know I did n't .
0 There are n't many good things to say at all about Underneath , Soderbergh 's untrue endeavor into neo - noir . Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmak 's decent noir Criss - Cross faithfully , not altering the plot very much at all , however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state - of - the - art film noir atmosphere , giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places , lifestyles and anachronisms . Soderbergh , who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Ocean 's series with great style and atmosphere , takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest , dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s . Nightclubs have terrible , revoltingly dressed garage bands , Peter Gallagher 's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster 's anti - hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos , TVs , and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film.<br /><br />It could 've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score , more flesh to its characters , more than just William Fichtner giving performances that are n't wooden , a crisper pace . Unfortunately , Underneath has none of these things . Soderbergh , a fine director , does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time . That disposition works wonderfully when he 's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned , or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex , lies and videotape . With a movie like Underneath , it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer .
0 When i got this movie free from my job , along with three other similar movies .. I watched then with very low expectations . Now this movie is n't bad per se . You get what you pay for . It is a tale of love , betrayal , lies , sex , scandal , everything you want in a movie . Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster , but for cheap thrills it is not that bad . I would probably never watch this movie again . In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time , or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time . Despite the bad acting , cliché lines , and sub par camera work . I did n't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player . The story has been done many times in many movies . This one is no different , no better , no worse . < br /><br />Just your average movie .

0 Ben Masters,(Kyd Thomas),"Dream Lover",'86 plays a sort of Mike Hammer character , a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals . Kyd makes one big mistake when he stops Morgan Fairchild,(Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg),"Arizona Summer",'73 from getting beaten up and raped . Kyd takes Laura home to his pad and when he wakes up , she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home . By the way , Kyd sleep in his bed and Laura slept on the couch for this particular scene . Laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between Kyd and Laura .

0 Manipulative drama about a glamorous model ( Margaux Hemingway ) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician ( Chris Sarandon ) – to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister ( played by real - life sibling Mariel ) , whose music teacher he is . While the central courtroom action holds the attention – thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway ’s lawyer – the film is too often merely glossy , but also dramatically unconvincing : the jury ostensibly takes the musician ’s side because a ) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b ) she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together . What the f * * * ? ! ; she was clearly tied up – what resistance could she realistically offer ? < br /><br />The second half of the film – involving Sarandon ’s rape of the sister , which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE ( 2002 ) by occurring in a tunnel – is rather contrived : Mariel ’s character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister , but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately ! The climax – in which Sarandon gets his just desserts , with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante – is , however , a crowd - pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) ; incidentally , ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films.<br /><br />It ’s worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters’ lives took wildly different turns ( this was the film debut of both ) : Margaux ’s career never took off ( despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here ) – while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen ’s MANHATTAN ( 1979 ) and , interestingly , would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real - life “ Playboy ” centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse ’s STAR 80 ( 1983 ) . With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages , Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 ; chillingly , the Hemingway family had a history of suicides – notably the sisters’ grandfather , celebrated author Ernest , who died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound in 1961 .
0 After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago , I was curious to see the unedited version . I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered , but one thing really stood out . I think other reviewers have mentioned this also , namely , what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character ? Has he raped other victims before ? Is he completely psychotic or an " average " sociopath ? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister ? Is this character at all credible , or is it just a matter of more background being necessary ? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character , and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young , vulnerable girls . This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general . It has nothing to do with his performance , which is terrifyingly convincing . The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject , without quite settling into either mode . Not the worst movie ever made , but not all that good , either .
0 Model Chris McCormack ( Margaux Hemingway ) is brutally raped by a teacher ( Chris Sarandon ) of her sister Kathy ( Mariel Hemingway ) . He is brought to trial but goes totally free . He then rapes Kathy!<br /><br />Objectionable and sick rape film . This movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape . What it is is a badly written and ( for the most part ) badly acted drama . It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face . To be totally honest however , Hemingway 's acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had . The trial scenes were boring and predictable . And the movie just went too far when 15 year old Mariel is raped ( thankfully that was n't shown ) . I do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead . But seriously -- having a young girl raped is just revolting.<br /><br />Acting does n't help . For instance , Margaux was no actress . She was certainly a beautiful woman ( and an actual model I believe ) but her acting left a lot to be desired . It lessens the film . Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films . Sarandon does what he can as the rapist . He was n't bad but the terrible script worked against him.<br /><br />I do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people . I found this boring , simplistic and REALLY sick . A 1 all the way .
0 * * WARNING : POSSIBLE SPOILER**<br /><br />If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter , this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama . Surprisingly enough , this movie has been copied and ripped - off several times over the years , although it 's hard to fathom ANY filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama . Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here ( although Mariel HAS improved over the years ) , Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney , and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking , smarmy bad guy of the piece.<br /><br />Veteran director Lamont Johnson ca n't make a silk purse out of this sow 's ear of a script , which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations . For example , the final sequence , where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead . Add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure , even though you 're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it . Do n't say you were n't warned .
0 Lipstick is another glossy movie failure . I am trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie , and I am having trouble coming up with something . I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part . The writing and the script was not the worst that I have ever encountered , but it could have been a lot better . Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view . The sets were very glossy and nice to look at . The cast was okay . I felt like Anne Bancroft 's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie . It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one .
0 It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age . This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film . I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth , Iwill never forget it . I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made . I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified.<br /><br />I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie . I love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty . Rent some Rus Myer instead .
0 This film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it . But no , even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid . I found it as an offer in a magazine and that 's why I 've seen it . I regret the time I lost to see this . 1 out of 10 ( because they do n't have a lower grade ) .
0 If you have n't seen this , it 's terrible . It is pure trash . I saw this about 17 years ago , and I 'm still screwed up from it .
0 While some performances were good - Victoria Rowell , Adrienne Barbeau , and the two Italian girlfriends come to mind - the story was lame and derivative , the emphasis on the girlfriend 's racial background was handled clumsily at best , and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes , not as real people . I found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny . I can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in SF said this was a good movie , and wonder WHO posted the glowing review here on IMDb . Very disappointed in this movie , and mad I actually went to a theatre to see it , based on the faulty connection to Garden State , which is a far funnier , more inventive , and touching movie than this one . I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church , which was so wooden and by - the - numbers that I nearly left , and some in the audience actually DID . THAT was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard , which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened . I really do n't like being misled to spend my money so uselessly .
0 Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner Rip Off was actually in theaters . Along with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Director Stanley Kramer 's 1967 master piece . This present day rip off is a joke . So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home ( Insert GASP here ) to his grand father 's funeral . His family members reactions were of course .... predictable . This movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave . Do yourself a favor and rent the original . Take a pass on Wake .
0 This film is really vile . It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context . I 'm not saying that urban crime was n't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't / aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit . Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it 's not a case of social issues but a white , upper - middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol . And of course he knows how to play the system . Does that sound familiar . Yes . This turd is pure violent exploitation , a really nasty piece of work . It 's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment . This belongs in the same category as trash like Exterminator , Death Wish 2 - 5 and so on and so on . The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this .
0 The creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line , only to substitute with horrible special affects . This movie seemed to be focused on amusing children , but could n't even accomplish that . Many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies , but this movie is no where near that . Fortunately this will be another film easily made , and easily forgotten . This movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie . Anyone who has a shred of respect for films , should avoid seeing this movie at all costs .
0 Relying on the positive reviews above , we saw a free screening of this last night . Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews , because there is no way an objective individual could have written these . " Destined to become a ' cult classic ' " ? ? The theater was packed , apparently with friends and families of the production crew , because only a few of us walked out by the first hour.<br /><br />The songs were the most literal I 've ever heard in a musical  " do n't take the short cut , honey , there 's a wolf in the woods .. " . Debi Mazar 's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing . Fortunately , most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines.<br /><br />Now , whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive . Instead , we get Joey Fatone , ex N'Syncer , living up to his last name as he 's not aged well . He 's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school - quality makeup and out - of - tune singing . Seriously , this guy was in vocal group ? The rest of the actors are semi - adequate , but ca n't do much about the unimaginative script . You know , it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time  see under " Pixar".<br /><br />On the positive side , the virtual sets looked nice and were well - integrated with the actors . And it was n't as offensive as " Crash " .
0 Creepy & lascivious wolf . The young " Red " is wearing full make - up , and extremely short shorts & robe . Got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile 's dream come true . The " up - beat " music sounds a lot like something I 'd hear at a strip club . I actually think this movie is a sick joke - it 's not a family movie . Gross , glad I was watching this with my daughter , I do n't want her to think it 's normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together . Very bad , Very sad it 's sold as a family film , Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it . And what 's with advertising it as a " special effects spectacular " ? ? ? The effects do look low budget , gawd awful .
0 Just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid . If your child likes this film you 'd better have him / her tested . I am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad . This " film " is a showcase for digital wizardry AND NOTHING ELSE . The writing is horrid . I ca n't remember when I 've heard such bad dialogue . The songs are beyond wretched . The acting is sub - par but then the actors were not given much . Who decided to employ Joey Fatone ? He can not sing and he is ugly as sin.<br /><br />The worst thing is the obviousness of it all . It is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible . Great children 's movies are wicked , smart and full of wit - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years , Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past . But in the continual dumbing - down of American more are flocking to dreck like Finding Nemo ( yes , that 's right ) , the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and eye - crossing trash like Red Riding Hood .
0 This collection really sucks!<br /><br />I rented it , thinking I´d really would enjoy some good fighting . Man this sucked ! Quick flashy cuts , an extremely annoying speaker , and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened ( I´m thinking especially of Jet Li´s fight in Fists of legend and Jackie Chan´s fight from drunken master 2).<br /><br />And what´s the deal with those brawling streetfighters ? ! What´s so " cool " about that ? I´ve seen more interesting fights on Martial Law!<br /><br />This a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people.<br /><br />Do not ever buy this film ! Do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap!<br /><br />Instead , go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory !
0 The good thing about this that 's at least fresh : Almost no movies about dance music and the club scene ( if even made ) hit the cinemas . And it radiates lots of energy too , from the music to the portrayal of Ibiza.<br /><br />But the main problem is that it ca n't decide what it wants to be . Although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap , the makers also realized they would n't want to play copycat . However , it fails grossly on the jokes because it 's not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped . And it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes , so why not edit it down to 75 ? The production department and cinematography still try to save the day ( e.g. Paul 's home).<br /><br />In a strange way and unexpectedly so It 's all gone Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous . Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer some acting power.<br /><br />Conclusion : it 's a mess , it somewhat entertains at a basic level , but you better spend a night in your favorite club .
0 I do n't remember seeing another murder / mystery movie as bad as this . This movie , about a medical examiner who investigates his friend 's mysterious death in a car accident , has the complete receipt for a bad movie : bad acting , boring story , lack of suspense , poor humor and no drama . I remembered seeing this movie on PAX , a TV station notable for dishing out low - budgeted and campy made - for - TV movies such as this one . TV movies , of course , do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the Big Screen . But , this movie sure hit all sour tastes . The makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making " Receipe for Murder " a great TV movie ; the title does offer some suspense.<br /><br />So , if you want a good recipe , do n't watch this movie . This movie alone can kill your TV appetite.<br /><br />Grade F
0 The script is so so laughable ... this in turn , makes the actors ' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed . There 's repetition of phrases -- " my sweet little god daughter " and minor variations of that line which comes to mind ... and it 's just sloppy soap opera dialog.<br /><br />Worse yet , the music is so WRONG ! Plus , the main bluesy " theme " is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this . And it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation , texture and arrangement of this theme never changes , even when the scene 's emotional context does.<br /><br />Subsequently , whenever it appears , it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another.<br /><br />The music 's corny , and it 's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom -- a low budget 80 's Canadian sitcom at that -- and this makes it feel as if we 're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial.<br /><br />This is so miscast , there 's a lot of overacting and it 's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only ONE type of NY accent -- a thick Bronx accent . I do n't know if it 's a question of the actors ' limited capacity in only knowing * one * NY accent -- or whether it 's a question of the director 's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly.<br /><br />In the end , it 's the amateur script with it 's leaden lines which makes this entire " movie " ... blow . When any foundation is shaky and unstable , it 's impossible to build upon it without it 's flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways .
0 I had high expectations of this movie ( the title , translated , is " How We Get Rid of the Others " ) . After all , the concept is great : a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right - wing government 's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so - called freeloaders and the left wing in general , and decided to just kill off everyone who can not prove that they 're contributing something to the establishment ( the establishment being called " the common good " , but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology).<br /><br />Very cool idea ! Ideal for biting satire ! Only , this movie completely blows its chance . The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity , but this satire is not sustained ; it is neither sharp nor witty . And for an alleged comedy , the movie has nearly no funny scenes . The comedy , I assume , is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations , but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over - serious , rather than evoking either laughter or thought.<br /><br />The script is rife with grave errors in disposition . The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing , but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun , and who 's trying to save everybody , by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa . All this is beside the point ! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious ! It 's a satire ! A political statement . But it does n't even begin to actually address the problem it 's supposed to be about . Maybe it was afraid of going too far ? How cowardly . That 's not art . It 's not even real satire.<br /><br />Søren Pilmark , a very serious and by now one of Denmark 's absolutely senior actors , was very good . He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had . Everybody else : nothing special ( well , perhaps except for Lene Poulsen , who did supply a convincing performance).<br /><br />In fact , a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural . Neither the formulation nor the delivery . Why is it so difficult to make it sound right ? Why must it be so stilted and artificial ? I hope , when people look at these movies fifty years from now , they do n't think that this was how people talked in general Danish society.<br /><br />3 out of 10 .
0 This movie could have been great(cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise ) but it never rises above sheer caricature . The acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater . Never and I mean never Watch this godawfull piece of .... Danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of .... crosses the border I 'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie . This movie is the reason why i chose to register here . I really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of .... my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
0 They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery . Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are . The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character . This of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the Immortal Hills Cemetery . Come on now , could n't they have shown us just one of the death scenes ? We hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we do n't get to see anything . Some how I Bury The Living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone . Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better I movie , such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood .
0 There will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kiss ( technically ) another man on the lips . There will be a time where it wo n't be Duck or Rabbit season . There will be a time where the Tazmanian Devil will be dubbed politically incorrect.<br /><br />But so help me now is not that time.<br /><br />Nobody really wants an ' EXTREME ' version of our beloved Loony characters . Whoever it is in marketing who comes up with " Corn Nuts : Corn gone wrong " and " Extreme Doritos " and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever does n't mean they know jack about kids.<br /><br />I think that they 're doing a disservice to children , depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time . This show disgusts me , and it 's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue . They misuse good voice talent , like Phil Lamarr , Michael Clarke Duncan , Candi Milo , and so many others . It lacks style , humor , character development , and most importantly , heart.<br /><br />The show , like it 's repackaged characters ( Slam Tasmanian , Rev Runner , Ace Bunny ) is but a shadow of it 's former , timeless and beautiful self .
0 " Well Chuck Jones is dead , lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions , an American drawn anime knock off style , and give them superpowers " . " but sir ? , do n't we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this ? much less do n't dump all over their original creators dreams " . " yes ! and those shows make us a bunch of cash , and we need more ! " . " but wo n't every man women and child , who grew up with these time less characters , be annoyed ? " . " hay you 're right ! set it in the future , make them all descendent 's of the original characters , and change all the names slightly ... but not too much though , we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics".<br /><br />Well that 's the only reason I can think of why this even exists . If you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons , then it looks like an OK show . But then there is already the teen titan 's , which is the same bloody thing . All the characters are dressed like batman , they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains , they have superpowers , only difference is they sort of talk like the Looney tunes and have similar names and character traits.<br /><br />This kind of thing falls into the " it 's so ridiculous it 's good " kind of category . Think of the Super Mario brother 's movie , and Batman and Robin . If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons , check this out . If you are of the younger generation ( what this thing is actually intended for ) , and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness , then run with it and enjoy.<br /><br />If you enjoy this cartoon I do n't have a problem with you , it 's the people who calculated this thing together that I am mad at . You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car ; this show is like grave robbing . They might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon , shoved them on a display , dressed them up in  err pirate costumes , and charged money . If this show was n't using characters ( ones that did n't resemble the Looney Toons in anyway whatsoever ) that have already made the studios millions , then this would be fine . But no ! For shame Warner brothers , for shame.<br /><br />If I saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the Simpson 's or Family Guy , I would love it . As it is I just ca n't believe this was ever made . I would bet anyone that 80 % of the people who work on this show hate it . But whatever it does n't really matter , in 10 years this show will have been forgotten , while the originals will live on forever  or at least until the world ends.<br /><br />"Coming 2008 , Snoopy and the peanut gang are back , and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible ! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar ? Tune in and see . "
0 Loony Tunes have ventured ( at least ) twice into the future . The first time was with the brilliantly funny " Duck Dodgers " . The latter time was with this   um   effort . " Loonatics Unleashed " is n't without merit , and might be considered a good product were it not that it is n't up to Warner Brothers quality . WB cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor , appealing at least as much to adults as to children . These pedestrian superhero episodes , on the other hand , can not fail to convince adults to pass them up.<br /><br />The premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals ( 2 bunnies , a Tasmanian devil , a duck , a roadrunner , and a coyote ) live on the " city - planet " of Acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772 . What 's confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count - up to 2772 from the 21st Century . Cute , but frelling stupid.<br /><br />In each episode , the super sextet  amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter  fight various super villains . For the most part , these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones . Like many mediocre superhero series , this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context . And of course these guys are the only characters that laugh  the usual evil laugh , of course . Why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always  ALWAYS  laugh evilly at every opportunity ? Animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and ( occasionally ) their henchpeople and/or henchthings.<br /><br />In point of fact , the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get - go . The superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities , but sometimes not . The problem here is that we do n't see enough WB looniness . Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as " Bugs - like " . What we have here is basically the silly and drekish " Teen Titans " , including its overly " modern " animation " look " , but with animals . Feh.<br /><br />The other misstep by the program 's creators is ( or are ) the villains . As noted before , these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil - laugh bit excessively . Amazingly , the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock WB characters as well as the protagonists . Adding to the fun could have been , say , Jupiter Sam  as well as The Fudd , still hunting wabbits  as well as Tech E. Coyote converted into a really neurotic villain  and so on . Ah , the sadness of missed opportunities  .<br /><br />Sadly , this whole production has gone into too much overtime ( that is , a 2nd season ) . Nevertheless , we can rejoice that there 's something new out there for the 14-going - on-9 crowd . The rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of Duck Dodgers .
0 " Loonatics Unleashed " is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones . The " Loony Tunes " have many spin -offs and different versions , some were good , others not very much .But " Loonatics " it 's the worst .The concept is stupid and derivative of shows as " The Power Rangers " and " Teen Titans " . There was n't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made . The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic . This show just does n't work .This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this should n't have be nothing more than a bad joke . Lame ! Zero stars
0 I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed , why all the American animators thinks that the kids this days wants stupid GI JOE versions of good stories ? ? ? the Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history , but they were n't created to be Xtreme , i mean come on ! ! ! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without loosing it 's original charm , but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey ! ! ! kids loves superheroes right ? ? ? the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes but this time in superhero form , this does n't sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series , or the new justice league , the result ? ? ? bad copies of flash ( the road runner ) or superman ( who else ? ? ? bugs bunny ) the problem is that Looney Tunes were n't meant to be dramatic , the were supposed to be funny ! ! ! ! as i said before this series sucks , and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world ? ? ? this show tries to be dramatic and action packed , but that 's something that few series and anime are able to do , if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show watch Tiny Toons , that 's an example that it 's possible to bring back to life old characters , but with a good story and respecting the original roots . too bad that show is already dead , another corporate wise decision i suppose .
0 God , I am so sick of the crap that comes out of America called " Cartoons"!<br /><br />Since anime became popular , the USA animators either produce a cartoon with a 5-year - old - lazy - ass style of drawing ( Kappa Mikey ) or some cheep Japanese animation rip - off . ( Usually messing up classic characters ) No wonder anime is beating American cartoons ! < br /><br />They are not even trying anymore ! < br /><br />Oh , I just heard of this last night ; I live in the UK and when I found out this show first came out in 2005,well , I never knew the UK was so up - to - date with current shows .
0 This is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze . Kind of like Billy Jack I guess . However , whereas Billy Jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such . We are introduced to the star who is described as having learned Judo in the marines . I was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing , I really do n't remember any emphasis on Judo . As a result the antagonist , James Macarthur , makes reference to the Judo when he offers an excuse for why he , a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated . Lame .
0 I saw this movie in NEW York city . I was waiting for a bus the next morning , so it was 2 or 3 in the morning . It was raining , and did not want to wait at the PORT AUTHORTY . So I went across the street and saw the worst film of my life . It was so bad , that I chose to stay and see the whole movie , I have yet to see anything else that bad since . The year was 69,so call me crazy . I stayed only because I could not belive it .........
0 I saw this recent Woody Allen film because I 'm a fan of his work and I make it a point to try to see everything he does , though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort . They were right . This is a confused movie that ca n't decide whether it wants to be a comedy , a romantic fantasy , or a drama about female mid - life crisis . It fails at all three.<br /><br />Alice ( Mia Farrow ) is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children . This rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old Chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs , and the ghost of a former lover ( with whom she flies over Manhattan ) . If these additions sound too fantastic for you , how about something more prosaic , like an affair with a saxophone player?<br /><br />I was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say . There are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film , and the endingis a really preposterous touch of Pollyanna.<br /><br />Rent ' Crimes and Misdemeanors ' instead , a superbly well - done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals . Or go back to " Annie Hall " or " Manhattan " .
0 Why would a person go back to a person , who kicks them in the teeth , not once , not twice , but over and over again.<br /><br />This film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse ( not just forgive it , but fully accept it ) . Gosh ! No wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years . I obviously was n't embracing my inner masochist.<br /><br />As Bucatinsky 's writing debut , there are many wonderful aspects to this film ; however , in order to justify the reunion of Eli and Tom , more character development would have been helpful . We are never acquainted with Eli 's masochism , in fact , we are led to believe that he is not a masochist , although Tom 's psycho - emotional sadism is highly evident .
0 I thought this was a truly awful film -- I found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times . One or both of the gay male leads was miscast ; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he 'd rather be kissing a dog . The movie covers their long and tortured courtship , highlighting each break - up and make - up , but not developing the reasons in - between in any detail . These reasons would make for some interesting characters , not the fight or the make - up scene in bed ( lame even if you liked the movie).<br /><br />Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters , but it does n't make the film worth renting . Save your money .
0 Demi Moore 's character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks . That was a bad start and the movie went down from there . The plot was totally unbelievable . The will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough . This movie did not convince me of a woman 's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required.<br /><br />Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone 's intelligence . The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting .
0 I 'll be short and to the point . This movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature IQ . Sorry liberals , feminists , etc . No women will ever be a Seal . They can forget about the draft or being in combat too . Ai n't going to happen . You see , hard as it is to understand or accept , men and women are physically different . Regardless of the fact it is 2007,reality can not change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt . Men ca n't give birth or breast feed babies ( Oh - I forgot about San Franfreako ) .<br /><br />Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations . How many women play in the NFL or NHL ? Lastly , I could n't give a bloody hoot in hell if what I just wrote upsets you . Come to think of it - if this does upset you that only warms my heart more . I did n't write one thing that was n't the truth . This imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that .
0 Watching this movie was a waste of time . I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie , but I resisted . I do n't know what Ridley Scott intended , but I learned that in the army , women get as stupid as men . They learn to spit , to insult and to fight in combat , and that 's also a waste of time ( in my opinion ) . And , anyway , what the hell was that final scene in Lybia ? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it that it 's easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger ?
0 After reading through many of the reviews , I do n't know what movie some people were watching , but clearly it was n't the same one I saw.<br /><br />This movie is horrible . The acting , primarily Moore 's , is just terrible . The woman can not act . Nice tits , but she just ca n't act . At no point did she come across as the actual character . Instead , it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make - believe with the boys.<br /><br />And that 's what this movie ultimately is -- Hollywood make - believe . The training sequences are over the top . The politics -- over the top . The political correctness -- over the top . The combat scenes -- you guessed it , over the top . Your mission is to get in and get out without being detected . So what do you do ? Why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible , of course . Oh G.I. Jane , you can be my wing man anytime.<br /><br />The premise is good , but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it , we end up with Top Gun with tits.<br /><br />What more is to be expected from commercial US films anymore ? Not much I guess .
0 Naturally I did n't watch ' GI Jane ' out of choice . I was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex - girlfriends house.<br /><br />GI Jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario , which of course it is n't . The result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints , restricting the amount of humour ( of which there is none ) or entertaining action scenes , and soon becomes too serious . The film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable.<br /><br />'GI Jane ' fails where other action films succeed , mainly because films such as James Bond , Dirty Harry and various others are larger than life , yet never proclaim to be otherwise . They are escapism , and therefore entertaining . ' GI Jane ' tries to be real and fails.<br /><br />This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott , with a very non - credible storyline , unremarkable acting , and the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work .
0 I think that movie can`t be a Scott`s film . That is impossible . Do you remember Blade Runner ? And Alien ? Two greats movies versus a one . I hope didn´t see ever it . good bye ! !
0 < br /><br />How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me . The script is so banal , and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon . The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising , and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed . Demi Moore however , shows none a surprise by participating in this film , if one looks at her tracklist . All in all , a " high concept " style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of .
0 A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background , contained the comment " A woman 's life is no more valuable than a man's".<br /><br />This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show . Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population , sometimes with astonishing speed . Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed . In South America 's War of the Triple Alliance ( 1865 ) , Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.<br /><br />No society , however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population . Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight . Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.<br /><br />"G.I. Jane " is Hollywood fluff .
0 Hmmm ... where to start ? How does a serious actress like Demi Moore got involved in such crap ? " First blood " might be rated as bull***t but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits , point . Of course if you are interested in the crapstory ( Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals ) that is the most stupid cliché one I can think of , you 'll say " GI Jane " is a great movie . Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell , I ca n't think of Demi Moore being Rambo ( especially not during the last , useless , 30 minutes ) . Ridley Scott does n't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights , it 's just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it . Awful movie .
0 A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott . G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs . The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character O'Neil played by Demi Moore . There is no particular message or point in this film or then I could n't reach it properly . It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.<br /><br />I really ca n't understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert ? ! It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique . When I look at his latest film , Black Hawk Dawn , there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes ( which are plenty ) and they are very intense and directed with skill . The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing.<br /><br />This is Ridley Scott 's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known . Still I 'm glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scott 's abilities , but they are very few in this film.<br /><br />A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics ( Blade Runner , Thelma & Louise , Alien and so on .. ) of this talented director . So I 'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10 .
0 This movie is very much like " Flashdance " , you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals . That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it 's not even bad enough to be funny . " G.I. Jane " is much better than that film , but that does n't say much . Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there 's high music and we get to see her fight and everything , but it is certainly not very engaging . I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting , but the script is too clichéd and Ridley Scott ca n't do anything about that . Well , like I said ... It 's better than " Flashdance " ... ( 4/10 )
0 This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film . Ridley Scott is a wonderful director . But this film is a black mark on his career . Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen , both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army . Very stupid . And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way . It is really not difficult to make a film such as this . Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody . The writers did n't have much inspiration either ; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all ; and some brainless action . I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish . I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention , and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess .
0 This film 's basic premise is a political cartoon . I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a " feel - good " film on gender equality . Indeed a recent commentator stated : " it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do . " What claptrap ! No one , man or woman can do anything they want to do , and unfortunately Demi Moore " buffing " up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD / S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so . There is approximately an 80 % dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out , ca n't compete on a physical level , suffer frequent physical injury during the training or ca n't handle the psychological harassment . I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived , purported message of this film . In the real world , Demi would n't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training . Wishing alone wo n't do it . Skip this film as wishful thinking , and better spend your time reading " The Warrior Elite " by Dick Couch ( Crown , New York 2001)for the best description as to what really goes on in this training . Ring the bell , Demi!<br /><br / >
0 This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s , Jack Pearl ( radio 's " Baron Munchausen " ) as well as Jimmy Durante . However , 7 - 1/2 decades later , it 's being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today . Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.<br /><br />As for the Stooges , this is a film from there very early days -- before MGM had any idea what to do with the team . At this point , they were known as " Ted Healy and his Stooges " as Healy was the front man . Fortunately for the Stooges , they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man ( read up on him -- you'll see what I mean ) and the rest is history . Within a year , they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team . This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM , a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy ( such as the films of Buster Keaton , Laurel and Hardy , Abbott and Costello and others ) . In fact , up until they left for Columbia , MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles -- including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY . And , oddly , in this film they did n't act as a team -- they just did various supporting roles , such as Larry playing the piano!<br /><br />This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle . When they are rescued and brought home , all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show -- punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there . As for Pearl , I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films , as he has the personality of a slug ( but slightly less welcome ) . As for Durante , I never knew what the public saw in him -- as least as far as his films are concerned -- he was loud and ... loud ! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keaton 's career to make this film . Together , Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor ( ? ) and Vaudeville - style routines that tend to fall rather flat.<br /><br />In this film , the Stooges they did n't yet have the right chemistry . Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd . What they did in the film was pretty good , but because all the segments were short , they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines . Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this , though die - hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life - long goal of seeing everything Stooge -- even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films ( oh , and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly).<br /><br />Overall , the film is rather dull and disappointing . However , there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess . At about the 13 minute mark , you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing . Look carefully , as this is Walter Brennan in a role you 'd certainly never expect ! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the " Clean as a Whistle " song starting at about 22 minutes into the film . This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so - called " Pre - Code " scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 ( when the Production Code was strengthened ) . Despite the word " Clean " in the title , it 's a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh -- enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything ! It 's quite shocking when seen today , though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s . Finally , at the 63 minute mark , see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades . See the film , you 'll see that I mean !
0 Strained comedy , a sketch - like revue which was initially a vehicle to showcase one - time radio star Jack Pearl but is now best remembered as America 's introduction to The Three Stooges . Actually , Larry , Curly and Moe are billed alongside comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges . Although the supporting cast features Jimmy Durante ( who is completely wasted on dim material ) and ZaSu Pitts , the only audience for the film these days are Stooges - addicts , and even they wo n't find much to applaud here . Incredibly loud and overbearing , it shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Oh , brother . The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total " bomb " from me is because it 's at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film ( when they were n't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy ) . But even as a longtime Stooges fan I 'd have to say that young Moe , Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr. Healy 's taller boss janitor . They 're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on - and - off - again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing.<br /><br />Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen ( here 's a good example of the level of humor : " I object ! " " On what grounds ? " " Coffee grounds ! " ) . His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante , but even the schnoz himself is a bore .
0 Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time . There are a lot of films I do n't like which , for some unfathomable reason , I 've felt the urge to review . However , if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film I 've ever seen , look no further than Transylvania 6 - 5000 . Without question , this takes the title of the all - time no . 1 awful film . I ca n't believe that I actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finish!<br /><br />It is clearly meant to capture the flavour of Mel Brooks 's Young Frankenstein , but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions , this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material . Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day Transylvania ( perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud ) . During their research , they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites , such as vampires , werewolves and mummies.<br /><br />Anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom . It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way , it results in awesomely dire entertainment .
0 Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century . Way before the ' Scary Movie ' series there were a few examples of this genre , mostly in the 80s . But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss . Some like ' Elvira , Mistress of the Dark ' mostly rise above that , but other like ' Saturday the 14th ' and it 's sequel fail to deliver the laughs . But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that 's ' Transylvania 6 - 5000 , ' a major waste of time for many reasons.<br /><br />Pros : A great cast that does it 's best . Some of the dopey humor is amusing . A corny , but catch theme song . Some good Transylvanian locations.<br /><br />Cons : Threadbare plot . Mostly tedious pacing . Most of the humor just does n't cut it . The monsters are given little to do and little screen time . I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies ? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry.<br /><br />Final thoughts : This is a comedy ? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between ? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor , not roll our eyes and yawn , aching for it to be over . I ca n't believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk . I 'll admit it 's not one of the worst films ever made , but it 's not worth anyone 's time or money even if you 're a fan of any of the actors . See ' Transylvania Twist ' instead.<br /><br />My rating : 2/5
0 " Transylvania 6 - 5000 " is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80 's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script . Two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent , very much against their will , to Transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein . There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film , like a little guillotine for hard - boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table . The wholesome of the film , however , is not as successful as it could and should have been , with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong . The Roger Corman production " Transylvania Twist " , which came out four years after this , is a lot funnier and much more recommended . The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30 's , so you better make sure you 've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references . There 's a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a mad - raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory . It 's also revealed that he 's actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah who 's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters . Michael Richards , the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld , stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments . I 'm pretty sure John Turturro 's character in " Mr. Deeds " was inspired by Richards 's role here .
0 This comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it , surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff . Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time . And the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this , or they were simply making it all up as they went along . ( * 1/2 )
0 I saw this movie originally in the theater , when I was 10 . Even at that age the ' humor ' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence.<br /><br />In the past , whenever I would see Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad . Until I was reminded of the existence of this movie today , I was unsure why I felt that way . Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained . Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen , nay EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work.<br /><br />I have n't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult . I imagine that as part of the healing process that I should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that I can * truly * put it behind me . Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either .
0 Were I not with friends , and so cheap , I would have walked out . It failed miserably as satire and did n't even have the redemption of camp .
0 I give this five out of 10 . All five marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material . Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling ! We have countless full - face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything , taking a pee perhaps ? We do n't see his hands on the guitar that s the point ! Also we 're given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind ? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix , but amateur fools operate all of them . The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction . While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that s bleeding out the amps ( the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider ) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun , complete waste of film ! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes . The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
0 Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am always interested in seeing , despite reviews . I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles , and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching.<br /><br />I say " nearly " and " almost " in large part because of this movie.<br /><br />First off , Meg Ryan does not play a likeable character , she plays a weak - willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and does n't give up until several days later . That said , Kevin Kline 's character is even more annoying and less likeable . So , even if you normally like these two actors , I recommend your give this movie a pass .
0 The premise is ridiculous , the characters unbelievable , the dialogue trite , and the ending absurd . < br /><br />Believe me , I 'm a fan of Kevin Kline , but watching him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed Frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds.<br /><br />For her part , Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a ( take your pick ) : kewpie doll , baby , puppy , kitten , whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth . She also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being.<br /><br />This movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to vacation in Paris and the south of France while being well - paid for it . So I ca n't really blame them .
0 Un - bleeping - believable ! Meg Ryan does n't even look her usual pert lovable self in this , which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick . Hard to believe she was the producer on this dog . Plus Kevin Kline : what kind of suicide trip has his career been on ? Whoosh ... Banzai ! ! ! Finally this was directed by the guy who did Big Chill ? Must be a replay of Jonestown - hollywood style . Wooofff !
0 The film looks super on paper . A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross - breeding gold , especially with this excellent romcomic cast.<br /><br />I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves . Adam Brooks ' script may well be to blame but you 'd expect better from the Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda . Instead the two ping - pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around France.<br /><br />Jean Reno co - stars amiably as the cop - with - a - heart and I guess wishes he was a star - with - a - part . Mind you he went on to do those Pink Panther remake(s ! ) so perhaps he was OK with this ... 3/10
0 One of the those " coming of age " films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids . This movie has neither . It is a poor excuse to let Sylvia Kristel 's body double frolic with a dorky Eric Brown . To make matters worse , the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny , sexy , or dramatic . Laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard . Ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double . As the movie went on and on , I started to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP . Watch this to laugh at other people 's stupidity , or for Ed Begley Jr. 's committed performance , or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt . But I can give you an idea of your lesson , stay away from movies staring Sylvia Kristel that are not Emmanuelle .
0 Let 's put political correctness aside and just look at this in terms of the numerous sex comedies that came out in the 1980 's because I for one do n't think this is any better or any worse than the others . Unless your some religious kook or an uptight female you can probably view a silly film such as this without getting all worked up about the content and I personally had a totally innocuous feeling towards this before and after watching it . Story is set in Albuquerque , New Mexico where a rich 15 year old boy named Phillip " Philly " Fillmore ( Eric Brown ) is naturally horny as hell and starts spying on the attractive maid that has just started working for his father.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT * * * * * Nicole Mallow ( Sylvia Kristel ) is friendly to Philly but things heat up when his father goes out of town on business and she starts to flirt with him to the point where she invites him into her bedroom to watch her undress . Philly is awkward and does n't know how to react at first but soon he goes for it and has sex but than to his horror it seems that Nicole has died from a heart attack ! With the help from the sleazy chauffeur Lester Lewis ( Howard Hesseman ) they seemingly have buried her body but a note from a blackmailer shows up and Philly must get $ 10,000 out of his father 's safe . Philly is shocked when Nicole shows up and he learns that the whole thing was an extortion plan set up by Lester and that she only went along with it because she 's an illegal alien and if she did n't do what she was told Lester would have called the immigration office . Together they try to get his father 's money back before he returns home and they enlist the help from Jack ( Ed Begley Jr. ) who is a tennis instructor but pretends to be a cop to scare Lester.<br /><br />This little comedy was made for less than $ 3 million but it grossed over $ 50 million worldwide and made it one of the least likely films during that time to be so successful which prompts me to wonder why this was a hit and not any of the others in the genre . Director Alan Myerson can boast that he made a hit film but the truth is that he never really had a career in films although he did go on to be very successful in television . So ... why did this become so successful ? I have a thought that it just may be because of Kristel and before you decide that I 'm crazy listen to my reasoning . Kristel was an international star because of her soft core films so that reason alone made many free thinking adults curious about viewing her in an American film that was getting a wide release . With that , the same adults would also be nostalgic about their own youth and the fantasy of being taught the ways of lovemaking by an attractive older woman which brings in the much younger audience members who are probably still very inexperienced and curious about the film . Anyway , that 's my thought and if anyone has another reason I would love to hear it but back to the film itself it 's apparent ( and very sad ) that a film like this could probably never get made again ( except in Europe ) because of the religious right and the other prudish freaks who just ca n't come to terms with the fact that a teenage boy getting laid will not do him any harm . In fact , it 's a valuable service that ALL BOYS pray will happen to them ! The film itself is clumsy and Kristel 's body double is all too evident in certain scenes especially if you take careful note of the difference in their nipples . The story ( although intriguing in it 's basic form ) is neither very funny or revealing so were left ogling the nude scenes that are really the norm for the genre .
0 Back in my days as an usher " Private Lessons " played at the 4-plex I was working . It was a sleeper hit selling out Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks . I never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend , so I decided to give it a shot . What I witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />The basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid ( Sylvia Kristel ) . She , too , seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons . So we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch . And it goes from there.<br /><br />Eric Brown , as the teenage boy , has to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen . His " scared " reactions to every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible . I did n't laugh a single time during this piece of junk.<br /><br />And let 's not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid . Let 's just say it involves faking a death , burying a body .... I could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous.<br /><br />The sex scenes are the worst I have ever seen . Even though Eric Brown was older then he looked , the fact is he looks like a baby . It appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman ( if THAT was acting then maybe I should re - think my criticisms of Brown ) and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic . I have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though Miss Kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes.<br /><br />**SPOILER WARNING * * I must make mention of the last scene . To me it 's just plain sick but I can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits . Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers . He asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise has just asked her out . She nods affirmatively and he walks away , smiling at the camera in triumph . GIVE ME A BREAK ! Yes I am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid.<br /><br />I will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982 . Certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office . And to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country . THAT is a scary thought .
0 It is obviously illegal . Pedophiles pray on stuff like this . How did they get away with making such a movie ? This movie is all summed up in one word , SICK . Where do people get off making , and watching these kinds of films . As I was watching the movie I did n't actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman . Sorry if this is a spoiler to you but I would have rater not seen this . Where has the sanity of these people gone ? Maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles ? Our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children , yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior . I noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked . This is a kid here , and someone is asking something like this ? What is wrong with this picture ?
0 A previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad . What ? ! ? ! ? ! The movie glorifies child molestation . Oh , but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it , so let 's give it 5 out of 10 stars . Why not a full 10 ? Because the filmography was " agonizing , " the child 's looks of shock were " unrealistic , " and the fat friend was " irritating . " Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman . I happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime . To me , even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an Oscar , I would still have to give the movie only 1 star . That TV 's Howard Hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in WKRP is particularly ridiculous . But do n't take my word for it !
0 A woman ( Sylvia Kristel ) seduces a 15 year old boy ( Eric Brown ) . They have sex ... but it 's all tied into some stupid plot or something.<br /><br />Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever . Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation ? I suppose it 's OK cause it 's a teenage boy -- if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would ( rightfully ) be outrage . Sorry , but having it done to a boy does n't excuse it . It 's still sick . I realize Brown was of age ( he was actually 18 when this was made ) but he LOOKS 15 . I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK.<br /><br />Plot aside the acting sucks ( Kristel is beautiful -- but ca n't act ; Brown is easily one of the worst child actors I 've ever seen ) and the constant nudity gets boring and is n't even remotely erotic.<br /><br />I saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 . I was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin ( who could easily pass for 18 ) . HE wanted to see it -- I did n't but I decideD what the heck ? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage . My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through ! Let me make this clear -- three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity ! That should give you an idea of how bad this is . I 'm surprised this was ever released . A 1 all the way .
0 I remember that show . I still remember that kick ass fun song " America 's Funniest People . " Frankly it should 've been titled American 's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting People . Dave could n't save this show and neither could Bob Saget or the replacement hosts for AFV that came later . The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes Dave could make some good voice overs that were better than Bob 's . But this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted . Also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the Olson Twins . Plus AFV was in it 's prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner . Did I mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame ? But still the theme song rocks !
0 This was a rip - off of the same garbage we had to watch Bob Saget host during the half - hour before this . Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America 's Funniest Home Videos except with a hosts who have a combined IQ of three . Tawny Kitaen must 've really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes . It was torture enough having to see him imitate Popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on Full House . That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a Grade A wedgie . Coulier must 've needed to money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating .
0 As many agree , Origin is a beautiful anime artistically . The music , graphics , and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works . However , if you are looking for more than this , than I suggest looking else where . The beauty stops short of its appearance , and when it really comes down to plot and characters , there 's nothing special . Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat , corny at times , and do not act realistically . Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there ... So , in summary , oh my goodness , I 've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one ; and oh my goodness , it 's like ... -poke- people do n't act like that . It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime , but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization , and unfortunately , there 's not even that much action to make up for that ...
0 As seems to be the general gist of these comments , the film has some stunning animation ( I watched it on blu - ray ) but it really falls short of any real depth.<br /><br />Firstly the characters are all pretty dull . I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito , Toola and the main antagonist Shunack . However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking ( Laputa being my favourite animé , original Engilsh dub ) . The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly , leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected ( she loves Agito , who seems oblivious of this ) . However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more " happy " . < br /><br />There is also a serious lack of explanation . Like who are the druids really ? Are they people ? and who are the weird women / girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest ? There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers . The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this . It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids.<br /><br />And who does call Toola ? why bother with this if it wo nt be explained?<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki . I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I had n't bought it . My advice ? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare , but borrow it , or buy it cheap ! Perhaps if your new to animé films and do n't have much to go by you will enjoy it . It certainly is visually pleasing .
0 Seeing as I hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed , I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible . Downright terrible . And not , surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review . I thought I might agree with him , seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved , but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said . I am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie " definitely lacks good - looking females . " Let me be the first to say , " Wow ! that was definitely some serious in - depth reviewing there . My mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie . " Seriously though , a lack of " good - looking females " should n't be considered an essential to a movie . If you 're desperate enough for " good - looking females " you should really watch other types of movies , not necessarily falling into the sci - fi category .
0 No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series , of which only 3 have been on so far is awful . The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series . I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous . As a BBC licence payer , after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment . I 'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did n't object to the story lines . These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons , surly they can see it 's lost all direction . It 's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley , West Yorkshire , England .
0 I feel like I 've just watched a snuff film .... a beautifully acted , taut , engrossing and horrible thing ! A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word , sexual violence and torture , rape , decapitation , incest , corruption , live burial , and abuse , abuse , abuse . No redemption whatsoever . And I WAS entertained . I could n't stop watching . What does this say about me , about the people who make and act in this sort of thing , and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm . And I 'm neither puritanical nor humorless , I do n't try to hide from the existence of darkness , and I definitely have not led a sheltered life , but I am ashamed of myself . AND I 'm sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject - matter sewers the way my own tribe does . It does n't have to be cozy , but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism ?
0 I absolutely hate this programme , what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ? ? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I 'm well out of the room before it comes on . Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i ca nt stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless . What happened to detective programmes with real mystery ? ? ? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago ? ? ? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this .
0 I am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen . Slow , badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing ! McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless . They seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea . The plot is DULL ! ! i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one ! ! If you avoid one film this year .... let it be
0 Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past , like ' Greedy ' and ' Clue ' . This is n't one of them . More akin to a ' Police Academy ' film than its inspiration , it stars Steve Martin in the old Phil Silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors . But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko in the act . Nothing much happens , really . It 's all quite dull . It 's not very funny . Martin , Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort , but they 're all better than this and it 's quite painful watching them work with such thin material .
0 OK I 'm not an American , but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not , never has been , and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction . Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man , no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies America has ever produced . How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me . To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martin 's unfunny attempt to be Peter Seller 's Inspector Clouseau , another abortive attempt , in my opinion , to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career . Some of your contributers say ' Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character ' , to that I would say ' balderdash ' , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured for generations to come
0 Maybe I 'm really getting old , but this one just missed me and the old Funny Bone completely . Surely there must be something powerful wrong with this Irishman ( that 's me , Schultz ! ) . Lordy , lordy what I would give to see the light ! Firstly , that Phil Silvers manic energy , wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life , if you will . Although it is possible that the series , first titled : " YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH " ( 1955 - 59 * ) could have gotten on the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt . Bilko , it is very hard to picture any other Actor / Comedian in the business wearing those Master Sergeant 's stripes.<br /><br />Such a strong identification is inescapable , though not the same sort of career - wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys , like Clayton More("THE LONE RANGER " ) , George Reeves ( " THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN " ) and Charles Nelson Riley ( " UNCLE CROC 'S BLOCK").<br /><br />One major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950 's TV Screen to the 1990 's Movie - going public is our collective memory . Without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals , and their numbers were surely considerable ; even a large segment of the young had seen Bilko reruns in recent times . It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles ; or even light years apart.<br /><br />So as not to be thought of as a totally square , old grouch please let 's consider some other points.<br /><br />Right here today , the 14th Day of November In The Year of Our Lord 2007 , let me swear and affirm under Oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for nearly 30 years , Furthermore , I 've enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko ' 96 Co - Stars Dan Akroyd and the Late Phil Hartman . After all , it was the talents of guys like this and so many others , Alumni of " NBC;s Saturday NIGHT " and " SECOND CITY TV " that kept the last quarter of the 20th Century laughing . But a BILKO re - make ; it just did n't click.<br /><br />Perhaps if the film had been made as a Service Comedy ( always liked ' em ! ) but without the Bilko Show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby , old guys like me.<br /><br />So , we 've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately , what 's next ? Howse about somebody doing Hal Roach 's World War II Army Comedy Series of Sergeants DOUBLEDAY & AMES and TV 's 1st Cartoon Series " CRUSADER RABBIT " ? Remember where you heard it first ! POODLE SCHNITZ !
0 This may or may not be the worst movie that Steve Martin has ever made , but it certainly was far from his best . Obviously , he did this crap for the pay check . Dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man . What he does n't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie , they expect to be entertained , not bored to tears . It 's sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman down with him . I do n't understand why talented people ca n't get a grip on the fact that people do n't want to see them in lousy movies . If you 're going to call a movie a comedy , then it should be funny . This was n't . Shame on the US military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum , too . Full Metal Jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a " service comedy . " Surely , Phil Silvers is rolling over in his grave .
0 For 50 years after world war 2 the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests . At the same time , because of the draft and wars , everyone in society had served , or was connected to someone who had.<br /><br />This allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of American cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine . Sometimes that machine was non - US military , for example in prisoner of war situations . Once removed are stories in other machines : science fiction and corporate , but they always reference this military genre , and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling.<br /><br />You can trace it , I think , perhaps starting in the comic , meaning Amrican , sections of " The Great Escape , " which immediately spawned TeeVee offspring in " Gomer Pyle " and " Hogan 's Heros . " Then a second wave triggered by " Catch 22 " and " MASH , " both of which had been real life , then books , then movies , and in the MASH case , then TeeVee.<br /><br />But before all that , there was the " Phil Silvers Show , " about a Sergeant Bilko and this followed from " Mister Roberts . " A happy con man , who only committed harmless crimes , and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life . This was in the day when TeeVee shows mattered . You absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about . It was n't particularly clever in any way , except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom . < br /><br />Its one large zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgivable , even endearing lies in a military context , a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here.<br /><br />Because its big , it sometimes pays off in laughs . " Stripes " was pretty darn funny I thought . It had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes , sort of folding in some " Dirty Dozen . " And sexual adventure.<br /><br />Now this , well before the cultural wars escalated . It tries to touch that sweet spot , like other remakes that manhandled Steve Martin . It is so unfunny , you actually root for the Army to be the stronger player . Yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power.<br /><br />Ted 's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 : You can find something better to do with this part of your life .
0 I know I 've already added a comment but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /><br />I'm not some old fogey from the Baby Boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b / w picture of Phil Silvers , Jackie Gleason etc.<br /><br />Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver 's Bilko courtesy of BBC2 . I wonder if I would have enjoyed Steve Martin 's travesty if I had n't seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I do n't know - maybe I would have.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a ' 10 ' admit that they have n't seen the original . I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode . If after watching the original Ernie , Colonel Hall , Ritzig & Emma , Duane Doberman , Henshaw , Dino , Flashman , Zimmerman , Mullin et al you still think that Steve Martin 's film is woth anything above a ' 2 ' - I 'll stand you a pint ....
0 Steve Martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy . He absolutely does not fit this part . Like the woeful remake of the Out Of Towners , this movie falls flat on it 's face . How anybody ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to Jack Lemmon 's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie . Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko part better . Martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people 's classic work . It 's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over . The line " The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the United States Army " was just about the only line that actually made me laugh . If you want to see the real Bilko , get hold of the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show . Those are guaranteed to make you laugh , unlike this mistake that should never have happened . I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho . None of them should ever have happened .
0 This was a disappointing movie . Considering the material --- army life is always good for a laugh --- and the stars , this movie should have been a fall down laughfest . It was worth a couple of chuckles , at best . Steve Martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles , where he might follow Robin Williams ' lead and someday win an Oscar .
0 Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could n't save this movie from laying an emu - sized egg . Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series , it bombed because : A ) It was updated to the 1990s , and B ) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing , feeble and silly screenplay.<br /><br />The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks . To expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble , and it shows . No one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time .
0 When I say " Doctor Who " you might conjure up an image of Tom Baker , or Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison . When I say " James Bond " you`ll almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small handful of people may think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan . But when I say " Sgt Bilko " absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers . Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor . And that`s the problem with this film version you`ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show . In fact the whole idea of making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
0 This film is a pure failure . I am a Steve Martin fan , but even he ca n't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script . Think " Police Academy 7 " and apply it to a military parody . Yuck.<br /><br />I DO NOT feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received ( and rightfully deserved ! ) . It is extremely misleading . I have often seen this film marked down to $ 3.00 in the grocery store and now I certainly know why.<br /><br />If only I could get my 90 minutes back ...
0 I am watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel that the TV was turned to when I turned it on . It is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister 's wife ( Alexandra Paul ) falling in lust with a young stud / drifter ( with washboard abs ) played by Corey Sevier . There may or may not be a plot . Corey whips his shirt off a lot and Alexandra swoons . I 'm getting the feeling he 's supposed to be up to no good , and that 's why he 's messing with skinny Alexandra Paul . It 's not really important because as I said he takes his shirt off a lot and I just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage . There 's a lot of sax on the soundtrack , which is just painful .
0 I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i 've had in a long while . The plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way . The only plus to be found anywhere in the film are Corey Savier 's impressive abs . Alexandra Paul ( i think that 's her name ) is horrendous as the preacher 's wife who has a history of depression . Ted McKenzie is gross and his character 's a twit on top of it all . And as if the fact that you think she 's having sex with her son is n't enough , they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity ! The end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable . I mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him !
0 This movie is so bad it 's good -- in an unintentionally funny way . I could n't stop watching it , I was laughing so much ! It 's like a parody of a romantic thriller , except it 's not a parody . < br /><br />Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell , an oppressed preacher 's wife who falls hard for Luke ( Corey Sevier ) , a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison ; the only thing Sevier is guilty of , though , is bad acting ! Mind you , he 's no worse than the other actors . You get the sense that the actors have * no * idea they 're in a really awful film ; they 're playing it straight . Everything about the film is bad : the acting , the script , the love scenes , the pacing , the plot twists , the choice of music . The climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church , then Luke 's final words to Emily -- I was howling with laughter . < br /><br />Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison , and we get to see plenty of his naked torso . That 's probably the highlight of the film .
0 An Italian / American co - production co - starring Linda Blair and David ' The Hoff ' Hasselhoff : how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?<br /><br />Well , based on the uneventful , extremely tedious , and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so , I would have said ' very easily ' ; thankfully , however , things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes , and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy , a smattering of nudity too ( unfortunately , my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).<br /><br />The Hoff stars as Gary , a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie ( Leslie Cumming ) to a run - down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project , a book about witches ; whilst there , frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.<br /><br />His plans for nookie are scuppered , however , by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks ( Robert Champagne and Annie Ross ) , their pregnant daughter Jane ( Blair ) , son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland ) , and estate agent Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , who have come to inspect the island 's hotel.<br /><br />After explaining their unexpected presence on the island , Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property 's new owners , and when a violent storm suddenly picks up , making it perilous to return to the mainland , everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building . Unfortunately , unbeknownst to the hotel 's new guests , the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch ( Hildegard Knef ) , who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life . One by one , victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex ( which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs ) , before meeting a terrible fate.<br /><br />None of this makes much sense , and the acting is atrocious ( Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad , whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers , which speaks volumes about the others ) , but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore : Rose has her lips sewn together , before being roasted alive in a fireplace ; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive ; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish ( ! ! ) ; Freddie 's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood ; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.<br /><br />Oh , and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed ( again ) .
0 Oh my ... bad clothing , worse synth music and the worst : David Hasselhoff . The 80 's are back with vengeance in Witchery , an American - Italian co - production , helmed by infamous Joe ' D'Amato on the production side and short - careered director ( thank heavens for small miracles ) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi 's Evil Dead series in Italy ( that was dubbed " La Casa " in there ) , Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.<br /><br />A mix of ghost story , possessions and witchcraft , the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix - ups slow it 's progress to expectable ending , topped with some serious WTF surprise climax . ( I just love the look on her face ... ) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes ; unluckily for him , these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.<br /><br />The plus sides are experienced , when the gore hits the fan . This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80 's Italo - gore , when things were made 100 % hand - made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow . I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over - the - top ways that obnoxious characters ( and actors ) got mangled and misused , one by one . I only felt sorry for Linda Blair , who apparently have n't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career , or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.<br /><br />Well , folks - not much more to tell , and even less to tell home about . Do n't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this , and probably you 'll experience at least some mild fun . It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80 's euro gore horror . And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors , MUST have it 's one on the right place.<br /><br />This is my truth - what is yours ?
0 There are many different versions of this one floating around , so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies , otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing . Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there . The cut I saw has the on - screen title WITCHCRAFT : EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show , who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release . It 's a nice - looking print and seems to have all of the footage , but has some cropping / aspect ratio issues . In Italy , it was released as LA CASA 4 ( WITCHCRAFT ) . The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films ( retitled ) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company ( Filmirage ) , which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE . To make matters even more confusing , WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2 . Except in Germany , where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE : DEMONS 3 . OK , I better just shut up now . I 'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title , this is a very hit - or - miss horror effort . Some of it is good , some of it is n't . I actually was into this film for the first half or so , but toward the end it became a senseless mess . A large , vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting , as various people get picked off one - by - one by a German- speaking witch ( Hildegard Knef ) . Photographer Gary ( David Hasselhoff ) , who wants to capture " Witch Light , " and his virginal writer girlfriend ( Leslie Cumming ) , who is studying witchcraft , are shacking up at the hotel without permission . Along comes real estate agent Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , who 's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose ( Annie Ross ) and Freddie ( Robert Champagne ) Brooks . Also tagging along are their children ; pregnant grown daughter Jane ( Linda Blair ) and very young son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff 's wife at the time ) . Once everyone is inside , their boat driver is killed ( hung ) and the boat disappears , so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the " Lady in Black." < br /><br />So what can you expect to find here ? Plenty of unpleasantries ! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow - roasted by the rest of the cast . There 's also a crucifixion , witches eating a dead baby , a swordfish through the head , someone set on fire , a possession , a Sesame Street tape recorder , the virgin getting raped by some demon , a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff . From a technical standpoint , it 's a nice - looking film with pretty good cinematography , a decent score and good gore effects . The hotel / island setting is also pretty nice . Blair ( particularly at the end ) and Ross both seem like they 're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch . Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days , he 's not bad in his role , either.<br /><br />On the down side , despite all the gore , the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour . The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing , too . When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed , the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy . And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber . And while most of the cast is at least decent , a few of the performances ( particularly the " actress " who plays Hasselhoff 's girlfriend and the kid ) are so bad they 're constantly distracting .
0 Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4/ and whatever else you wish to call it . How about .. Crud.<br /><br />A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel , torturous methods . Photographer Gary(David Hasselhoff)is taking pictures for Linda(Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE - YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon ) , a virgin studying witchcraft , on the island resort without permission . Rose Brooks(Annie Ross , portraying an incredibly rude bitch)is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and , along with husband Freddie(Robert Champagne , who is always ogling other women much younger than him ) , pregnant daughter Jane(Linda Blair)and grandson Tommy(Michael Manchester , who just looks bored throughout , probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish ) , go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano 's son Jerry(Rick Farnsworth ) , obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet . Along with these folks is architect Leslie(Leslie Cumming , whose character is a nympho)who might help Rose re - design the resort . The boat 's captain is killed by The Lady in Black(Hildegard Knef , wearing her make - up and lip - stick extra thick)and a storm is brewing . The boat drives off by itself( .. guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black , I guess)with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort , which is in dire need of repairs . Most of the victims , before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension( .. perhaps a type of hell or something)where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage . One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney , roasted as the others light the fireplace . One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck . One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge( .. and bleed ) and neck 's blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff 's face ! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame . Blair 's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman 's voice . One is raped by this demonic man with a " diseased " mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering . The film , despite it 's excesses , is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair , who deserve better than this . Almost unbearable at times , building little - to - no suspense . Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable . Sure some gore is okay , but most of the film shows victims after they 've been run through the ringer . We do get a chance to see pregnant women( .. who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs ) jumping out three story windows . Oh , and The Lady in Black 's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see . Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black 's mumbo jumbo chants , obviously used for later . For some reason , The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy . He 's not at all scared of her , for Tommy 's just too bored to show any expression on his face , much less fear . Need I say more ? This one 's a real stinker . Ugh .
0 " Witchery " might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80 's but , luckily enough , it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects , an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices . Honestly the screenplay does n't make one iota of sense , but who cares when Linda Blair ( with an exploded hairstyle ) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer ( who ca n't seem to get laid ) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo , sewn - shut lips , upside down crucifixions , vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune . Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts . The young couple is there to investigate the place 's dark history ; the dysfunctional family ( with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are ) considers re - opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex . They 're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways . Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window . Anyway , the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin - off of " The Evil Dead " . The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make - up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film . There 's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried .
0 Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted , disgusting ways . I thought I 'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire . Hildy is quite the prankster too : she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut ... then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire ! " Witchery " made me sick . It made my eyes hurt . I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever - ever - ever made by otherwise competent people ... until the finale . I have to admit I loved the ending . It involves a boy and his toy tape - recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed . The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie 's over , but you know that old saying : " If you 've got a great ending , people will forgive you for just about anything ! "
0 A really very bad movie , with a very few good moments or qualities.<br /><br />It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair , who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks , I 'm not sure . She jumps through a window and wakes up , and we see she is very pregnant . The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.<br /><br />She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island . Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies ! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German - speaking virgin girlfriend ( you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff ... ) . He 's taking photographs , and she 's translating an esoteric German book about witches , I think.<br /><br />Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it , and a real estate agent , and a woman I thought was their daughter . Evidently she was an architect , and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple 's children . I guess they all traveled to the island together , but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them ( maybe they were filmed separately).<br /><br />The hotel seems neat , certainly from the exteriors , but it is n't used to any great effect . An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes , which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder.<br /><br />People start getting killed , either in their dreams , or sucked into hell or something . Some of these gore scenes are OK , but not enough to recommend the movie . Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover , the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut . Much of the scene is showing another character 's reaction shots , since we 're not seeing anything ourselves . The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy - looking wound of a mouth rapes someone . He looked particularly nasty . There 's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed . I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her , they would do something original with her role , and let her leave Exorcist behind her ( except for the yearly horror conventions).<br /><br />In the weird , largely Italian , tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to , this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 . That is , it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse , La ( 1988 ) - it 's not ( that 's also a better movie than this one ) . La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead ( 1981 ) and Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 ( and much better than those ) . There 's also a Casa 5 , La ( 1990 ) AKA House 5 , which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House : House ( 1986 ) House II : The Second Story ( 1987 ) , The Horror Show ( 1989 ) AKA House III , and House IV ( 1992 ) . How 's The Horror Show fit in there ? It does n't really , it claimed to be a sequel , thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less ( or more ? ) confusion . Oddly , The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House , and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2 . Does your head hurt yet ?
0 This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures . Sure , the effects are laughable , the story confused , but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun . I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in , it added to what little suspense was mustered . Give it a 3 .
0 I watched this movie purely for the setting . It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of . The plot was predictable , the acting was mediorcre at best , the scares were all gross - outs , not true scares.<br /><br />I do n't remember much of the plot , and I think that 's because there was n't much of one to remember . They did n't even use the hotel to it 's fullest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula . At low tide , you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay , which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.<br /><br />The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action ( and I 'm using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings !
0 This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff . Well , then let me bash it to . Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays , this film is n't too bad . It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming . She is super hot , but ca n't talk very well . There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped . She shows off her nice body . Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff . 3/10
0 We brought this film as a joke for a friend , and could of been our worst joke to play . The film is barely watchable , and the acting is dire . The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance . The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on . It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.<br /><br />Just terrible
0 Humm , an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair , I wasn´t expecting very much , to be honest and in fact , I took even less than I was expecting . It doesn´t mean this movie is the worst I have seen because I have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this . Apart from that you are going to love some special effects , they are really cheesy and bad . Now I only want to watch " Troll 3 " by this same director , sure it is not going to be worse than that .
0 I and a friend rented this movie . We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging . The movie 's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending . We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot .
0 I 'm gettin ' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one - line synopsis then end up being equal to what you 'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap.<br /><br />Who knows : " Witchery " may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios , even with a " big name cast " ( like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink - wink , nudge - nudge ) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef ( I dunno , some woman ... ).<br /><br />But on film , it just falls apart faster than a papier - mache sculpture in a rainstorm . Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard , and one of them ( a woman , I 'd guess ) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque , tortuous ways . < br /><br />Okay , right there you have a cross - section of plots from " The Exorcist " , " The Omen " , " Ten Little Indians " and a few other lesser movies in the satanic - worshippers - run - amok line . None of it is very entertaining and for the most part , you 'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it 's over.<br /><br />No , not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much . They 're just in it to pick up a paycheck and do n't seem very intent on giving it their " all " . < br /><br />From the looks of it , Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson ( and who can blame him ? ) and Linda ... well , who knows ; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro - am golf tour or whatever it is she 's in to nowadays.<br /><br />And the torture scenes ! Ecchhhh . You 'll see people get their mouths sewn shut , dangled up inside roaring fireplaces , strung up in trees during a violent storm , vessels bursting out of their necks , etc , etc . Sheesh , and I thought " Mark of the Devil " was the most sadistic movie I 'd seen .... <br /><br />Don't bother . It 's not worth your time . I ca n't believe I told you as much as I did . If you do watch it , just see if you can count the cliches . And yes , Blair gets possessed , as if you did n't see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band.<br /><br />No stars . " Witchery " - these witches will give you itches .
0 Making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget deficiencies is an often - used strategy in low - budget horror films , but this one takes it too far . It is SO poorly lit and murky ( and it takes place almost entirely at night , to boot ) that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen ( although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that ) . Alas , " murky " is also the best word to describe the movie 's plot . The filmmakers throw in diverse ( and unoriginal ) horror ideas without any semblance of logic , and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror film ; you know it when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger ( or , in some occasions , even dead ) making small talk .... (*1/2 )
0 I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria . So did n't have an idea what I am going to see . The story is very normal . The movie is very long , I believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story . Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! Ashton Kutcher was very good . Kevin Costner is OK . The movie is speaking about the US Coast Guards , how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face . As there are n't much effects in the movie . So if you want to watch it , then no need to waste your money and time going to the Cinema . Would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on DVDs .
0 This film has the kernel of a really good story . The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard , especially in the North Pacific , is the stuff of heroes and legends . This film mucks up a good story with three endings ( none satisfying ) , a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged " romantic " relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire . The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing . Costner is good - especially his hand acting ( watch for it ) . Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible . The main female characters are one dimensional . The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she 's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film . It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs one !
0 I 'm sure that the folks on the Texas / Louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when Paramount 's B picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public . Very simply the area along the Sabine River where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the Deep South or at least the Deep South was post Civl War . No big cattle empires there , they 're much farther west in Texas , farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire.<br /><br />The film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle , they keep the cattle . And that 's the beginning of the big Ponderosa like ranch they start.<br /><br />Along the way Foster marries Dix 's sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors . They also have some further run ins with Leo Carrillo.<br /><br />Anyway , us easterners who like westerns usually do n't bother with geographical trifles and it 's still a good western from the production mill of Harry Sherman who produced all those Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount . The climax is a blazing , and I mean that literally , gun battle that should have maybe been used on an A production.<br /><br />But I would n't have any but western fans look at it .
0 To be brutally honest ... I LOVED watching Severed . That 's why I < br /><br />gave it a 1/10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative < br /><br />story / filming / acting / everything . This film was a RIOT to watch . If < br /><br />you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them , you will < br /><br />really get a kick out of Severed.<br /><br />The story really does n't matter , it involves some guy who 's bald < br /><br />and has a sword and goes around beheading random people . < br /><br />But he has a supernatural twist ... nobody ever sees him do it . < br /><br />Even when , in one very memorable scene , he walks into a < br /><br />jampacked night club and whacks off some girl 's noodle and < br /><br />nobody sees it . < br /><br />Severed does n't merely look like it was filmed on video- it WAS < br /><br />filmed on someone 's home camcorder . The filmmakers had < br /><br />knowledge of lighting ( very thin knowledge ) and composition < br /><br />actually holds together in some scenes . But mostly you ca n't hear < br /><br />the actors ... you ca n't understand what they 're doing , and you laugh < br /><br />when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body.<br /><br />Go and rent this movie . Support films like this- they are a hoot and < br /><br />a hollar !
0 OK , I love bad horror . I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of . Demonicus , or House of the Dead - those were bad enough to make fun of . Severed was not.<br /><br />It was worse.<br /><br />(spoilers - who cares?)<br /><br />My friend and I sat through the entire film , and I have a number of comments , both in the " this sucks " style and in the realm of actual critiques.<br /><br />Plot ( sort of ) - There 's a guy in this city ( which is possibly Seattle , see comment below ) who is running around and cutting off heads . He 's been doing this for over a year ( I 'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much ) , possibly two or three years . One head a week . And the police are JUST NOW calling in a " specialist " ( who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic , but that never comes up again).<br /><br />Schya right ! Feds take over after , what , THREE connected homicides ? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we 'd be under freaking martial law!!!!!<br /><br />Anyway , this " specialist " consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time , and the two of them come to the conclusion that it 's Baron Samedi , a voodoo spirit , who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body ( and then presumably take over the world - or possibly just go to Disneyland).<br /><br />Um.<br /><br />Setting - where IS this happening ? Well , if you 're not from Seattle , you might not realize that at the bar / rave ( occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members ) , there 's a poster for a local radio station , and that in the highly - entertaining , " Pulp Fiction"esqe dialog ( as IF ) between the two cops ( yes , the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick ) they discuss " the new stadium " which may still have been an issue when this movie was made.<br /><br />Being from Seattle , I apologize on the movie 's behalf and hang my head in shame.<br /><br />OK , here 's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer ( not published , do n't go looking for my name in the IMDb ) , I do research . Lots of research . And unlike the writers of this movie , I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa ( spirit ) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated ( by various Christian oppressors ) with " Satan " - is actually a " Loki "- like trickster god . < br /><br />In other words , he does n't cut off heads.<br /><br />Besides , a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants . Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa.<br /><br />Not to mention , if he 's already possessed someone , why make a NEW body?<br /><br />Also , if Baron Samedi GOT a body , he would n't go around cutting off heads , he 'd get some good rum and cigars and par - TAY!!!<br /><br />In summary , the only thing they did get ( surprisingly ) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading ( used only to show that the voodoo chick is " spooky " ) they did n't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do . Again , I 've done research . ( Anyone remember the old late - night ad for phone - in tarot readings - " The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love ... " and all that nonsense?)<br /><br />If you made it this far through my comments , I congratulate you . And I 'm sorry again . I 'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me , so please do n't .
0 There was nothing about this movie that I liked . It was so obviously low - budget with bad lighting and camera work ( almost like Blair Witch Project , only it was n't supposed to be that way ) . There was n't really much to the plot , and the movie just drug on and on . I actually fast - forwarded through the last 1/3 of the movies , but that did not help matters much . It looked like it might be good from the box , but I must say again : nothing about this movie even resembled good . No good actors , the special effects were so fake , the camera work was horrible , and the dialogue was painfully terrible . On my own personal scale , I give this movie a 0 of 10 . Yikes !
0 Bad acting , bad lighting , bad plot ! ! This had the quality of a porno movie . I have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie ... it sucked big time ! ! Do n't waste your time or money on this crap ! It 's amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video , it should be a crime ! !
0 This is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue . Its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand . The only star in this is WCW`s Vanessa Sanchez ( Tygres in WCW before it folded ) and she is a good actress . I like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but Severed unfourtunatly isn`t one of them . This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed .
0 Hm . While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes , point out atrocious acting , primitive ( at best ) special effects ( all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years ) , Severed ranks among the worst I 've ever seen . I 'm never sure who the protagonists are , all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine , as seen in the dance floor murder scene . All in all , I do n't really like the movie , because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable , the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion ( which I ca n't remember anyway ) .
0 I own this movie . I bought it for $ 3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some " indie " " type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it . Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed . Within minutes I feel great!!!<br /><br />I hate to down talk another filmmaker so I 'll just use constructive criticism . 1 . Find good actors . Take the time . It really helps . 2 . When shooting video , over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post . 3 . Closeups are better for Video . 4 . When an actor enters a scene , wait a bit before < br /><br />having them speak so that we know what 's going on and who 's talking . 5 . Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it . Damn well worth the $ 3.99<br /><br />The True Horror would be getting the reviews Severed has here on IMDb . And you have to give these guys credit ... they did get distributed .
0 I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good - looking horror movie to watch over the New Year 's weekend . As I was looking through the shelves , " Severed " spotted my eye , and I grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent B - grade horror movie . The cover looked fairly good . The plot sounded semi - interesting . So I rented it . What a mistake . Do n't be fooled by the cover , which actually looks decent . I 'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself . The film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo - inspired , ritualistic serial killer called " The Head Hunter " , who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city ( probably Los Angeles ) , and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder.<br /><br />Story sound somewhat good ? Well , it is , and this movie could 've been halfway decent . But good God , it was bad ! Almost everything about it was laughable . The opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge , outdated cell phone , and for whatever reason , she goes outside and talks to some guy . Then , a shadow comes up behind them , hacks off his head , and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling ( for absolutely no reason ) while trying to dial 911 . Sound ridiculous ? Yep , you bet it is . The entire movie looks like it was filmed on a VHS - quality camera , and I 'm assuming it was . The acting was mostly awful , and the special effects were far from believable . And the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful - the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone 's bathroom . Everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious , and it did n't hold my interest for very long , and I often found myself bored and tired , mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography . The pacing was bad . Everything was just bad.<br /><br />Overall , " Severed " is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent B - movie . The plot was good and I think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget , it could 've been alright . But this movie fell flat on it 's face . If you 're expecting something semi - decent , you 'll be sorely disappointed . Only recommended if you can tolerate D - grade horror flicks . Otherwise , you 'll probably want to stay away from this straight - to - video garbage . It had a little potential , but it was beyond a mess . 1/10 .
0 0.5/10 . This movie has absolutely nothing good about it . The acting is among the worst I have ever seen , what is really amazing is that EVERYONE is awful , not just a few here and there , everyone . The direction is a joke , the low budget is hopelessly evident , the score is awful , I would n't say the movie was edited , brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase . It combines serial killings , voodoo and tarot cards . Dumb . Dumb . Dumb . It is not scary at all , the special effects are hopelessly lame . laughably bad throughout . The writing was appallingly bad . The cinematography is real cheap looking , and very grainy sometimes , and the camera - work is dreadful . Again , what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are . Cheesy .
0 This film was a big disappointment.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics . This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors ; here the actors ( Bette Davis and James Cagney ) are simply not up to the level of the material . Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney , and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all - time classic . With a very similar story , Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy ( good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted ! ) Davis ' one - note performance oozes petulance , but none of the nuances of Colbert 's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney , who was a great comedy actor , just seems out - of - sync with his costar , Davis . The script provides some decent lines and gags , but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the soundtrack , which , like the delivery of Davis and Cagney , seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson , who played similar roles throughout his career , has more capably handled very similar material . In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance . In a slightly different role as an old west relic , Harry Davenport , is very good . But in one of his poorest performances , William Frawley is quite irritating . His character 's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony . < br /><br />I really love every one of these performers , and it is a shame that , as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
0 Rich ditzy Joan Winfield ( a woefully miscast Bette Davis ) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical Allen Brice ( Jack Carson looking lost ) . Her father ( Eugene Palette ) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins ( James Cagney . Seriously ) . They crash land in the desert and hate each other but ( sigh ) start falling in love.<br /><br />This seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are in it . They were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why ! The script is just horrible -- there 's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie . The running joke in this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first in a cactus ( this is done THREE TIMES ! ) . Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated . As it is they both do their best with the lousy material . Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full force but it does n't work . Carson has this " what the hell " look on his face throughout the entire movie ( probably because his characters emotions change in seconds ) . Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles . But , all in all , this was dull and laughless -- a real chore to sit through . This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis ' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really -- it 's not worth seeing . Cagney and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why .
0 Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the " hilariously mismatched " lovers theme . Sadly , Cagney and Davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful . The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who , literally , phones in his usual part as the deb 's misunderstood dad . Jack Carson 's performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience
0 Woosh  ! Man   What can I say ... ?<br /><br />The opening - scene , maybe ? We see a bunch of mongoloid - barbarians with bad make - up jump off the walls of some ruins . They sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl . The dude runs off , the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl , but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her . Then , the dude ( still on the run ) sees a horse and tries to steal it . Suddenly   a blond god - like looking hero with a bad wig appears , saying " That 's my horse ! " . The Mighty Deathstalker just made his appearance . The mongoloids arrive , Deathstalker kills all of them ( including the dude ) on the tunes of some rather inappropriate Mexicanos western score ( this is supposed to be a Swords & Sorcery flick , so what 's with the ' arriba - trompettos ' ? ) , and then goes up to Captive Girl and exposes both her breasts . He starts to rub them and Captive Girl seems to like it . She starts liking her lips and caressing Deathstalker . Just when they are about to get down to it , this old dude appears , interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for Deathstalker ( and a possible perfect ending for a short - film).<br /><br />Now tell me   Is n't that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie , or any other male viewer would say " This is going to be one hell of a good movie ! " The plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony : Deathstalker must obtain the Sword of Justice and use it to steal the Amulet of Life and the Chalice of Magic from the evil sorcerer Munkar.<br /><br />Aside from decapitations , dismemberment , random bloodshed , retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights , this film also contains a massive amount of t!ts & a$$ shots . I initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies I could count . After 9 points ( not even halfway into the movie ) , I had to give up counting . It was distracting me from the rest of the movie . And the rest of the movie was worth it . Totally crazy stuff . Check out this mutant cat / worm - like creature Munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers . And here 's an interesting question : What would you do if a man in a woman 's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife ? The answer is simple : You slap him around a bit , take away the knife and then try to rape him . Then you discover that he 's actually not a woman , so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room . It works out well , I tell you . Deathstalker does it too , and the Deathstalker - way , is the right way!<br /><br />DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie , really , as pointed out in other comments . The villains are vile . The women are delicious . There 's blood , sex , violence , rape and tasty chicken . There 's a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating , slashing and hacking the crap out of each other . My favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer , used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp . And my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the Warthog - head ( reminiscent of the Gamorrean Guards from RETURN OF THE JEDI ) . I wo n't reveal how the movie ends , but just prepare to ravish in delight when I tell you a 4-way dismemberment is thrown into the movie 's climax.<br /><br />And of course , there 's a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie . See a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road , and the next point - of - view shot shows him being dragged over grass ( no road ) . See that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer 's head magically change sides within the same scene ( on shot has it on the left side of his head , the other on the right ) . Well , after all , Munkar is a magician . It 's that , or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like " continuity " simply do n't exist.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed this and as much as I am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series , I do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass . I am prepared , though , to give it the maximum amount of minimal points , just so I could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow . DEATHSTALKER might be a superbly fun , trashy & sleazy CONAN rip - off , it also is an abominable movie .
0 This film 's kind of like Conan the Barabarian , but with more sex , rape and murder . There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers do n't do a good job showing it , which is a shame because it ' could ' be a decent story . Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role , as does the villain - who sadly did n't appear in anything else of note . The fight scenes are n't too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword ' drink ' the blood of his victims - and there 's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout . < br /><br />All in all , not good - but not necessarily that bad either ...
0 Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and it stars Rick Hill , who is some kind of body builder and famous of that , if I have understood right ? The plot follows as Deathstalker ( Hill ) tries to get something back from the evil lord , and he has to travel to the lord 's cave . He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey , and the settings are very close to Tolkien , and of course Conan the Barbarian . This is a rip off of huge success of Conan , and even though this is very stupid film , it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies!<br /><br />There are no many cinematic merits in this film . Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating , but what Deathstalker concentrates to show , are nude females and huge muscles of Hill . Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid , too , so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists ! The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull , and the monsters are not either anything special . And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done , but what did you expect from low budget effort like this ? This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably . As I said , this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else . This belongs to the category it 's so bad it 's great!<br /><br />Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be , and as a turkey film , I appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys , enjoyable ones of course ! If bad films are your cup of tea , then try this and have fun , but if you do n't understand " enjoyably bad films " then stay away . And if somebody ca n't stand large amount of nudity , then stay away as well . There is more nudity here than violence , and due to these scenes , the film has an R rating . Otherwise this could be some safe PG family film!<br /><br />4/10
0 This sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous " hero " vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail . The acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles . The leering , gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting ; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause , since he is as bad as the people he 's fighting . Z - movie editing is abundant , including a scene where a character " dies " from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely!<br /><br />The movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads , Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson , who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie . As a 20-something male , I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen does n't attract me . But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless , that I could n't enjoy even this aspect of the movie.<br /><br />Most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light - hearted , tongue - in - cheek feel ( the sequel is better in this regard ) , but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy . No way ! Avoid at all costs!<br /><br />Rating : 1/2 out of * * * * .
0 ... Or , more precisely , so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it ! James Sbardellati 's " Deathstalker " of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the Sword & Sorcery sub - genre has brought along , but it is highly amusing . The acting is terrible , the plot is pure crap , and the effects and photography could n't be more amateurish . But it is the bad acting , the cheesy effects , and the many errors , that makes this movie so hilarious.<br /><br />- SPOILERS AHEAD -<br /><br />Deathstalker ( Rick Hill ) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior . One day , a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation , a sword , an amulet and a chalice , in order to free the country from its brutal ruler , the evil king and sorcerer Munkar . Obtaining the sword is quite easy , but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkar 's possession . Fortunately , the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county 's most skilled warriors fight each other until death . The winner is then to take the king 's place . Of course , the king does n't want anybody to take his place , an therefore he has planned to kill the winner ( instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place ) . Deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation , but also to save the old , good king 's gorgeous daughter ( Barbi Benton ) from the claws of evil Munkar . Luckily , he does n't get bored on his way to the tournament , since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior Kaira ( Lana Clarkson ) in the meantime ... <br /><br />The film has many great , incredibly stupid and funny scenes . Some of my favorite scenes include : < br /><br />- Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword . The head that falls down , however , is not that guy 's head . The falling head has a red goatee , while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard.<br /><br />- When the character of female warrior Kaira ( Lana Clarkson ) is introduced , she is first seen in a black robe , hiding her face and body . Deathstalker 's traveling companion Oghris ( Richard Brooker ) fights her , and during the sword fight her robe ( under which she is , of course topless ) opens , exposing her breasts . Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson , even before her face.<br /><br />- The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament , is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig.<br /><br />- Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest . He feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers.<br /><br / > ... There are many other unintentionally funny , hilarious , and great scenes . The acting is terrible but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eye - candy , and although I described this movie as ' unintentionally funny ' , I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is . There is a fair amount of gore , and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained . " Deathstalker " is an incredibly awful movie , but I still highly recommend it . People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives !
0 DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B - fantasy movie fans ; this barely 80-minute travesty of film - making features everything hecklers can ask for -- non - existent plotting , terrible acting ( save for at least a raspy - sounding old lady ) , laughable scripting and schlock editing , and bargain - basement style background settings . There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting ( in particular , the lead does n't have ANYTHING appealing about him ) , and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F - grade material . If that 's not enough , then how about the lack of a compelling plot ( which this movie has nothing of the sort ) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey ? I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 ) be topless and/or scantily clad ; 2 ) get raped ; 3 ) have sex with the hero ; 4 ) all of the above . In addition , the background music is hideous ; a bizarre mess of electronic noise , cheesy choral bursts , and blaring orchestral cacophony . Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested , DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at ( and believe me , there 's plenty of that in here ) . Otherwise , I do not recommend this 100th - grade CONAN wanna - be to anyone in the least .
0 I had to give this film a 1 because it 's that bad , but do n't make this think that I did n't enjoy watching , because I laughed and laughed , and I even had a few questions . So half of the time I was laughing , half of the time I was saying " what in the hell is going on ? " or " why would someone do this ? " et cetera . I mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects , the 80 's style nude scene / battle / dialogue / nude scene , and the way that the warrior 's swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses . And there 's some crappy model effects ( those are n't supposed to be real trees , are they ? ) and I still do n't understand this guy that they find in the cave , what in the hell is he ? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I would give em a try , and I basically liked the film as people like Ed Wood films , I have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be , I look at it in my own hilarious way . So do n't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie , it is , I just liked it for other reasons . It 's much , much worse than Evil Dead , so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it ( which came into my mind a few times ) . I guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks , have some friends around , and laugh at this film . Maybe this is a bit harsh , but I do n't think so , rent it and you 'll see . Yo .
0 This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers , eating pizza , and laugh at . Unfortunately for me I found myself watching this one alone . My friends and I rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one . It was due back and I figured that it was a waste not to watch it . So I did , and I was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is.<br /><br />Now , I love bad movies quite a bit , and I probably would have liked this one if the " hero " was n't so utterly loathsome . The entire movie I was hoping that he 'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him ! He does very little heroic things in the movie . He 's a beefy , disgusting , stupid thing . He has less redeeming qualities than the villains do . And what was it with all the naked chicks ? I mean , I love naked chicks just as much as the next guy , but this movie went a tad overboard in that department.<br /><br />Well , anyway , if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting " hero " then I 'm sure you 'll like this schlock of a film .
0 Wha - BAM ! Someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acid - mushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture ! Writer Howard Cohen expands the " Sword & Sorcery " concept with a couple of extra S 's , like Sex , Silliness , ( more ) Sex and Sheer Stupidity ! This is n't just a movie , this is every juvenile pervert 's dreams & fantasies come true ! " Deathstalker " has it all : blood , violence , trolls , female mud - wrestling , attempted rape , successful rape , life - sized pigs ( ! ) , awful hairstyles , hideously oiled muscular bodies , multi - sexual orgies , gay warriors , tournaments - to - the - death , delirious witches , dismemberment , laughable villains and boobs , boobs , BOOOOOOOOOBIES ! ! " Deathstalker " literally wipes the floor with its obvious role - model " Conan : The Barbarian " when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance . The story is , evidently , of minor importance . Lone and gay ( only he does n't know it yet ) warrior Deathstalker goes on a mission , as commanded by an annoying witch , to gather the three notorious elements of creation   or something like that . On his journey he combines forces with a troll - turned - human , a fighter who 's even gayer than he is and - last but not least - a luscious lady who does n't really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras . Together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil Munkar where they 'll participate in a warriors ' tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements . Munkar is bald guy with half a spider 's web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous . Okay , granted , " Deathstalker " is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie . The fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make - up effects are downright pitiable . For a moment , when beholding the opening sequence , I actually feared I was watching " Troll ; the Prequel " . The monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing , but it 's undeniable entertainment if you 're in an undemanding mood . I presume this is n't a favorite amongst feminists , as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat  um  discriminating . Most of the gals exclusively serve as eye - candy in the harem . They 're allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud , but strictly forbidden to open their mouths . The two " leading " ladies ( Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson ) are ravishing but - in all honesty - if it would n't be for their continuously exposed racks , they would hardly be worth mentioning , either .
0 I do n't recall walking out of a movie theater except this once . Not only that , but I was with 7 friends , and we all wanted to go . An uninteresting plot , characters made of clay , violence with no point . I did n't care when the good guys died ; I did n't care when the bad guys got it . The fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency . In short , fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in Hell .
0 I saw the MST3 K version of " Deathstalker III " and loved the movie so much -- even " unmystied " -- that I decided to watch the entire series of " Deathstalker " films . I bought I and II and settled down for a laugh.<br /><br />Nothing about " Deathstalker I " was funny on any level and when the credits rolled I was embarrassed and regretful that I had bought it ! Too much ugliness and nudity . I guess either " DS 3 " was a much cleaner production or MST3 K really edited a lot because I expected something similar , i.e. stupid and carefree and simple . I was wrong . Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money . I did n't even open " DS 2 " as I will return it tomorrow . Now I 'll probably just throw away this DVD as I ca n't return it and no one wants it -- including myself ! So really , do n't bother with this one . Even the nudity ( lots of it , btw ) is uninspiring and icky .
0 This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen , everything about it is weak and incoherent . The acting is absurd , the costumes even crummier and the story is non - existent . This ' poverty row ' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that " Beastmaster " and " Conan " enjoyed but it does n't give us any reason to follow along . The lead character is tepid and dull , he ca n't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th Century . All the action sequences are like that , slow and unrealistic , not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse . Do n't even bother with this crap .
0 Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon . Throw in a couple of cute animals , some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you 'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film.<br /><br />I remember seeing this when I was younger ; I made my Mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times . The story itself is n't too bad , it 's just that any Marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about.<br /><br />If you do n't like America you wo n't like this film .
0 Living in the Middle East ( in Israel ) , I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana . Having seen the trailer , and being a thriller - lover , I expected to see first of all a fast moving , breath catching movie , which wisely dips in global policy - making and the relation between oil , power and corruption , from a fresh angle . Well , I almost left the movie in the middle . The pace was painfully slow , almost all characters were stereotyped , the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult , but , as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review , in the end you do n't care . Save your money , save your time , choose another movie.<br /><br />Robi Chernitsky
0 Syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it . I suppose it 's one of those films that is intensely intelligent ... so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind . I do n't consider myself unintelligent , I 've been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it 's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message . Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away . I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it 's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better . This film was the most confusing , senseless , mindless dribble I have seen in awhile ... Especially considering the critical acclaim , the Oscar nods , and the cast . Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again . His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he 's just trying way too hard . I ca n't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay . On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess . I had no idea who anyone was , why things were happening , who was who and what was what . It was a disaster.<br /><br />Because I do n't really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright . George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think ? ? Bob Barnes . Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he 's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part . Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character . Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it . Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given . Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something . I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he does n't get top billing anymore.<br /><br />The cast is intense if only the story made sense . I 'd like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb . " A missile disappears in Iran , but the CIA has other problems : the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China , cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract . The Department of Justice suspects bribery , and the oil company 's law firm finds a scapegoat . The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emir - apparent fails . Agent Bob Barnes , the fall guy , sorts out the double cross . An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead . The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group . All roads start and end in the oil fields . " WHAT ! ? ! ? Say who now ? ? Syriana might be the thinking man 's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you could n't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it . I suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but I promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour . 1/10
0 Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show . This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD . Syriana was one in which I did give up . Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust.<br /><br />This movie is disjointed , boring , confusing and lackluster . The acting was dry and without credible portrayals . The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest . The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot . Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop . I can not imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award .
0 Simply put : the movie is boring . Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together . It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary . The main plot is very thin ( a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince , gets caught and then warns the prince ( why ? ) ) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting . So , a kid dies , which results in the " natural " response of the father : freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death . The lawyer has a drunk " friend " and keeps him around , why , no one knows . Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.<br /><br />All in all , this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while . I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged . I neither laughed nor cried , I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause . It meant nothing to me , which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie .
0 This movie was slower then Molasses in January ... in Alaska . The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview . I had to wake up the people I was watching it with , several times . After it was over , I felt bad for having woken them up . < br /><br />Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen , but nothing ever does . It was easy to loose track of people 's motives , and the characters were flat and uninteristing . By the end of the movie , you just hoped everyone would died . Everyone runs around either being contemptible , petty , or pitiful , and usually all three . < br /><br />And worse , we watched a minute or two of the added features , just for kicks and giggles you understand , and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are . If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back , it might have been worth watching . < br /><br />I was brought in expecting the excitement of ' 24 . ' I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman .
0 I could n't wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the film . What a disappointment ! This became one of the most confusing films I 've ever viewed . There were so many characters introduced , some resembling others , that it became impossible to follow the story line . I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved , at least in the first half of the movie . My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD . I might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim . A co - worker told me that a lot of the movie " comes together " in the last minute or less . I was glad I did n't waste another hour , waiting . I gave the DVD away the following day .
0 Exceedingly complicated and drab . I 'm a bright guy , but this was just too much for a tired brain . It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing . Probably better for the US market . GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why.<br /><br />Still the sand dunes are pretty . The nail pulling is nasty . The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery . The cricket is good to see.<br /><br />Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this , despite it being over 2 hours long . Thank heavens they shortened it . Admittedly we do n't get to the pictures much , but the last film we saw , Walk the Line , was 10 times better and I do n't really like Johnny Cash . My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there 's that ..... am I nearly there yet ? < br /><br />How about now
0 This movie , supposedly a thriller , had about five sub - plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end , but it ended up more as a yawn.<br /><br />The writing was trite , the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring . George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym , Matt Damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter.<br /><br />The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business , oil and the Middle - East . I have seen documentaries provide more excitement . Watch it only if there 's absolutely nothing else to do .
0 OK Hollywood is not liberal.<br /><br />Obviously I 'm lieing because it is . I m a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie . This movie was anti bush , anti middle east , anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad.<br /><br />Fist off i will give credit where credit is due . i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage . The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good.<br /><br />The plot was impossible for me to decode however . I have been tested and have an IQ of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what.<br /><br />The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized.<br /><br />Unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story , which it very well may be , i have no idea exactly what was going on.<br /><br />Which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique ! If you ca nt dazzle them with brilliance , then baffle them with Bull S.
0 I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources . I would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film.<br /><br />I am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film , the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles.<br /><br />For the political buff 's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good , but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward , very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee.<br /><br />see it if your ready to focus 100 % on every minute detail or politics interest you . do n't see it , if you actually like watching films .
0 Contrary to most other comments about " Syriana " on the IMDb web - site , I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space.<br /><br />In short , this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far . Rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner , it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story - lines from a dozen or so " story - lines " at the audience made for great and clear viewing . No , sir , it does not . What does make for great viewing is total clarity , precision , plots and story - lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning , a middle , and an end.<br /><br />This kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.<br /><br />Thank goodness , then , for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers , director , and actors knew the value of clear story telling , diction , and acting that meant something.<br /><br />This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again .
0 We gave up at the point where George Clooney 's character has his finger - nails extracted . We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like . To say this film was incomprehensible , boring , pretentious twaddle would be to over - praise it ! How did people manage to sit through this confusing , slow , depressing pseud 's corner of a film , let alone nominate it for an Oscar ? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him . What was he thinking ? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles ? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid - air ? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well . I pity the cast , who obviously did their best with the material available .
0 Considering how much money was budgeted for this film , you would expect more from the story as a whole . This could be quite possibly the most worthless movie I have ever watched . There was no real advancement of anything . Character development , minimal . Plot advancement , maybe . Enjoyment , none . I 'm not sure what points were even trying to be made . If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys , American CIA bombs everything that does n't agree with our opinions , all capitalists are corrupt , and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death , have at . For those of us who realize that it does n't take killing off a good guy to make a point , we 'll stick to other movies . In summary , this was a horrible attempt at an ' Ocean 's 11 ' style hide - the - plot - so - person - has - to- think movie because not only do you not know what 's going on , nobody who made the movie did either . Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece .
0 This film 's premise is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot . In summary : the oil business is in cahoots with The Government ( or Gummint if you prefer ) , the Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots , and the CIA is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons - of-(insert word ) willing to toe any line that comes their way . The only people that get done over are the good ones , like Mr Clooney ( " Bob " ) . Oh , and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . That really fits to the profiles of the well - heeled 9/11 perpetrators.<br /><br />In Syriana this facile tissue of political half - truths and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist , turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that : < br /><br />1 . the " director " ( good joke ) should never be let near a camera again < br /><br />2 . people like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act , but they sure do n't know how to pick a script < br /><br />3 . if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state , go and see Claude Chabrol 's " L'ivresse du pouvoir " , which is insightful , funny and brilliantly acted . < br /><br />Empty , doom - laden sententious piffle spun out to evening - ruining length .
0 It seems that Salvatores could n't decide what to do with this movie : some of it is a very weak thriller ( and I say very , very weak ) , some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters . Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers , but in this case the movie can not hold things together , due to poor , superficial scripting , bad acting and a too dark , too dull cinematography . I 'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings , where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot . On the whole , a B - movie , hardly worth your money ... Vote : 4/10
0 Apparently Shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is . At one point in this film , someone ( I believe Pacino 's producer ) warns him that film is getting off track , that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III . Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout . Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al ( was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeare 's birthplace , other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there ? ) , and , before the film has really even begun , we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera . I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT - but apparently it 's how Al really behaves in person.<br /><br />Enough rambling . Here 's a shotgun smattering of why I did n't even make it 3/4 of the way through this : 1 ) pretentious - Al always knows when the camera is on him , whether he 's acting as Richard or in a ' real ' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes , also , some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme . If anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside , it 's unbearable . " Look at me , chewing all the scenery ! " 2 ) Winona Ryder . When she appears as Lady Anne , this film comes to a screeching halt , which it never recovers from . She has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes . Her performance is dreadful , to boot . 3 ) the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture . Of course , you also learn that Pacino should n't be directing films ( or doing Richard in the first place ) . I 'd rather watch BOBBY DEERFIELD than this.<br /><br />Lastly , read the play and learn it for yourself . Go out and see it performed . In 1997 I saw the play performed at the University of Washington Ethnic Cultural Theater , and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama ( except for the gratuitous throat slashing of Clarence ! My God ! Was that necessary?!)<br /><br />It 's all just a bunch of sound and fury , signifying nada .
0 I remember watching this on prime time when I was about 7 years old . I was a huge comic book reader at the time , and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily . The end result , however , was underwhelming.<br /><br />I was aware of the " Emma Peel " Diana Prince stories , as they had only recently come to an end and Diana was returned to her Amazonian form . However , there was so little action that I was bored throughout most of the movie . The final costume was an interesting idea , but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero.<br /><br />I saw the movie again in my late teen years . It had n't improved much . Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar , thanks to That 's Incredible , but her acting was no better . The script had a few good ideas , like the rogue Amazon , and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban , but it just did n't come together and was still boring.<br /><br />I think they should have built the back story better , and built the show into a more epic climax . It was too much like a bland spy film , crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book . The Amazon elements were intriguing , but needed to be expanded.<br /><br />The film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful , if a bit too camp and low budget . The budget was also pretty low here , and superheroes do n't come cheap.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD , if only as a comparison and historical document . Even Superman 4 is available , and it has nothing over this film ( except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman ) . It 's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions .
0 I 've been reading posts here concerning Wonder Woman 's costume for this TV movie . It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made , she was n't wearing her traditional outfit . The producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer 's conception of WW for the early seventies.<br /><br />As for the movie itself , I have to agree with many of the other posters here . Snoozefest ! I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974 , so I was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero . Yet I was so " engrossed " with the plot , I stopped watching it three quarters into the movie.<br /><br />Of course , I was n't at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee ! :-)
0 I had always been a big Lynda Carter - Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci - Fi Channel ran this movie , I had to see it . I was bitterly disappointed . This is a Wonder Woman movie in name only . She does n't wear the right costume [ she must have refused to or had ordered major changes ] and the plot runs like a poor man 's James Bond . There 's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will . It 's just one long bad dream . I do n't even think Cathy is all that attractive anyway . I would n't waste your time on this .
0 This movie is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it . What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers , producers and director ? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination ? The plot is laughable , the acting is poor at best , the story ... What story ? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.<br /><br />I guess I 'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.<br /><br / > * * * SPOLER ALERT * * * < br /><br />I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he is in it ... for 30 seconds ... <br /><br />I give it 1 out of 10 because it 's the lowest grade IMDb has to offer.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour : See an Uwe Boll movie instead ... twice ... it 's more worthy of your time .
0 This movie is hilarious , not in good way . The fights are awfully bad done , while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones , and even this happens only two or three times , definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie . A gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi 's , pick up a gun , start shooting back and not get hurt . < br /><br />The story empty , guy waking up , lost his memory , starts fighting cos that 's what he 's good at . Five years later memories come back , takes revenge blablabla . < br /><br />Not worth your buck , not really worth your time unless you 're drunk and bored .
0 Ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours . When nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point I should have left . But , ever hopeful , I stayed . And left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time . Acting was OK , but the story line is so transparent and weak . The script is about as lame as it could get , but again , stretching out the ten minute plot does n't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue .
0 Sondra Locke stinks in this film , but then she was an awful ' actress ' anyway . Unfortunately , she drags everyone else ( including then = real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her . But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one ? One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer . It 's an exceptionally weak story , basically no story or plot at all . Add in bored , poor acting , even from the normally good Eastwood . There 's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned , this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers . Wow ! Could a film BE any more boring ? I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun . A real stinker . Do n't bother with this one .
0 Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy , the leader of a Wild West troupe , one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling - to - break - even touring show . The seventh member of the bunch is a woman , Billy 's assistant , but such women never last long , and the position is chronically open . Enter Antoinette Lilly ( Sandra Locke  Eastwood 's girlfriend at the time ) . It seems Miss Lilly , as Doc ( Scatman Crothers ) calls her , is a would - be heiress who will only receive her long - deceased father 's estate if she 's married by the time she turns 30 , so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish Geoffrey Lewis.<br /><br />So , what 's the plot of this film ? It 's hard to say . There 's the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly , but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she 's so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes ' one of the troupe ' halfway through the film , it 's not only unbelievable , but the audience is well past caring about her . There 's the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show , but this topic is n't touched upon enough to really be the raison d'etre of the film . There 's Miss Lilly 's predicament of being stranded in the rural west , cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury ( she 's mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press ) . But are we really supposed to believe that she could n't get back to New York and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort?<br /><br />No , the point of this film seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family , a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin . This is a warm , fuzzy film  or at least tries to be . < br /><br />Along the way , Clint shows us his skills with a gun , even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non - violent film . One of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge ; Billy bribes the local sheriff . The show 's tent burns down ; an orphanage makes them a new one . But numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make.<br /><br />Compounding the problem is the acting , or lack thereof . Aside from Scatman Crothers , the supporting cast is quite amateurish . Eastwood is n't on top of his game either , though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch.<br /><br />And for all this , the film plods on for 116 minutes . To what point ? Good question   < br /><br />4 out of 10

0 I appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film , but this is too much . In the end they look like a bunch of loonies . This film is one of those finding yourself 70 's plots , I know the film is made in 1980 . A lot more of Clint and girl friend movie . This movie is a 3/10 .
0 This was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970 's , usually on the " 4 am Movie " or one time , on the 7:30 PM " Channel 6 Big Movie " and still another on Creature Double Feature . WHen local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time ) It was of the time . A couple of low - rent Abbott and Costello wannabees(Frankie Ray and Robert Ball ) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in Army Surplus remainders ) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation , and wind up encountering extraterrestrials . They first go into Bronson Canyon to what would be later the famous Batcave on BATMAN , and encounter the remains of a dead " carrot monster " . Later , in the cave they 're chased by a living carrot creature - basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head , with sparkly things on it and ping - pong ball eyes . Two of them - complete geeks , Ray and Ball - are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being " examined " by space amazons - Dr Poona(nooo kidding ! ) and Professor Tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini " uniforms " . We were too young at the time , to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this " examination " scene would more than suggest . Turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster , are stranded on earth with a ship that 's well hidden and are trying to return to their world.<br /><br />The film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when Eric Von Zipper and his crew from Frankie and Annette 's films , were the height of B - film , drive - in comedy . So it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks.<br /><br />For some reason I only thought I 'd imagined seeing this film to start with . No , I really saw it . And when it was released on " restored " DVD I was assured in my memory . The comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid , but whatever . The budget is non - existent , which , is a minor miracle when you think about it , that it even got made and we can talk about a " restored " version here and now - over 40 years later . The payoff is the girls who want to learn about " love " and " kissing " and , the upshot is the geeks - which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out . It 's just goofy and silly and for the locations , has nostalgic significance .
0 Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes.<br /><br />I love 50 sci fi , I even love cheesy 50s sci fi , but this film is really , really bad . And not in a MST3 K kinda way.<br /><br />Virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best " hip cat " impression of Abott & Costello.<br /><br />Chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi , such as in " Cat Women On The Moon " but it ca n't in this case . This film requires a mute button and fast forward feature.<br /><br />That said , I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so .
0 - Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci - fi films of the 50s . I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously . The problem I have is that none of it works . A parody should be funny and this one just is n't . Not once during the entire runtime did I so much as crack a smile . In general , I am easily entertained , but I could n't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures.<br /><br />- I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning . The two " stars " make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they ca n't control that gets them both wet . These two come off as Bowery Boys wannabes . Why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me . After the less than illustrious beginning , the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences , dancing Indians , vegetable men , decoder rings , and other assorted unfunny bits . It 's all just a complete waste of time.<br /><br />- I bought this on the double feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls . That movie is Academy Award winning stuff in comparison with Invasion of the Star Creatures .
0 Invasion of the Star Creatures would definitely be in the " so bad it 's good " category if the film was n't quite so sexist or racist . That it is such just makes it plain bad.<br /><br />It has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in Queen of Outer Space , and the kind of racist stereotypes ( in this instance , Native Americans ) that you would normally find in thirties & forties b - westerns . In terms of being non - funny , the same walking - through - the - cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie . Ray does do one good impression of Jimmy Cagney ( but ca n't make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row , nor handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it ) . There really are n't any production values to speak of , as the " Star Creatures " make the Ro - Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like creations of Industrial Light and Magic.<br /><br />This film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema ... not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all - night drive - in.<br /><br / >
0 Some things need to be clarified . The picture of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris who starred in this movie . I know that because he was my dad . Please remove that picture . Also , Mark Ferris was the writer , at least one of them . I have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again . It has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy , that would be great . The movie was n't all that bad , and trying to compare it to todays world of Star Wars and other high tech sci fi 's it futile . If you watch it , just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses . Lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films .
0 This is the worst brain damaged , ultra cheap , super stupid , silly , pointless piece of trash I 've ever seen , an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre . If you think that Ed Wood 's " Plan 9 " is bad , well ... let me tell you , looks like " Citizen Kane " compared to that one . ¿ Special effects? ... again , " Plan 9 " is " Star Wars " . ¿ Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it 's beyond bad , really . But if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies , it 's for you ! I 'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies , the Price - Corman - Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff , but with " Star Creatures " they descend right down to the Z level . Of course , my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun ( the guy playing an Indian chief is great ) so have fun and enjoy ... if you can .
0 The first " Home Alone " was one of the funniest movies of the 90 's . The second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes ! Now comes " Home Alone 3 " . I was curious how they could continue with the same story considering Kevin would 've been 17 by 1997 . He could take care of himself , right ? So , what does the director decide to do ? He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick . The kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house ? What kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots ? I do n't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie . But please , I 'd recommend that you 'd stay away from it . It 's not worth your precious time . Go fold a piece of paper , do chores , balance a pencil on your nose , or take a nap ! It 's better to do then to watch " Home Alone 3"!<br /><br />1/10
0 Beating the bad guys ... Again is the tag line for this movie , it exposes so much truth about it.<br /><br />Home Alone one and two , film classics . Home Alone three and four , a good film if you 're three ! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl , as hard as it tries to be funny , it 's not . Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else . He 's a very bland actor with bland performances , but it 's not entirely his fault , the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions . The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks , and you 'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real . A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day . And to make things worst , a totally different cast , go see if you do n't believe me , but you 'll regret it .
0 ' Home Alone 3 ' is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains . However , the plot is very similar to the original ' Home Alone ' film . Instead of two comical villains , we get three or four of them . This film involves some traps , but it also has a long scene with a remote - control car . The slapstick humour is consistent as well , but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film . ( No pun intended . ) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did , and there really is not the warm , holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had . It 's more of a pure comedy , but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me . I would not recommend this film ; it 's pretty boring . If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy , then watch the original ' Home Alone ' movie .
0 The first Home Alone was a decent enough film ... the sequel was pretty much the same , at a new setting . This one tries to be original , and succeeds to some degree ... of course , the formula is basically the same , so it 's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot . The new score is quite bad(though the new " setting traps " piece was , if nothing else , interesting and different ) , especially compared to the grand score of the first , and the almost - but - not - quite - as - good score of the second . It ( almost ) makes up for it by using some pretty good non - original music , but it 's just not the same . The plot is fair , and somewhat original to the franchise , but it 's still basically the same movie as the first two , with worse acting and a less impressive example of the ' scary character turning out to be good ' . The acting is mostly unimpressive . The characters are mostly caricatures . The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy - stuff , which is almost criminal , given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are , and how precious few of them are cool ) . The fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps ) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films ... and it does n't work . The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too ... adult and serious for a children 's film(and there was a sexual joke or two , though that is n't the first time in the series ) . It 's also unnecessarily complex , as is the plot in general . I could follow it , but I doubt a kid could . Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid . The animal stuff is generally not amusing . There are fewer siblings , which should mean that those there are get developed more , but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films . All in all , just not particularly good , or worth watching , unless you * really * love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon - y violence . I recommend this to huge fans of the series only . 3/10
0 Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the Home Alone empire . Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car . Because of baggage confusion , grouchy Mrs. Hess ( Marian Seldes ) gets the car . She gives it to her neighbor , Alex ( Linz ) , just before the spies turn up . The spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car . Home alone with the chicken pox , Alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress , but the spies always manage to elude the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls . The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex , unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby - trap his entire house . Home Alone 3 was n't horrible , but probably should n't have been made , you ca n't just replace Macauley Culkin , Joe Pesci , or Daniel Stern . Home Alone 3 had some funny parts , but I do n't like when characters are changed in a movie series , view at own risk .
0 In 1987 , John Hughes wrote and directed ' Planes , Trains and Automobiles ' , which was a hilarious and poignant comedy  the best thing he 's ever done . Ten years on he 's reduced to again recycling the plot of ' Home Alone ' in this second sequel , which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic . The four crooks  that 's right , four ! And one of them is a girl ! Congratulations , Hughes , for introducing this revolutionary change to the series !  are electrocuted with metal chairs , brained with barbells and blinded with paint , ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha , while the new kid is even less charming than Culkin . You 'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilising the same old routines , but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for ' Home Alone 4 ' .
0 I like to keep my reviews short and simple , but this pretty much sums it up . You can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of Chris Columbous.<br /><br />This movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting . I ca nt even believe these people are considered actors.<br /><br />Painful to sit through and watch . The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back . Horrible , rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself ! < br /><br />The movie was n't even set during Christmas like the original . Home Alone was turned from an excellent Christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot !
0 This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies that I have EVER seen ! Watch part 1 and two , but do n't let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two ! I mean , really , you do n't make a movie , then make a sequel with the same characters and actors , and then make another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors ! I mean , it would have been OK if this wan't a " Home Alone " movie , but they DID make it a Home Alone movie . Culkin is too old now , so you 're suppose to STOP making sequels ! Goodness , this movie makes me SICK ! Buy part 1 and 2 .
0 I would like to say that curiosity got the best of me . If only I saw a trailer , I 'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie ; I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life , and about twenty dollars . This movie was a disaster waiting to happen , and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.<br /><br />The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality . For example , this kid 's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood , and even enters this house . It 's even covered with clothes . Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances ? Hollywood obviously did not believe so . Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite ; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street , let alone a house across the street . Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess . Why is it in all these movies , these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight - year old ? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists ? Please , there 's more reality in The Matrix . Also , the leader puts down his real pistol and " accidentally " picks up a plastic pistol ; apparently , he could not tell the difference . Even with a glove on , one should be able to do that . Just because they look the same does not mean anything ; there is other senses then sight . The traps are unrealistic as well ; if any one of them actually worked , the criminals would be dead . But , Hollywood intends for us to " laugh " at the " funny " results of the traps . I did not laugh ; I sighed and rolled my eyes.<br /><br />But , I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie ; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one . Otherwise , skip this one for the sake of your pride . Home Alone 3 also raises a question . We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie , but did he write it as well ?
0 Home Alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies . It 's the cream of the crop , or s * * * if you tend to be more cynical , as it ranks up ( or down ) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones : Viva Rock Vegas . In fact , it could even be worse than those two , since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity . This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling . No other movie has made me cringe in pain . Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.<br /><br />First off , the plot is ridiculous . It revolves around a chip in a remote control car ( ? ! ) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it . Dumb stuff.<br /><br />The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones , with boobytraps and all , but watching these boobytraps being executed is , rather than being funny , incredibly unpleasant to watch . I did n't laugh ( or even so much as smile ) once , rather , I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid . The bird , rather than providing comic relief , was unfunny and annoying.<br /><br />The acting , as done by a bunch of no names , ranges from poor to atrocious . There is not a single good performance here . Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid , while the terrorists act ( and judging by their movie credits , look ) as they 've been hastily picked off the street ... and well , that 's it.<br /><br />I can see some people saying : " Man , it 's for the kids . Do n't dis it , man . " Well MAN , kids may like this , but they can get a hell of a lot better . See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out . Hell , even Scooby Doo and Garfield ( which suck - see those reviews for more ) are better than this ! < br /><br />So in short , this is an irredeemably atrocious movie . This was clearly recycled for the money , as it almost completely rips off the first two ; the only thing is , it completely insults the first two as well . No human , kid or otherwise , should find any reason to see Home Alone 3 . Ever . It 's THAT bad.<br /><br />0/5 stars
0 Remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid " movie " is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty , salted spoon . Perhaps " Home Alone 2 : Lost in New York " ( 1992 ) was a bit on the predictable side , but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization I have ever heard of . A boy fighting off spies / terrorists when he 's home alone in a Chicago suburb with the chickenpox ? Ridiculous ! Why did this film have to be made ? I am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time , but rather learning experiences . However , this is actually a waste of time . It should be avoided at all costs .
0 I loved the first two movies , but this movie was just a waste of time and money ( for me and the studio ) . I 'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie . The thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car , that can go into another house are ridiculous . Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny , but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny . Believe me this movie is just a waste of time .
0 I hated this movie . It was absolutely horrible , poor , poor , PITIFUL acting , REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals that were n't even the LEAST BIT funny(unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good ) . all the boobie traps are weak , pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck did n't go above 20 bucks a week . This movie is absolutely lousy , it 's not worth even renting . In fact do n't even watch it on t.v . ! Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two ! I BARELY give this 1 star(out of 10 ) . Just trust me when I say , if you liked the first two , and you are not a complete stupid person , you will not like this movie , do not watch this movie ! ! !
0 Whoever thought that ANOTHER Home Alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined ... Same plot , different kid , more villains ( which leads to MORE endless stupidity in the traps ) . The other two films were bad enough , and this is where it hits rock bottom . People may as well watch the other films for plot , as it 's all identical .
0 I do n't know what you guys are inhaling , but please stop . This movie was complete trash.<br /><br />Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was lovable , cute , sweet , loving , and extremely fun to watch . He had that innocence but at the same time , he was strong as well.<br /><br />This new kid , Alex ? Annoying as all hell ! Just a blatant ripoff at trying to match Culkin 's charm and grace , failing miserably at that.<br /><br />The villains , complete crap . Harry and Marv , they were such an entertaining on screen team . They were comedic , they were humorous , and just made you really want to root for Culkin even more , which is what a good villain is suppose to do . These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern , absolutely PERFECT for those roles . On the other hand , in 3 , we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again , try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains . Not saying they were horrible , but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining . More on the corny side actually.<br /><br />Then we got the actual movies . Part 1 and 2 , classics . Memorable . Perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions . It makes you fall in love with the story , and care about the characters . Simply , memorable and close to being masterpieces . Part 3 ? Masterpiece of crap . Enough said.<br /><br />All and all , I do n't know why people like this . I think people really do n't know what a good movie is anymore . Its a crappy sequel rip - off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that I wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of.<br /><br />Run , run away from this garbage . And lets not even start with Part 4 !
0 If you want to laugh like crazy , rent Cage . Cage is about two war heroes , Billy and Scott who are best friends . When Billy is shot in Vietnam , he is unable to fend for himself , so Scott takes him in.<br /><br />I have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters . Billy and Scott love to " wrestle " and Scott tells Billy that he is " still sore from last night , " among other things.<br /><br />Wonderful catch phrases like " Shut the sh!t up " and " Ping Pang Pong , cut the sh!t " will keep you laughing for hours . The native American guys that are supposed to be playing Mexican gang members are also top notch . As they say , it 's " party time right now . Ba - ba - ba - ba ba - ba . " I could go on forever , but just watch this movie and laugh your a$$ off . It was so funny I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
0 Cage ( 1989 ) was another one of those low budget " buddy " action flicks that were produced during the 80 's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs . and Lethal Weapon . This one stars Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as to former Vietnam Vets who happen to run a local dive bar . Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in ' Nam . But Lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft . Although he 's huge , Lou has the brain of a child . One day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat the tar out of them . But payback 's a mother . They crash the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing . That is until these two thugs come into the picture ( one of them 's a real nice guy ) who have a plan in mind.<br /><br />The film 's a waste of time . Maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked . Alas , it does n't and the audience is left holding the bag . Oh well . It 's too bad because you have all the elements for a great B - movie . Better luck next time , I guess.<br /><br />Not recommended.<br /><br />xxx
0 I rented this film to see what might be a bloody , non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action - drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard . Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks , he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever . The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard , I swear ! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar . Super homoerotic . Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back . There is no good fight scenes at all , the punches are two inches away from a person . Characters personalities change in matter of seconds . One guy is a bad and in the next scene he 's good . The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick . I hated this film .
0 Mark Pirro 's " Deathrow Gameshow " of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts , but occasionally very funny nevertheless . This movie could certainly have been a lot better , the acting is terrible , and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times , but the concept is funny , and it has some hilarious moments.<br /><br />In the near future ( the year 1991 ) , game shows have changed . Chuck Todean ( John Mc Cafferty ) hosts a game show called " Live Or Die " , in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives , and for money . Candidates who fail , get executed on the air using many different methods , such as guillotines , electric chairs , and other , more bizarre devices of execution , followed by applause from the cheering studio audience . The show is , of course , more than controversial , and Chuck has made lots of enemies ... <br /><br />"Deathrow Gameshow " is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects , and the acting is terrible , but it is without doubt fun in many parts , especially if you 're a fan of dark humor . You have n't missed anything if you have n't seen it , but it is definitely funny and a good time waster . 4/10
0 There just is n't enough here . There a few funny spots , but not really enough . I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies . I was expecting this to be a hidden gem . IT WAS NOT . It was a hidden turd.<br /><br />The whole time I was watching it I was thinking , " Geez , I could do better than that and I 'm a moron " . Do n't believe the few good reviews . I was suckered in by them . At no point did I laugh at loud . Maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man , it fell flat today . This movie had promise , it just did n't deliver on it . Maybe if they rewrote it a few more times . I ca nt fault the actors . They were n't the best , but they just did n't have much with which to work . This movie failed because of threadbare writing . SORELY disappointed .
0 Tainted look at kibbutz life < br /><br />This film is less a cultural story about a boy 's life in a kibbutz , but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general . In the first two minutes of the movie , the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves . And it 's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical " kibbutznikim . " Besides the two main characters , a clinically depressed woman and her young son , every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well  evil . < br /><br />The story centers on how the kibbutz , like some sort of cult , slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows . There is no happiness , no joy , no laughter in this kibbutz . Every character / situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny , hypocrisy , violence , cultism , repression etc . For example , while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his " jewish " physical appearance and brutish personality . He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother . He treats these volunteers like trash . After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he has n't seen in a long time due to his military service , he orders , Quote  " Linda , go take shower and I cum in two minutes . " < br /><br />There is one other " good " character in this movie  a European foreigner who plays the mother 's boyfriend . When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother 's son , the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist 's arm . He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for " violent " behavior against one of the kibbutz members . More hypocrisy : The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex can not happen before age 18 , or without love and gives an account of the actual act that 's supposed to be humorous for the audience , but is really just stupid . She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy 's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse . < br /><br />The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult . Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders . The mother apparently ca n't " escape " the kibbutz , although in reality , anyone was / is always free to come and go as they choose . It 's a mystery how the boy 's father died , but you can rest assured , the kibbutz " drove him to it " and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless , wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son . < br /><br />That 's the gist of this movie . One dimensional characters , over dramatization , dry performances , and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience 's head  that kibbutz life was degrading , miserable and even deadly for those who did n't " fit in . " I feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz . But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs .
0 I saw this movie , just now , not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in Israel . and to summarize everything right now , I will just say : this is not a good film.<br /><br />This is Dror Shaul 's second feature film , and I have to admit that his first and the TV drama he made before this picture are much better . further more , this is his first attempt at directing a drama . the early works were comedies , and were funny and effective.<br /><br />The first thing you have to know if you 'll ever see this film : Israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of Israel . the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire , and some of them disappear one by one . the kibbutz , Hebrew word for collective , was a sort of village for members only , where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life . with the change in social values with time , it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed , locked within the dogma rules , with no ticket out . the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90 's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive . the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that.<br /><br />But , I regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz . once , it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment . but the film shows the opposite . that the kibbutz , with it 's socialist dogma , was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people , with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective . this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism : your individuality is the most important thing . you must place yourself in the center , and no one else but you is the matter . this is the philosophy the film stands for , and that 's just it 's first sin.<br /><br />If you disagree with me on the political side , I 'm sure you will agree that the acting , the tone of the film , it 's script and it 's direction are the four sins that follow . the film has no real visual text and none of it 's shots is something to remember . it is also very " delicate " , a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions , which do not surface , not in the film and not with the viewer . it brings nothing but boredom.<br /><br />Can someone please explain : why this film won so many prizes ? maybe because it shows that Israel is in line with the rest of the world , hating socialist and human values ? or maybe it shows that Israel is a " delicate " place , not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism ? that we are basically very human and good people , capable of emotions , especially when they are fake ones , just like capitalism expects us to be ? or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of Israeli cinema in recent years , a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the Jewish state ? no matter what the answer is , it 's not a good one . not for the world , not for human values and not for the Jews .
0 Any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf ca n't promise much . As for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago , well I was there and it just was n't like that . OK every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film ( like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night ) but you ca n't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those - shall we say - naughty traits . Each kibbutz had its own problems , but hardly any kibbutz had all of them . The views of Israel were great . I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called the Emek ( valley ) . Yes , and the acting was good too , so you see it was n't all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably on purpose too .
0 Yes AWA wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show . First they had a very short interviewer named Marty O'Neil who made " Rock n Roll " Buck Zumhofe look like a nose tackle . Then it was Gene Okerland who when he got " mad as the wrestler " would say either " Were out of time " or " Well be right back " acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced . After he went to the WWF Ken Resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who " Georgeous " Jimmy Garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing . After he jumped ship then Larry Nelson came on board which he was so bad that Phyllis George would of been an improvement ! Then there 's Doug McLeod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows ! Then he was offered more pay by the Minnesota North Stars hockey team . At ringside who can forget Roger Kent who 's mispronouncing of words and sentences were historic Like when a wrestler was big " He s a big - on ! " punched or kicked in the guts " right in the gussets"or when kicked " He punted him " or " the " piledriver should be banned " after Nick Bockwinkle used it on a helpless opponent.(Right Roger like you care ! ) After he left to greener money(WWF ) they had Rod Trongard who 's announcing style was great but different . Like when a wrestler scraped the sole of his boot across another guys forehead he 'd say"Right across the front - e - lobe " or when a wrestler is in trouble " He s in a bad bad way " . He also would say AWA the baddest , toughest , meanest , most scientific wrestlers are here right in the AWA!(No extra money Verne Gagne ! ) After he left(WWF ) Larry(Wheres Phyllis ? ! ) Nelson took over and I would talk to someone else or totally ignore him.(WWE wisely did n't take him ! ) Also Greg Gagne had the ugliest wrestling boots I ever saw a yellow color of something I do n't want to say . Also when he s looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest restroom ! Jumpin Jim Brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why Greg was ever his partner . Jerry Blackwell(RIP)was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why Verne had himself win against him.(Puhleeeeze ! ) Then when Vince McMahon would hire Gagnes jobbers , he would make most of them wrestle squash matches . I like to see the Gagne family say wrestlings real now !
