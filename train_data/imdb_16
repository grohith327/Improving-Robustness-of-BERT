0 Maiden Voyage is just that . I 'd like to say straight away that I watched 5mins of this before I just could n't stand it anymore . As already stated in another comment , this film does n't fall into the whole " so bad it 's good " thing , it 's just bad . The acting is awful , the sfx are poor , and the story is bland and stupid . Even the extras suck , the " bag guy guards " and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistols.<br /><br />Don't even bother watching this film , the only thing special about it is that , no matter how low your expectations are , you will still be disappointed .
0 What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make , running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate . The whole production feels cheap and shabby , and it 's not helped by a " big name " star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he 's given in a credible fashion.<br /><br />At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material ; they 're clearly watching the clock here . Bang out the scenes , get the pay cheque , go home , and try to forget all about it.<br /><br />It 's not particularly badly scripted or filmed ; there are no real clangers , it 's just utterly anodyne , and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras . The pacing is a little bizarre ; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub - plot is only begun after the main action starts , which makes it feel irrelevant.<br /><br />Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored , and for being a fun game of " spot the Kiwi bit parters " ; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena : Warrior Princess . The saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />McBain ( played by Gary Busey , before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons ) is a ( typically ) unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten . Avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film , the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico where a top secret American super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through , only to be taken hostage , along with the crew , by a gang of terrorists.<br /><br />This cheap looking ( even by 80s standards ) , boring little action film was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain Mr Joshua in Lethal Weapon . He just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here , edgy and zany as ever ( with ' butthorn ' being his trademark put down for the bad guys ) , but without the material to back him up . Henry Silva has presence as a screen villain , but he 's totally miscast here as an Arab leader ( in a red beret ! ) and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden . He 's just one of a host of action film character actors , including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick , who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix . After a dull first half without much exciting action , things do pick up a bit at the end , but it 's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun . *
0 What an incomprehensible mess of a movie . Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom ( and from the size of the jar he 's been shot about fifty times by now ) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico . Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear . And you 'll never hear another screenplay feature the word " butthorn " either . Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from " Lethal Weapon " and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity . William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier , the same character he played in " Red Dawn " a few years earlier . After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies . Sadly he 'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in " Every Which Way You Can . "
0 Take " Rambo , " mix in some " Miami Vice , " slice the budget about 80 % , and you 've got something that a few ten - year - old boys could come up with if they have a big enough backyard & too much access to " Penthouse . " Cop and ex - commando McBain ( Busey , and with a name like McBain , you know he 's as gritty as they come ) is recruited to retrieve an American supertank that has been stolen & hidden in Mexico . Captured with the tank were hardbitten Sgt . Major O'Rourke ( Jones ) & McBain 's former love Devon ( Fluegel ) , the officer in command & now meat for the depraved terrorists / spies / drug peddlers , who have no sense of decency , blah , blah , blah . For an action movie with depraved sex , there 's a dearth of action and not much sex . The running joke is that McBain gets shot all the time & survives , keeping the bullets as souvenirs . Apparently the writers did n't see " The Magnificent Seven " ( " The man for us is the one who GAVE him that face " ) , nor thought to give McBain even a pretense of intelligence . Even for a budget actioner , the production values are poor , with distant shots during dialog and very little movement . The main prop , the tank , is silly enough for an Ed Wood production . Fluegel , who might have been a blonde Julia Roberts ( she had a far bigger role in " Crime Story " than Julia ! ) has to go from simpering to frightened to butt - kicking & back again on an instant 's notice . Jones , who 's been in an amazing array of films , pretty much hits bottom right here . Both he & Busey were probably just out for some easy money & a couple of laughs . Look for talented , future character actor Danny Trejo ( " Heat , " " Once Upon a Time in Mexico " ) in a stereotyped , menacing bit part . Much too dull even for a guilty pleasure , " Bulletproof " is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house but want people to think there 's someone home .
0 What happens when an army of wetbacks , towelheads , and Godless Eastern European commies gather their forces south of the border ? Gary Busey kicks their butts , of course . Another laughable example of Reagan - era cultural fallout , Bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by L Q Jones and Thalmus Rasulala .
0 There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof : it reminds you just how bad bad can be . We often see films which we describe as " pretty awful " or " not much good " , but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films are n't " good " they are no way as stinkingly bad as Bulletproof . This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru ' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation ( i.e. to give me a present ) . It could have been a serendipitous find but it was n't : this is so utterly clichéd , so badly written , so poorly directed , so badly acted that I 'm surprised everyone involved has n't been arrested and sent down for 10 years . God , it 's awful . I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in , but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable . This is n't one of them . It is simply bad . I stopped watching after 45 minutes , and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin .
0 I still ca n't believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap . This movie is worse than " Deadly Friend".The plot is stupid , the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull . I do n't know why Wes Craven hates his debut " Last House on the Left "- an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes(probably)this turkey . Don't get me wrong , I really like some of his movies , but it was a real torture sitting and watching this .
0 Unspeakably discombobulated turkey , a mix of anti - Nazi musical ( ! ! ) , pre - war Americana and Agatha Christie whodunit spoof with one big , big problem : it 's deadly unfunny . Besides the single - digit I.Q. plot and dialog , the most amazing aspect of " Lady ... " is the berserk casting . Gene Wilder ( star AND co - writer ) tries hard at it all : he plays a romantic lead ( with his looks ! ! and his age ! ! he and Woody Allen should start a club for clueless , mirrorless ageing comedians ) , and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart , and tries to sing and dance , and succeeds in NONE ! ! A looong shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks.<br /><br />For a while I thought I was having a myopia fit , because everybody in the movie keeps saying Cherry Jones is this pretty hot chick , and that Michael Cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion ! ! The guy who plays Claire Bloom 's male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies ! ! Mike Starr 's over - the - top acting as the most incompetent , phoniest cop you EVER saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history . The saddest note is to see wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted . At least I hope both stars payed their bills back home ( and subsequently fired their agents ) with this flop . No wonder acting prodigy Sukowa returned to Germany after she saw what Hollywood had in store for her!!<br /><br />If you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director , study this one - otherwise stay away ! ! ! - 1/10
0 ( Spoilers galore ) This is an absolutely awful film . First of all it has that guy from medium . I guess he 's made a career out of playing super doting dads . It was OK the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again ! And so it goes , this film moves in excruciating real time . At one point , I started imaging it was days later , until I was reminded that the story line was only at the next day ... in the early afternoon still ! I 'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life . First of all they are presented as sort of a Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid . But they drive an old blue Volvo . Those types stopped driving Volvos decades ago . Today they drive Priuses . But in 2002 , I 'm sure they still were n't driving Volvos.<br /><br />OK , then there 's Wendigo . A " mysterious Indian man " gives the boy a little magic Wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic . C'mon ... are we still doing ancient Indian mysteries . Just to drive it home , they pan across every Indian statue in their tourist trap upstate New York town . American Indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film ! Oh , and about Wendigo . He is not actually the cause of the horror . He does n't kill the kid 's dad which is the most horrible thing in the film ... he 's just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle . The Wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad ... oh , but wait , it seemed earlier that Wendigo was kind of mad at the dad , maybe because he killed a deer ... so then Wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed ... but ... <br /><br />And so it goes ... insulting , boring and nonsensical . There is no reason to watch this film at all .
0 I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing , he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor . Like many others on here , I do n't know how to categorize this film , it was n't scary or spooky so ca n't be called a horror , the plot was so wafer thin it ca n't be a drama , there was no suspense so it ca n't be a thriller , its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project . People who liked this film used words , like " ambiguity " and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that was n't there . Like the Blair witch , people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying . This movie actually started off well with the family " meeting " the locals after hitting a deer . It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes , ( well over half the film ) , nothing happened , the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining . It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie . Finally , when something does happen , its not even clear how the father was shot , how he dies , ( the nurse said his liver was only grazed ) , and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects . The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way , the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied , i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself . It did n't .
0 The opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes . The shots are generic , conventional , and of television movie quality . The snow drenched scenery is gorgeous , yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery , the overwhelming feeling being that of distance . Some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional , the dialogue however is clunky and artificial , having little bearing on ' real ' conversations at all seemingly . Any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing , which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings . The action is slow and underwhelming , the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head , but so slowly that you barely notice , yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation.<br /><br />The mixture of genres that the Fessenden has seemingly tried to use ; psychological thriller , horror and family drama , although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue . The way in which the husband , wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic . The themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films , an instant example being that of The Shining ( 1980 ) . The family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script.<br /><br />The family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film , Fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time . The ' stalker ' figure Otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped . The main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to , their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling . Although the ignorance of the Erik per Sullivan 's young character by his parents is presumably part of the story , surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly does n't exist ? People can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in . You can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but I think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning , rather than these vacuous sub - human creations .
0 I first learned of the Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz 's " Scary Stories " books : according to that story , the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along , and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you . While it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion , Schwartz 's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea.<br /><br />The movie " Wendigo " does n't . It basically consists of every horror flick cliché : family moves to new house and strange things start happening , anyone who harms them is asking for it , and everyone had better listen to the old Indian guy . I 've seen this stuff so many times that I no longer bother to count.<br /><br />Anyway , avoid it . Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan ( Dewey on " Malcolm in the Middle " ) have done far better than this .
0 This movie is S - L - O - W. Spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to ' begin'.<br /><br />The setting was bleak , the script was bleak , the cinematography was bleak , the plot was bleak , the budget was low ( not that all low budget movies are bad , but this one had no redeeming features).<br /><br />The plot was more consumed with a vengeful , slightly deranged hunter than the actual Wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie . This in itself was disappointing as this ' Wendigo ' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag . Everything about the movie was uninspiring.<br /><br />The parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son . Whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script I 'm not sure , but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levels.<br /><br />There was no food for thought , nothing to pique an interest . With no real intrigue or chill factor , this movie creaked along so painfully , you just could n't care less what happened by the end.<br /><br />Wendigo 's ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of ' Mr Bean 's Holiday ' : a movie which is artistic and nonsensical , trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful , but coming across as pretentious and boring.<br /><br />I would never want to watch this again . I only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but it did n't .
0 If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo , I suggest you pick up a copy of Algernon Blackwell 's original story . This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book.<br /><br />I loved the book when I read it as a kid ( In " Campfire Chillers " by E.M. Freeman)and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out . I was so disappointed when I finally saw it . Another thing is that there were too many PC ( Politically Correct ) undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film . When the book was written PC did n't even exist.<br /><br />My suggestion is do n't waste your time or money ! ! If you see it on the video store shelf LEAVE IT THERE .
0 for all the subtle charms this student film may contain , was anyone else bored to death waiting WENDINGO to show his paper macho face??<br /><br />the anti - climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop.<br /><br />don't get me wrong , i 'm all into exploring America 's dark underbelly , but this is a turd - a - flambé that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p.clarkson looks hot taking it.<br /><br />sadly , from a guy from wings.<br /><br />the best 2 minutes the film has to offer.<br /><br />if you felt like ripping off DELIVERANCE , you could do better .
0 i was disappointed . the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box . Having said that , the characters were well developed , the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me . I kept waiting for that big AHHHHH or BOO ! But it never came.<br /><br />Furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects . Thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense . Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if your looking for a low - budget but well conceived horror movie .
0 As I was watching this movie I was thinking , OK it 'll get good any moment ... I was wrong . The real best part of this movie was when it was over . A complete waste of 92 minutes . All seriousness aside the best part was when the Wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you could n't really even see him that good . And the tail end was really kind of dumb as well . There was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down . The worse part is there was more talk of the Wendigo then there was Wendigo . For the creature to be so bad , you definitely could n't tell it by this movie .
0 if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one ... incredible bad ... the main characters ( the mom , the dad and son ) are OK . Specially the mother she 's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary . But does the the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point , Triller and Good Script . the script has n't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing . If you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it , otherwise just stay at home and sleep . oh ... actually there was something funny : the movie 's from 2001 but we could n't realize it since the image is so bad ( like on mini - dv ) and the cars are so old ( like 70 and 80 's ) .
0 Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies . This movie was an insult to watch , the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography . The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move with a passion ! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie . Someone mentioned that this film was about a child 's imagination , okay that s all good and fine . But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did . I mean come on , the Indian in the store . Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo ? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here , so you think okay creepy ghost scenario , but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy . That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic . The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG ! ! ! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this ! ! This is a move that I recommend NOT to watch , there are definitely better quality films out there that wo n't insult your intelligence ! Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie , I would have demanded my money back ! For those that were easily entertained by this movie .... it 's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie .
0 I remember back when I was little when I was away at camp and we would campout under the stars . There was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out . Well , when I found Wendigo at the library , I checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp . Well , much to my dismay , I was so far from the truth . Wendigo is really bad . The story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin , which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods , and they run into a deer . Well , it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk . The movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film . It was n't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the " wendigo . " My suggestion is that you stay very far away this film . It will leave you wanting your hour and a half back .
0 I 've seen many horror shows over the years , like Nightstalker , that dealt with the Wendigo legend , so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the Halloween season . Man was I mistaken . The whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy , but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property . Ve - ery scary - not ! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor , another total loser.<br /><br />It 's getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood puts forward about scary movies , since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore . What idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made ? Go back to the drawing board fellas , and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around .
0 I suppose if you like endless dialogue that does n't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _ Angel _ , you 'll enjoy the film . Me ? All I wanted was a nice , tight little story , and it was n't there . The pacing was practically backward , plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue , and there was absolutely no sense of dread , or tension , or ANYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the redneck ? Is it the Wendigo ? No , it 's a cameraman on speed . That 's not scary . It does n't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you 're scared by MTV . Like those reviewers before me , I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Terrible film .
0 This was n't all that great . Not terrible or hateful or anything , just forgettable.<br /><br />It had a sort of , um , hesitant , diluted air , like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire . So we were left with weak mix of the three . The actors seemed kinda lost.<br /><br />Also , the ideas were really tired and recycled , almost zombified themselves . How many more times do we have to be told the 50 's in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity ? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism ? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing ? Old hat.<br /><br />Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was . I know it was a comedy and all , but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor , some relatable guide through the story , to make it engaging . For the ' hero ' kid to watch an old woman , two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders , then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way . The mum was the same . If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level , then you risk losing me and that 's what happened.<br /><br />Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough , it was a handsome film , especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons ' house . Also , the opening newsreel was cute , in a been - done - before - but - still - funny sort of way.<br /><br />And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and that comes from someone who is n't a big fan of Billy Connolly : Movie Star . I just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene , but he played it pretty low - key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film.<br /><br />All in all , not great though .
0 This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me , as well as a 9/10 . Here is why : As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd , where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration , this movie WILL bore you . It 's basically a family drama similar to what you 'd see on the Lifetime channel , but put in a horror universe . The story and formula are age - old , retreaded hundreds of times . If you 're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts , you 'll be disappointed . Take away the zombies and you 'll have something just as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind , tripping on cheese . This is the 6/10.<br /><br />However , the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over - the - top . It 's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you 're half - drunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release . The idea gets a 9/10 from me . The only reason it is n't perfect is because they could have taken it even further , but they didn't.<br /><br />The mix of both is mixed . I thought it was funny , but as with most all comedies , it was n't THAT funny . I had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted . There were moments of utter genius , but there were also moments of pure boredom.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over - the - top risk and original ideas . I just ca n't say it was perfect , or even near it , because of the lack of originality to the plot.<br /><br />A GREAT family movie . A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys ( or girls ) . A great movie to watch with anyone . . . but if you watch it alone , it will be a bit boring . Other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer.<br /><br />4/10
0 There 's been a vogue for the past few years for often - as - not ironic zombie - related films , as well as other media incarnations of the flesh- eating resurrected dead . " Fido " is a film that 's either an attempt to cash in on that , simply a manifestation of it , or both -- and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies . The joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped , squeaky - clean , alternate - history ( we are in the wake of a great Zombie War , and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves ) version of a 1950s suburb . < br /><br />It 's a moderately funny concept on its own , and enough perhaps for a five - minute comedy sketch , but it ca n't hold up a feature - film on its own . The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again , and loses all effectiveness . The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders . The word " zombie " is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh . < br /><br />The very broadness and artificiality of the representation of " the nineteen fifties " here ca n't help but irritate me . It is so stylized , in it evidently " Pleasantville-"inspired way , that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s - ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 . There is something obnoxiously sneering about it , as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open , down - to - Earth , and superior the 2000s are . < br /><br />Because the characters are such broad representations of pop - culture 1950s " types , " it 's difficult to develop much emotional investment in them . Each has a few character traits thrown at him or her -- Helen is obsessed with appearances , and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father -- but they remain quite two - dimensional . Performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine . The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie , who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in " Frankenstein " actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who can not speak . < br /><br />There are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around -- to commodity fetishism , racism , classism , war paranoia , et cetera , but none of it really works on a comprehensive level , and the filmmakers don;t really stick with anything . < br /><br />Unfortunately , this film does n't really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of " Look ! Zombies in ' Leave it to Beaver ! ' " for a good hour- and - a - half .
0 This would be a watchable Hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing . It relies on the typical American thriller plot - " who is going to outsmart everyone " . Acting is below average , but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises . Film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material . All in all , if you do n't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project , this is a film to watch . I guess that would be enough to say on this film , everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough .
0 Loved Part One , The Impossible Planet , but whoops , what a disappointment part two ' The Satan Pit ' is . The cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was - nothing coming out of the pit . Then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story , the Beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence , so no Doctor / villain confrontation I 'd been anticipating . The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the TARDIS fell through the planet crust . And finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason - I mean , why not plunge the Beast into the Hole as soon as the pit opened ? Why not plunge him in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway . Why not - I could go on but I 've lost interest ...
0 I do n't know how to describe this movie . It 's definitely one of the weirdest movies I 've seen in a long time . It is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places . The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who 's into gore & splatter . I found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes . The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite unsettling.<br /><br />The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone . But if you 're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for.<br /><br />If you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment , give it a try!<br /><br />My rating : 4/10 ( maybe a little too weird for my taste )
0 Well , I do like the gore in this movie - it is genuingly unsetteling . Anyone that 's been to the dentist will know why . The story really is n't that bad , Corbin Bersen 's character 's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies.<br /><br />I've seen worse acting , directing , script , etc . but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie . So it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not . I tried to watch the sequel , but it was exactly , exactly the same thing as this movie . Just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist , then this is the movie for you !
0 There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of , let 's say , little monsters or scary looking dolls . Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie , really.<br /><br />Dr . Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) has been a successful dentist for several years now , but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps , and he brings his anger and frustration to his work . Well , give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth , and you can probably guess what happens next ... <br /><br />As I said , brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should . In particular the ending is a huge let down . Last note : watch for Mark Ruffalo ( You Can Count On Me , Eternal Sunshine ... ) in this one.<br /><br />5/10 .
0 I really wanted to like this movie , but it never gave me a chance . It 's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme , but it fails miserably . It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high - school kids for some school project , and that 's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at . There is no subtlety and , more damningly for a mockumentary , it never once feels like a documentary . And while the lines are n't funny in the first place , an attempt at dead - pan delivery would have helped -- certainly , anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to people who like " comedies " in the vein of " Big Momma 's House " or " Norbit " ; people who think that words like " butt " are inherently hysterically funny . Other people should stay away and not waste their time .
0 Obviously , I did n't care for Things to Come ( aka " The Shape of Things to Come " ) as much as most viewers . That means that there is a good chance that you 'll enjoy it more than I did . At any rate , you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view.<br /><br />Directed by William Cameron Menzies , who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director , this is a film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own novel by the same name . In my eyes , it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.<br /><br />The film opens in 1940 in a London - like " Everytown " . War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them . It does . And it turns into a decades - long affair that basically destroys civilization . Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath . We see two pilots , one downed , coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting . We meet a post - apocalyptic community ruled over by a would - be warlord . We meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society . We see the way that technology is changing . And finally , we 're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 , where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.<br /><br />That might all sound potentially very exciting , but it just does not work as a film . Structurally , the film is far too episodic , with little to dramatically tie it together . By the third segment , I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters . I had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments . There 's a constant parade of new faces . We do n't get to learn anything about any of them.<br /><br />It does n't help that the individual segments , with a couple exceptions , tend to be awkwardly directed and edited . They are also occasionally manipulative -- it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film . But maybe contradictorily , the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally.<br /><br />In fact , one overlong section is more like a music video / industrial promotional video . If features shots of building the futuristic city , with lots of large machinery , lots of welding , and so on . At one point , a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass . The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score . I ca n't say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.<br /><br />But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is " a film about ideas " . That may be true , but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way . One , it still does n't make it work _ as a film _ , that is , as a visual and aural dramatic artwork , and two , there are far too many ideas presented here.<br /><br />The principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations . That 's a fine thing to make a film about . It 's also remarkably prescient of World War II , as the Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 ( released in 1936 ) . Wells has some interesting things to say about war , some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film . For example , the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out , or will at any moment . The overall message seems a trifle pessimistic . Wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that can not be excised , although it does n't preclude " progress "-- in fact , maybe it fuels progress , at least indirectly.<br /><br />That would certainly be enough for one film . However , there are many more ideas here . The scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film . It deals with a complex dilemma . One pilot has shot the other down , but is now coming to assist him . But the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field . They ca n't both breathe the gas without harm . A girl comes along . They only have two functioning gas - masks between them . The pilot who was shot down offers his mask , as he says he 's dying anyway . What to do ? It 's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length , but the ideas -- the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war -- are enough to build a film on.<br /><br />Another example . During the scenes featuring the would - be warlord , in the post - apocalyptic environment , there is a nasty contagious disease called the " wandering sickness " going around . It turns victims into something like drunken zombies . The usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease . This material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought . It 's a great idea and deserved its own film.<br /><br />Similarly , Wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas . That was enough for its own film , too . It 's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes , especially when it 's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction.<br /><br />Still , there are reasons to give Things to Come at least one viewing . If you 're at all a sci - fi buff , this is a historically important film . Given Menzies ' background , the production and set designs are interesting , even if the cinematography seems extremely dated . It 's also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his " predictions " . I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon , which was strongly reminiscent of George Méliès ' 1902 A Trip to the Moon ( aka Le Voyage dans la lune ) . Just do n't expect too much from Things to Come .
0 I ca nt describe how terrible this movie is . Am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting ? The Men of Rohan look 100 % fake with their poorly colored hair , that does nt even come close to matching what the actors look like . The orcs looked terrible . Why does gandalf walk with a bad limp ? Why ca nt they pronounce things correctly ? Saruman is nt Aruman . There were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation*sp * of Tolkiens characters . All and all i m glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal , it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion . Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work . Hell , even the cartoon version of ROTK is better then this dribble . 2/10
0 Some people do n't like the animation . Personally , I think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done . There are lots of older cartoons that I just love . My problems with this movie are not the animation , but basically the way it was constructed . The characters are all just ... well , goofy . And for this movie , they should n't be . Apparently , everyone in LOTR has a limping problem ( for starters . ) Just the way they acted in general annoyed me . My two sisters and I were laughing through most of this movie . I think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones , they would n't have gone . I 'm glad I rented this and did n't buy it . There are few movies that give me a headache . This was one of them . However , this is n't the worst movie I 've ever seen , although it ranks up there . Or down there , depending on your view .
0 I saw this movie during a Tolkien - themed Interim class during my sophomore year of college . I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing , but they were n't within constant eyesight.<br /><br />Let 's get it out of the way : the Peter Jackson ' Lord of the Rings ' films do owe something to the Bakshi film . In Jackson 's version of The Fellowship of the Ring , for instance , the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshi 's film , shot by shot . You could call this plagiarism or homage , depending on your agenda . < br /><br />I'm sure the similarities do n't stop there . I 'm not going to do any research to find out what they are , because that would imply I have some mote of respect for this film . I 'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around.<br /><br />This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor , and many , many people died in the accident . I 've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- If I 've left out anything else that offended me it 's because I 'm completely overwhelmed , confronted with a wealth of failure ( and , at high points , mediocrity).<br /><br />*Due to heavy use of rotoscoping , Gandalf is no longer a gentle , wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom ( whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film).<br /><br />*Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as ' Aruman ' during the film , without explanation . He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason.<br /><br />*Sam is flat out hideous . The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying . Yes , hobbits are small like children , but they are NOT children.<br /><br />*Merry and Pippin are never introduced -- they simply appear during a scene change with a one - sentence explanation . The film is filled with sloppy editing like this.<br /><br />*Frodo , Sam , Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road . One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back -- which was not visible before -- and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into " la - la - la"s . AWFUL.<br /><br />*Aragorn , apparently , is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic ( no pants ) , complete with huge , square pilgrim belt buckle . He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie -- oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass.<br /><br />*The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil . They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace . This is disturbing to be sure , but not frightening.<br /><br />*The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen ( in which they stare at Frodo , who is on the other side on horseback ) goes on forever , during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and ... do nothing else . The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo 's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound . It turns out to be more plodding than anything else.<br /><br />*Gimli the Dwarf is just as tall as Legolas the Elf . He 's a DWARF . There is simply no excuse for that . He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome . It 's a crude but accurate description.<br /><br />*Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudd 's golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode . He looks ridiculous.<br /><br />*Despite the similarity to Tolkien 's illustration , the Balrog is howl inducing and the least - threatening villain in the entire film . It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers , and it 's barely taller than Gandalf . " Purists " may prefer this Balrog , but I 'll take Jackson 's version any day.<br /><br />*The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing . Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments . I 'm not asking for action - packed scenes like those in Jackson 's film , but they ARE supposed to be fighting.<br /><br />*Treebeard makes a very short appearance , and I was sorry he bothered to show up at all . Watch the film , you 'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Alright , now for the GOOD parts of the film.<br /><br />*Some of the voice acting is pretty good . It is n't that Aragorn SOUNDS bad , he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant.<br /><br />*Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal ; like Tom Bombadil , she seems immune to the Ring 's powers of temptation , and her voice actress is n't horrible either.<br /><br />*Boromir 's death is n't as heart wrenching as in Jackson 's portrayal of the same scene , but it 's still appropriately dramatic ( and more true to his death in the book , though I do n't believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did).<br /><br />*As my professor pointed out ( between whispered threats ) , the orcs ( mainly at Helm 's Deep , if I 'm correct ) resemble the war - ravaged corpses of soldiers , a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what 's being attempted.<br /><br />*While this is n't really a positive point about the film , Bakshi ca n't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie , or so I 've been told -- the project was on a tight budget , and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher - ups ( who I 'm sure had n't read the books).<br /><br />Let me be clear : I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude . I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product . < br /><br />Overall , I can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien 's classic trilogy even for laughs , unless you 've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters , places and events . I 'm sure somebody , somewhere , will pick a copy of this up in confusion ; if you do , keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it .
0 I remember going to see the movie in the summer of ' 78 with my parents , and being pretty into it at the time . Of course , I was seven at the time.<br /><br />Right before the Jackson movies came out , my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid - way through the animation process for this movie , and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production . Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping , the animation technique for people on a budget , this is saying something . Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word . There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen , with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.<br /><br />Because of budget constraints , the movie -- already a compression of " The Fellowship of the Rings " and part of " The Two Towers " -- was pared down even more . What you get is sort of like a film - strip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.<br /><br />Its not all bad , though , the animation brings a warmth to it , that I found lacking in the Jackson movies . Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.<br /><br />This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came . Several years later , a half - hearted half - hour long TV special was aired , which was meant to wrap things up . All I will say about that is that it was a musical .
0 I have n't seen this movie in a while , so I 'm afraid I ca n't be very specific about details ... It did have some interesting points . Ralph Bakshi 's attempt at an animated adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien 's masterpiece was a very ambitious project , so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production . Therefore , not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy ( with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made ) , the film itself seems less than finished . It seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed , but whether or not it 's intentional is hard to say . The whole thing seems shabbily made and undone , especially the Orcs and the Nazgul . Another problem , of course , is the huge gaps in the plot . Bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie , and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours ( the new trilogy by Peter Jackson does it in about twice that time . ) Far too many important bits were left out ( and I do n't refer only to Tom Bombadil , which , I think , was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie . ) And of course , the ending , which is completely sudden and out of place . I 'm not even sure if Bakshi originally intended to end the film there , or if he even had any idea where he 's going to end it.<br /><br />The characters ... well , most of them were okay . The hobbits do n't look so bad ( except for the gay Sam . Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make Sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character ? ) If you 're a Tolkien fanatic ( like me ) , watch this movie ( though I 'm not too sure about buying it . What special features does the DVD version have , anyway ? ) But know in advance that you 're not going to watch a real ' Lord Of The Rings Movie ' but not much more than a historical curiosity , which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the Beatles carried on with their plan ( I actually think a psychedelic LOTR could have been quite cool . The idea was to cast George as Gandalf , Paul as Frodo , Ringo as Sam and John as Gollum . ) If you did n't read the book or did n't like it much or do n't like animation films or do n't want to see a half - finished movie ... stay away .
0 I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson 's trilogy came out , but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison . The pace of this movie is rushed , many important scenes from the book are left out , and there is little character development . The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over , which I found distracting . And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished . There are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch , and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter . Watch this one if you 're in a hurry and ca n't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy . But if you have n't read the book you 'll probably be confused , because there is a lot missing from this version . 4 out of 10 .
0 Watching this again recently , I found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen , even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure . By any objective measure this was a disaster , but I found it easy to imagination how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely - and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers . Unfortunately , thanks to Jackson , that will not be possible for a long time.<br /><br />Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all , then this story simply could n't be stuffed up . Fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film . There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did it , although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution . The way they tried to show the wraith world from Frodo 's point of view for example . Or the way that Galadriel showed Sam what was happening back home for another.<br /><br />Another thing I really appreciated in this version - the silent moments . There were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back - drop . Compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the Jackson films , and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched . Jackson 's films were full of their own importance , this was quieter and a lot more modest.<br /><br />Jackson and co hit this with more than US$ 270 million dollars in production costs , at least $ 90 million dollars more for marketing , a massive tax break from the NZ government , and also gained massive savings from filming in NZ not the USA . However , despite the marketing claims , the intention to be faithful was never there . This is well documented . Philippa Boyens said as much in an interview , when she said they deliberately did n't re - read the books before writing the script . Jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film " along the lines of " the lord of the rings , and that the one he really wanted to do was Return of the King , because it had a lot of battles but no character development.<br /><br />In contrast , this film tried to be more true . Of course a lot of things were wrong , the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything , and the pace was too fast . Naturally they cut a lot , and adapted other scenes , and for this they deserve credit . While Jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose , Bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway . There 's actually a curious similarity between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films near the beginning - in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way - although of course some of this could be coincidence.<br /><br />This was not a good film , but the potential was there . Bakshi said in an interview to the Onion AV club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice . His version did n't work , but he might have been right .
0 This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else I 've ever seen . Really , if you are a Tolkien fan , rent it just to laugh at it with your friends . I wo n't be the millionth person to rip apart its flaws ... all I will say is that the movie ( for me , anyway ) lost major points for turning my favorite character , Sam , into a bumbling idiot . Shame , shame ... 3/10
0 I watched Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings when I was half way through reading the Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />At this time the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DvD but I told myself that I will finish reading the Two Towers and Return of Kings before watching it ( as I thought it showed the whole of the trilogy).<br /><br />So when I did finish the trilogy I went and brought the DvD , which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish.<br /><br />I was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because I love the book and I am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film.<br /><br />None of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page , even my favourite character who is Gandalf did not seem interesting at all . < br /><br />The animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks ( they looked awful ) and Aragorn and Sam face.<br /><br />I do n't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending , but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film could n't of got any better . < br /><br />I just hope that nobody judges the books by this film.<br /><br />3/10
0 Bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie , and then slapped silly for this attempt . The animation was poor , the characters looked ridiculous , the music was overwhelmingly blaring , and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of Tolkien 's masterpiece . I can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when I first saw it . Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways , simply because of the medium , but this movie , regardless of the source of the story , is just plain pathetic . Bashki is capable of much more .
0 The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting . But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in his film " Jawab'(1985 ) too . The problem here is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action - thriller ( viz . Khakee ) or an emotions - rich heavy duty drama ( Viz . Damini ) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome . If we ignore two of his - Pukar ( 2000 ) and Lajja(2001 ) , this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value . Therefore this film comes as a surprise , as to what made this script sensitive director going for half - baked characterization of both of his protagonists - Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman . As the film is getting over , audience did n't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration . Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self - realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with his own family . The revelation of Don 's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in ' Khakee " worked so effectively with Aishwarya 's character . That is not all , there is more to it . The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don , operating from abroad looks quite illogical . His openly landing up at Mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable . Pitching a mediocre , newcomer actor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea . But nonetheless film has some plus points . Ashok Mehta 's fine camera - work , two good fight sequences ( co - ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal ) , some light well - acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half , Santoshi 's fast - paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character . But all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your Family !
0 After watching KHAKEE i felt i 'll get to watch another good film but sadly The film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer < br /><br />RKS spoke so highly about the film during promotions , saying the film has meat unlike films released that time , I wonder which films was he talking about < br /><br />The film is actually a typical Masala film with loads of comedy , romance , action everything jumbled < br /><br />The ease at which the kids kidnap the family , is one of the funniest parts ever , Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood 's family < br /><br />The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization < br /><br />RKS gives his weakest film till date , except some Bachchan scenes the film is a bore < br /><br />Music is boring < br /><br />Amitabh tries to give the role his all , he does his part well , though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar His dubbing too is n't matched properly at times < br /><br />Akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams < br /><br />Aryeman seems expressionless , tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes < br /><br />Bhumika emerges the best of the lot < br /><br />The rest are okay

0 Hello , can anybody hear me ? I do n't know why you came to this page , but if you 're a fellow viewer of this movie : join the fanclub ! This movie was so unbelievably bad I could n't stop laughing when I saw it . I think it 's a must see , it 's bad in a nice way . Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here . I 'm afraid it 's very hard to get a copy of this movie , but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made .
0 Two houses , one street , one phone booth , one car , a girl next door , a boy next door and a zombie . This list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie . All you need is some blue light , ambient music and ... done . Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy though ! < br /><br />I like to organize " bad movie evenings " from time to time . The concept is really simple : get some booze , get some film - loving friends , and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer . For such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best . Laughs guaranteed!<br /><br />The bizarre thing is , van Rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement . To be a witness to this you 'll have to listen to the DVD 's commentary track . Again : disbelieve and laughs guaranteed !
0 this is not just a bad film , it 's one of the worst films ever . it 's so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable . the acting , oh my god , the script , you got ta be kiddin ' . how can you imagine the writer coming up with things like : - a kid who makes fireworks in school , fireworks SO powerfull , that when someone gets hit by it , they fly a hundred yards backwards and explode . -a girl is trapped in the celler , the killer is trying to break open the door . she gets a drill , but the wire is n't long enough . she first makes an extension cord , oh the horror , and then , when she 's done , she drills through the door and drills through the head of the killer . WOW - and there are plenty more examples like that . oh yeah , and what happened to George Kennedy , he used to be great ( Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke )
0 I do n't know why I keep doing this to myself ! ! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances ... and then they smack you around the head with junk like this ! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the Dutch - speaking countries . It 's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise , clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween . The producers and writers aimed really high with this , but fell really low . Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here . It 's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it 's only showed on special occasions , like " the Night of Distaste " . For exactly 5 minutes , Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline ... then it changes into a lame and low - brain slash ' n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects . The acting of the entire cast is abominable , even though there are a few respected names involved . The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium . He 's a beloved singer , host of TV - shows and idol of many young girls . He never ever mentions this thing he starred in , though . Like everybody else in The Netherlands , he 's trying to convince himself Intensive Care never happened .
0 I thought " Intensive Care " was quite bad and very unintentionally funny . But at least not as bad as I thought it might be . Sometimes it 's somewhat suspenseful , but never a good shocker.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD < br /><br />The fun lies in ridiculous moments . But the all - time classic moment is this : Peter ( Koen Wauters ) is stabbed and beaten by the killer . He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway . Amy ( Nada van Nie ) kneels beside him and asks " Poor Peter , shall I get you a band - aid?".<br /><br />This movie was shot in Dutch and English . To spare costs , all license plates are USA , and the background in the news studio is a skyline of Manhattan . Very funny if you 're Dutch and watching the original version in Dutch .
0 Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter . In the early ninety 's he tried his hand on movies as well . But this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all . It also ended the acting career of dutch actress Nada van Nie who went on being a football - wife a TV presenter and program - maker . I actually did see this in an ( almost empty ) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters , Clouseau . I so regret spending money on it . It looks cheap , it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way . Some people think it 's so bad it 's funny . I am not one of them . I just found it an incredible waste of time and money .
0 " Intensive Care " by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made . This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations . A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner . The acting is abysmal , the action is slow and the climax is laughable . A famous surgeon has a car accident . He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage."Intensive Care " is clearly influenced by American slasher films including " Halloween " and " Friday the 13th " series . The killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid . Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look . You'll laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe me !
0 This infamous ending to Koen Wauters ' career came to my attention through the ' Night of Bad Taste ' . Judging by the comment index i was n't the first and i am not to be the last person in Western Europe to learn that this musician ( undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene , even the Dutch agree on that ) tried to be an actor . Whether he should have made the attempt or not can not be judged . < br /><br />In ' Intensive Care ' he 's quite likable , but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating . No one can blame him . It deserves its ranking in Verheyen 's Hall of Fame by all means & standards . The story of the Murderous Maniac Who is Supposed To Have Died In An Accident But Is Alive And Wrathful has been told dozens of times before , and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography.<br /><br / > IC contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses . The pace is dull . The tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score , for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody , followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders , which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them . The sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing . The couple from Amsterdamned could have made it work , though . While dealing with the couple subject : the whole subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work . A more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victims - to - be , who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse . I will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning , for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces . As a matter of fact , most of them do . The ones i recall where obvious for the genre : a pretty nurse and two cops . < br /><br />Hence , in a slasher , the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself . The ( anti- ) hero has to take out the villain , mostly through clever thinking , for former red berets do n't often get parts in these films ; they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer . Translated to the events , Wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress . < br /><br />No people , i am not finished . This is not how the story goes . Wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to " A Clockwork Orange " , so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains . Though this method ensures the killer 's death more than the usual rounds of 9 mm bullets , the doctor survives in order to enable IC to reach the 80 min mark.<br /><br />I should have made my point by now . Intensive Care is a bad movie , which can only be enjoyed by Bad Taste lovers , who can verify Verheyen 's catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it . For example , the ( unintended ) parody value of the doctor 's clown mask ( Halloween ) and the final confrontation in the park ( the chase at the end of Friday the 13th).<br /><br />However , let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give IC a little credit . George Kennedy is not one of them . All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor / French actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a stand - in . He could have played his Naked Gun part again , to end up as beef , but with a longer screen time . The finale may be one of them . I had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence . It is good for a laugh.<br /><br />Name one good truly point about Intensive Care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career . It makes me wonder how many editions of the Paris - Dakar race he has to abort before coming to his senses.<br /><br / >
0 Well , I 'll start by admitting I 'm not a John Ford fan . ( I watched " The Informer " only because I 'm trying to work my way through a list of the " greats . " ) So if you are , just move along , 'cause you 're not going to agree with me.<br /><br />What an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is ! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here ( it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution ) but , as usual , Ford is determined to bury it under over - acting and cheap sentiment . I suppose it 's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less - than - seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the " talkies " -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue . ( Of course , title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times . ) What dialogue there is usually has a " They 're always after me Lucky Charms ! " quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent . Of course , as bad as they are , the accents are helpful in reminding us we 're in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over . ( It feels as if , with an eagle eye , you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.)<br /><br />Techniques change . Tastes change . So I wo n't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day . But it 's not one of the classics that hold up --- more just " fair warning " about the kind of over - simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career .
0 I 've seen about 820 movies released between 1931 - 39 , and THE INFORMER is the worst major release I 've seen from that time span . Awful , despicable , unpleasant , unhappy , unredeemable saga of a complete Loser . Watch a 1934 B Western instead .
0 I will warn you here : I chose to believe those reviewers who said that this was n't an action film in the usual sense , rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alright.<br /><br />I am here to tell you that they were wrong . Completely wrong.<br /><br />Well , no , not completely ; it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick , they were right about that . But it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well.<br /><br />Tom Beringer was n't too bad , I suppose , no worse than usual ; but what possessed them to cast Billy Zane in this ? Was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers ? A way to made their film a guaranteed flop ? In that case , it worked.<br /><br />If they were actually aiming for success , then why not cast somebody who can act ? Oh , and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write . Ah , yes , and a director who knows how to direct.<br /><br />As someone who sat through this mess , actually believing it would shortly redeem itself , I can assure you it never did . Pity , it could 've been a good film .
0 Realistic movie , sure , except for the fact that the characters do n't look like to be scared . When Billy Zane tries to kill someone , he feels bad ... but he does n't look like to . That 's why I do n't like his performance in this movie . Tom Berenger is again playing a soldier . No good thrill , realistic sequences . Not always shooting , that is one great thing . Well filmed . I hate the helicopter sequence , cause only one terrorist kills almost the whole marine bunch ... I give it * * and a half out of * * * * *
0 Despite its interesting premise , ' Sniper ' is quite tedious . With a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying ; instead it plods along with little tension .
0 Not much to say on this one . A plot you can pretty much peg , in the first 10 minutes . Nothing overly wrong with this film , very little action for an action film . There was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally . Whether an action film is the right genre to do that with , I 'm still undecided . Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to , as it had little twists and a straightforward plot . I was probably guilty of that , so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better.<br /><br />4/10 ( but the best of my 4 out of 10 's )
0 Eleven " great " filmmakers , eleven pieces of garbage . Eleven minutes each of sheer tedium , sophistry , condescension , self - indulgence . Treats for people of all nations . Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a " hip hip hooray ! " for terorism in his amateurish segment . Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel , using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster . Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera . Sean Penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9 - 11 . Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing . Claude Lelouch focussing on a trivial and cliched love affair . Ken Loach of the UK focussing on Chile . Etc . etc .
0 First of all , I ai n't American or Middle - Eastern . Second of all , I do n't have a religion . The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies . Henceforth , I believe I would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias.<br /><br />Most of these short films are an utter disgrace . This dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by " some " barbaric and uncivilized morons . Instead , most of what I saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points . Examples:<br /><br />1 ) Ken Loach 's segment . Sure , we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001 ? Two wrongs do n't make a right ? ! Whatever ! This film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent Chilean - English accent.<br /><br />2 ) Most disturbing is Youssef Chahine 's segment . It is obvious that he has trouble with logic . He justified the murders due to - America being a democracy and because some Americans voted the politicians in power , then all Americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the Middle - East . Helloooo ! Is this guy for real ? ? Some Americans do n't even vote ! Some Americans do n't even know where the Middle - East is ; some do n't even know what religion is practiced there ; and majority do n't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes . # # # Mr Chahine , the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic . The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world . The murdered firefighters , rescuers , office workers , by - standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics . And yet , we are not allowed to go about our lives because " some " people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion . We are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.<br /><br />3 ) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims . Another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda . Sometimes , it is not about you . Some people always think about the " me , me , me . " Sometimes , it is about other people.<br /><br />4 ) Idrissa Ouedraogo 's segment is a joke and another political point scorer . They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty . Blah , blah , blah.<br /><br />This movie denigrates the memory of " Sept. 11th , 2001 " victims.<br /><br />The best thing for it is the TRASH CAN .
0 I have never panned a film on - line , but I felt moved to do so , after seeing this one . One does n't show up at someone 's funeral and say to the bereaved , " My relatives died , so why should I care about yours?" < br /><br />Minus the propaganda , there was little , if anything , that could be called " art . " As the daughter of deaf parents , I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick . Any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated , not ignored it.<br /><br />The word " chutzpah " comes to mind . As a writer , there are few subjects I would stay away from : the Holocaust is one ; this is another . I wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant ( and inept ) .
0 I 've found the movie offensive for Americans which lost somebody in the towers , for American people in general . Pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years , each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts ( which have none to do with a terrorist attack ) , or criticize American 's political behaviour , or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of September 11 . Shame on them .
0 Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so , this is your movie . This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd . That would be ok , but the story was poorly executed . Contrived plot twists , poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound . This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being . Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line - the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out . ( This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint ) . Later the same hotel employee is somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city , mind you , I ve been there- and testifies against the girls , as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison . C'mon . Rent Another Day in Paradise instead .
0 I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time , after seeing " Return to Paradise , " which I found to be gritty . I was so disappointed . The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which I think was partly stolen from " Return to Paradise . " < br /><br />Maybe I was expecting too much . < br /><br />On the positive side Danes , Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles . Although I did nt like Danes 's character and first and found her very annoying . < br /><br />I could nt see anything realistic about the film . It could of been done so much better , for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror . It was too cheery a movie to be realistic . There could also of been more action and tension < br /><br />The best thing about this film is the " tragic " ending . I could nt of predicted that . But by that time I really did nt care what happened to them.<br /><br />3/10
0 A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting , but where the hell is the ending to this film?<br /><br />In fact , what is the point of it?<br /><br />The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally , and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline.<br /><br />The performances of the cast are questionable , if not believable.<br /><br />Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film ? I guess we have to wait for the sequel.<br /><br / >
0 Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would ever like to see . I also did not like the movie when some Aussie man smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling . I would not go to that country no matter what after I saw this movie . In fact this movie stinks . I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women . Germany is the country I tolerate . I also would rather stick to the United States instead . After I saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling , I left the theatre and had my money refunded because I can not tolerate this movie . If you are going to to Thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler , forget this !
0 ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Russian fantasy " actioner " ( and I use the term loosely ) that I 've been trying to watch for over a year . I 've finally gotten to the end and now I wish I did n't put in the repeated effort.<br /><br />In an effort to save two hours of your life I 'm going to tell you he plot- a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom . Things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend . He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home . The guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well.<br /><br />Very little is said . no explanation is really given for anything ( like why they lock i d girlfriend in an asylum ) and the action , for the most part is all off screen . The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intense and not saying anything , killing people ( off screen - most of the action happens off screen ) . It looks good , is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film . Hell , I would have liked some sense of real character development or back story ( all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid ) . The movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six . If they were n't going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast . No instead we get the hero on a boat . The hero in a bus , the hero walking , the hero looking disturbed . Hero with his girl . It really annoyed me since I think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give instructions to " get this guy".<br /><br />4 out of 10 . Its about four hours ( all my attempts to see this ) I 'll never get back . Only for those who want to see a brooding Russian action film with very little action
0 Nothing positive to say . Meandering nonsense , huffing and puffing with a " message " . New Russian ( post - Soviet ) films can be very good ( Cuckoo comes to mind ) , yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos ( Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example ) . This is a " dozor " type of emptiness . Acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors . Special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky ( would someone please realize that Blair Witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame ? ) and takes are geared towards attention - deficit pre - teens who subside on CounterStrike and masturbation . The female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often , male antihero need a diction coach ( although genetics are n't bad : rather expressive eyes . ) One ( middle ) finger for this irrelevant pile of non - art . Anyone who reviews this positively better be a ( distant ) cousin of the " auteurs " .
0 It 's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones , the humor 's cheesy , and so is the acting . But after all it is a soft core movie , which is expected and does n't matter because what you really want is the sex . Which gets me to the biggest problem of all , there barely is any of it . Which makes you feel like you 're watching TV at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid that 's going nowhere in that industry . You 're left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene , a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen , then just left hanging . The one(maybe two , or one with two parts)that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though . I personally ca n't recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two . If you lucking for a good movie with a plot and good acting , you do n't want this . If you looking for a good soft core lesbian film , you do n't want this either .
0 * * Possible Spoilers**<br /><br />This straight - to - video mess combines a gun - toting heroine , grade - Z effects , nazis , a mummy and endless lesbian footage and it 's still boring ; the video 's 45 minute running time only SEEMS like Eternity . The only good part is one of the blooper outtakes , wherein the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptologist into a chair -- and one villain 's foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg . Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf , bowling or tennis instead .
0 This movie is not for the faint or weak of heart . It could n't decide if it was going to be porn or legit . It was neither one . It was just bad . There was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again .
0 Someone had a great idea : let 's have Misty Mundae do her own , R - rated version of Lara Croft - firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits , but topless as well . It WAS indeed a great idea . The problem is that the people who had it could n't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it . Therefore , we get a " film " that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts ( often in slow - motion ) , and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage . The appeal of Misty Mundae is still evident : she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl - next - door beauty . However her two female co - stars here , with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene , are nowhere near her league . If " Mummy Raider " was presented as a Youtube video , I 'd rate it higher , but as a " film " destined for DVD consumption it can not get more than 1/2 a * out of 4 .
0 Not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short , this thing exists for one reason , to have a lesbian three - way . There are worse reasons to exist . One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie . Misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character , like Lara Croft , that they make nude calenders of her , you know that a soft - core flick is set to explode . Unfortunately , this is pretty pathetic . Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty , where you can see her hand is fingering air . Watch this if you just ca n't get enough of Misty or Ruby , who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever .
0 I ca n't say I 'm all that experienced in misty Mundae flicks having seen only a handful , but it 's obvious that this was made on a shoestring , and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a Tomb Raider rip - off inside a garage , it is n't because it 's completely obvious that this is what they were doing . The film only runs for forty five minutes , and this is definitely a good thing as there is n't nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer . It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist ( who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever could ) , a mummy , which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and Misty - this film 's version of Tomb Raider , who keeps her top on for much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version . I have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings , this film could have been better . It 's got Misty Mundae for a start , and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter Darian Caine . The pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a Seduction Cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot , although that is n't really a bad thing . Obviously , this is a rubbish film - but the fact that it 's short is to its credit , and if you 're after a bit of lesbian sex , you could do worse .
0 * * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br /><br />The titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father ( an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next ) from a moth - eaten , dime - store mummy and nasty Nazis out to -- what else ?-- build a Fourth Reich . Misty 's costume , like those of some other wimmen , gets skimpier as the movie rolls on . The last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action ; this footage actually gets real boring , real fast , which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it . MISTY gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast , then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft - core sex . This makes MUMMY RAIDER a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden , David F. Friedman and Harry Novak . Just think : if this wonder - work had been cranked out four decades ago , it would have played for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK . As it is , MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video . Grab yours , quick , before it goes out of print .
0 There is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters . A bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue . I 've just seen this on TV and I did n't think it was a ' film ' as such , more a post-'This Life ' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it . Stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately , irrelevant middle class " lifestyle " crap that takes itself far too seriously . It 's got David Baddiel in it and that bird out of " Cold Feet " , you know what to expect . There was a lot of this stuff about in 2000 , it was a particularly British malaise ... "they're educated and doing drugs ? friends , but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships ? sounds great ! " . This kind of nonsense , and post - Guy Ritchie comedy- gangster stuff ... dark days . If you have taste , this will annoy you to the point of violence .
0 I 'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film . But I ca n't understand how this one got made . Who made it ? How could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film ? Did they do a weekend course at some film school , get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap David Badiel 's family one by one until he agreed to be in it ? Or was he by any chance a longtime family friend / distant relation doing this out of sheer , misplaced kindness ? I do n't care , do n't want to know . Even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it , mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera . Meanwhile the DOP must have been the gaffer from Neighbours , there seemed to be absolutely no sound design , the script , the direction and editing were all abysmal , and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that I ca n't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film .
0 do not be suckered into renting this movie . It has nothing to do with an escape from death row , despite the ( english ) title . I ca n't think of a single good thing to say about the movie . Poor acting , poor editing , poor directing ... laughable " plot " , and the sound / music was so irritating , it 's a wonder this movie does n't come with a warning label . The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for it 's historical cheesiness quality . They just do n't make films this bad anymore .
0 Kalifornia is disturbing . I believe there is no reason for this story to be told . It is neither entertaining nor does it have social value . Technically , the movie is very well make , the performances are top rate and first class . The story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest . But at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency . I recommend Kalifornia to no one .
0 honestly , if anyone has a brain , there 's not 1 positive thing < br /><br />to say about this movie what so ever . < br /><br />I lost my $ 1 renting this . I 'd rather laugh at Will Smith saying " If you got a dream , you got to protect it " . < br /><br />all the actors must 've been bored or had no fame at the time . even Matthew Mc Conahay * however you spell it * was better then all the actors in this movie , when he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4 . If you see this movie , and have anything good to say , you IQ , must be extremely low , with such bad taste in movies , it hurts . Thank YOU ... and the TRUTH , has been spoken!<br /><br />Save yourself from the misery . < br /><br />Get Devil 's Rejects , now that 's a classic .
0 I was expecting to love this movie -- film noir , serial killer , dark irony . I was baffled by many choices the characters made ( " Hey , I know they 're creepy looking , but let 's hook up for a cross - country road trip anyway ! " ) , found the pacing to be glacial , and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer.<br /><br />Thinking about it now , this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense - o - meter ( 1992 model ) before starting to film ...
0 Distasteful , cliched thriller has young couple doing cross - country research on America 's most infamous murder sites , becoming road partners with a dim - witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend -- who is an actual psycho . Arty and alienating , the film 's tone alternates between pouty pseudo - irony and silly flamboyance . Handsomely - made perhaps , but ultimately laughable . Brad Pitt 's performance as the low - rent killer is godawful . * from * * * *
0 In an interview , David Duchovny said he has n't been able to watch even the first hour of this film - and neither should you . The scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around - change the name he gives and he could had lifted his performance from just about any episode of the X - Files . He 's on autopilot for the whole film . Brad Pitt overacts appallingly .
0 Another movie to suffer without an adventure to run , no enigma to solve . Just an illness man , acting like an animal . No a good reason to take this journey . Pitt and Lewis are great actors ; magnificent Michelle Forbes but a weak David Duchovny performance ...
0 German nut case Jörg Buttgereit apparently has fans - but I do n't know why , and I 'm Definitely not one of them ! The only Buttgereit film I 'd seen previously was Nekromantik and I hated every minute of it , but - shockingly - this film is worse ! Der Todesking is pointless in the same way as Nekromantik , but it 's a worse film because it 's boring in a way that few movies have ever managed ( it 's not far off The Blair Witch Project , seriously ) . Some people say that this film is ' sick ' and ' shocking ' , but it really is n't . The director may have been making a point about death , but only he knows what it is . How anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me . The film revolves around the theme of suicide , and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week . Yes , that means we have a pointless and boring episode for Monday , a pointless and boring episode for Tuesday , a pointless and boring episode for Wednesday etc etc . This film manages to be even more boring than my average week ! < br /><br />Der Todesking is apparently an ' art ' film , although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to ' art ' . Each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story - but it does n't ! We just get a quick little sketch on suicide , and it only makes you wonder what the point is . The film feels like it should be deep , but there 's a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it . Buttgereit uses a few evocative images ; but I 'm unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just is n't that memorable . There 's a shot involving a decomposing man 's body that features fairly often , but that gets old pretty quick and all you 're left with is the rest of the film , which is unfortunate . If I were to struggle for good things to say about this crap , all I can think of is this ; the title sounds cool . As I mentioned , Nekromantik is the only other film I 've seen from this amateur director ; I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2 , and now I 'm really in no rush to watch either . Der Todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it ' art ' is very much mistaken . Give it a miss .
0 The subject notwithstanding , this is an amateur , exhibitionist movie -- or an effort at one -- which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student 's composition book full of death " poetry " . To be sure , it will disturb viewers who are hell - bent on being disturbed , but the success will be attributable to themselves , not to the director . To genuinely get under somebody 's skin requires sensibility , discipline , technique , and talent , as well as an eye and an ear . The film does contain one evocative image , shown as a still ( and also used on the video case ) , but with no development leading up to or away from it . If the director had had an eye , he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie -- that is , a movie .
0 I 'm sorry but this is just awful . I have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost do n't believe me . There is nothing wrong with the idea , modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything . When the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say " Hey my watch has stopped " ? Imagine lines like that being repeated 15 + times before they say anything else and you have the movie 's lack of greatness in a nutshell .
0 Watching CBS 's " Surrender , Dorothy " , I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it ( not because it 's a television movie -- with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses , it is n't any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV -- but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine ) . A single mother , grieving the sudden death of her twenty - something daughter , imposes upon -- and gradually becomes friends with -- the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident . Adapted from the novel , this teleplay gives us a group of self - absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid . Aside from being coarse and dim , these phony people are incredibly unconvincing , as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside ( one young man , who wears muscle shirts to tell us he 's gay , hears Diane Keaton say , " Surrender , Dorothy " and actually asks , " That 's from " The Wizard of Oz " , right?" ... no , genius , it 's from " Citizen Kane " ! ) . Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death . She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage ( lots of kooky outfits ) , but it does n't sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way . Here , she 's a crazed harpy who does n't learn many lessons on her journey of self - discovery ( the movie quickly forgets it 's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom , who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her ) . This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat , " It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there " . I ca n't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer , muddled and baffling . It 's deranged .
0 I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation . Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie , " The Christmas Box " based on the book by Richard Paul Evans . I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show , hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my " new " life . After seeing this movie I was so disappointed . As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain , I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who " think " they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child . This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child . It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop . I had a few calls after the movie , each call the same , " That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back " What a bunch of bull ! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark . I guess that 's Hollywood .
0 ( Very light spoilers , maybe . ) < br /><br />Normally a fan of Diane Keaton , I tried to watch this tonight . I had to switch it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother . Both came across as self - absorbed with little regard for others , with the daughter also adding in rude , disrespectful and reckless to the mix . When the daughter died , the only thing I thought was , " At least we wo n't have to watch her anymore . " Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving , but it was too far gone for me by then . I simply was n't enjoying it , so I stopped watching . If you want me to care for the protagonist , you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner -- if it 's nearly an hour in and I do n't care , it 's too late.<br /><br />The supporting cast was sincere and well played -- I felt for * them!*--and the gay best friend was wonderful , but even combined , that was n't enough to carry the film for me .
0 * * 1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce.<br /><br />Someone should tell Ms. Keaton , enough with your Annie Hall philosophy and hats.<br /><br />This flick is just too much as Keaton 's daughter , Sara , dies in a traffic accident , while her boyfriend survives.<br /><br />Keaton , who could not be reached by phone at first , as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug , grieves in a new way for grievers.<br /><br />She retreats to the summer locale where all of Sara 's friends are staying . She cleans the house , sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed . It appears that sweet Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter . In addition , she had an abortion thanks to this guy . We 're all now put on this guilt trip.<br /><br />Her only hope is to find the elusive diary that Sara kept . She also hopes that boyfriend , Adam , who is a playwright , will not include all this in another play.<br /><br />When the diary is found , it has been written in Japanese . Sara had a Ph . D in this language . It 's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a Japanese cook in a Japanese restaurant.<br /><br />Naturally , everything seems to tie up nicely in the end . < br /><br />The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz . Every time mom and Sara would speak , they would both utter Surrender Dorothy.<br /><br />As if this is n't enough , during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning , Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen in his film , Interiors , where he tried to successfully emulate Ingmar Bergman . Ms. Keaton also tries drugs with the group . Come on , folks , can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this ? < br /><br />Fair to mediocre best sums up this film .
0 Although the casting for this film was admirable , particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott , the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching.<br /><br />My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck , and it was almost impossible to turn away . It may have been that we " hoped " that the message would eventually make itself apparent , and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort . Unfortunately , this did not happen.<br /><br />Of course the audience may have been able to " make sense " of this convoluted tale , a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd . The writers , however , did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning.<br /><br />It was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts , and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non - existent.<br /><br />Unfortunately , made - for - TV movies have seemed to devolve over the years . Whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past , present - day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience , concentrating primarily on manipulating us to " stay - tuned " through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as Surrender , Dorothy are made .
0 I could not believe how awful this film was ; I rarely watch commercial TV , but thought " Well , Diane Keaton is always worth watching " . I stand corrected . Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age , but the script to this was so inept , clichéd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow 's ear . None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable . The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open - mouthed horror through most of this wondering " What were they thinking ? " . Very , very sad that it has come to this . Do n't waste your time .
0 I ca n't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and I feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs . When one of the main characters announces that he 's gay twice in the first five minutes , do n't ignore it as typical PC nonsense and figure it has to get better because it wo n't . If his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him does n't make you sick , then be thankful the freak who wrote and/or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint . I mean , get real . It 's one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick 's supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of " closure " over the sudden death of her daughter . What does one thing have to do with the other , one might be tempted to ask ? Apparently , the two issues are inextricably interwoven . And if that were n't bad enough , there 's the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor . I mean , seriously , has n't that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis ? Why must she go around like that ? At the very least , how about shaving the ugly thing off , and while you 're at it , have those horrible moles removed , too . Would YOU slurp up some ice cream she just served you ? I think not . It must be a New Jersey thing . < br /><br />You'd think Diane Keaton might save this piece of drek , but think again . Was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse ? I do n't even wanna think about it . So what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter . This grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that 's all there is to it . One wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going . None of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant . Trust me -- pass this piece of crap up . It 's not about death , a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter , or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it . It 's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director .
0 The first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on ( unless you read the book - which I had not).<br /><br />If you can stick with the first half , the second half is sweet - predictable , yes , but sweet none - the - less.<br /><br />The way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80 's , not 2005.<br /><br />No stand - out moments , bland , but it moved along without boring me.<br /><br />I would like to know why Keaton selected this role , her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance .
0 As I sat subjected to this televised mediocrity , I wondered why ? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this trash ? The movie uses meaningless , contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands . The movie takes a political agenda to a new level . The movie was meaningless , and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype . < br /><br />It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile , but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you can not polish a turd . I hope that you did not waste your New Year 's Day watching another mindless made for TV movie . I now know why the networks started airing series on Sunday night , to rid us of trash !
0 My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation . It looked warm and touching . It started out well ; but , soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while . It got so bad that we turned it off The movie was poorly acted and honesty , we could n't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman ! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning . I would have had her committed . And , of course , like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood we have to throw it a token " gay " character ! This movie was boring . I was expecting more from Diane Keaton !
0 I just finished reading a book on Anita Loos ' work and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great ( impressive wings ) , so I thought I 'd watch this movie . I 'd never heard of the film before , so I had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever . Thought it got off to a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he does n't know exists . The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that wo n't stay on was really endearing . I was even with the film when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel . But after a while it just started to fall apart for me . Eddy stays " asleep " for the entire rest of movie , so it 's all a dream . Whatever happens from there on does n't really matter , because he 's just dreaming . The rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless . I had to force myself to stick with it . And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky.<br /><br />Had Eddy " woken " a sooner and the original story continued , or had he really married an angel , I think it would have been a lot more interesting . I wanted to see more of her real character.<br /><br />There were n't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical . The first few songs were good , but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard . Completely wrong for her operatic voice . Even so , Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine , showing what true stars they were .
0 I 'll say one thing for Jeanette and Nelson -- even when stranded in a mirthless , witless , painfully inept musical like this , there 's still that twinkle in their eyes . Yes , the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin . Even when the score is practically a throwaway , non - existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes . And even when the circumstances are so unbelievable -- yes , even for a fantasy.<br /><br />Truth to tell , she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real - life husband Gene Raymond in SMILIN ' THROUGH , which , nonetheless , was a considerably better film.<br /><br />Sorry , I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan , but this is the bottom of the heap . Jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one " hep " number with Binnie Barnes -- and Nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations.<br /><br />One can only wonder what this was like on Broadway in 1938 . Surely , it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak MGM production . Edward Everett Horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess . It 's like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting cast.<br /><br />Summing up : Painfully clumsy rendering of a Rodgers and Hart musical . Ca n't recommend it , even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy . And even if Jeanette 's close - ups still glow with her gossamer beauty , this film is jaw - droppingly bad .
0 When anyone comes into a film of this type of film it 's not without saying that an overdose of that great over - the - counter brain - medicine , Suspension of Disbelief , comes in mighty handy.<br /><br />Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles : Anna / Brigitta , the woman who Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time , but who also is -- an angel sent to Earth.<br /><br />My reaction when I saw this was a mute gasp of " Hunh ? " Where have I seen this before ? It turns out , I have seen it before , but in a movie made much later than this one . DATE WITH AN ANGEL , a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987 , cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Beart who had no speaking lines , also wore a blond wig , and made life hell for soap - actor Michael Knight . Much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra - low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey.<br /><br />Anyway , not to elaborate , this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy , neither very good actors but terrific singers , would be together playing up the " innocence " and " clean - cut " romance that they were known for . After that you may need a cold shower , not because there are any steamy scenes here , but to get rid of the memory .
0 The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire . The script is weak and has been presented badly . The film just has no life in it . Eddy and MacDonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final pairing . There 's nothing wrong with their singing , its just everything else in this turkey that s overcooked .
0 The Sentinel represents everything about the soul - lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days . I can not possibly think of one good thing about it , it 's all so generic , so factory - made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting , undeserving public.<br /><br />A plot about a Secret Service Agent planning to assassinate the Prez could well be entertaining . If handled by a good director or caring cast that is . Douglas is the one who is framed . Basinger is the First Lady , with whom he is having an affair ( an undeveloped , unresolved plot contrivance ) . Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he did n't . And Longoria is nothing . A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and ... that 's it . I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service . As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool , a token and is very badly written.<br /><br />Clark Johnson 's , he who gave us the equally as pathetic SWAT back in 2003 , mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV - movie . Douglas , Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone - in their performances from afar . Eva Longoria , the most over - exposed woman of the 21st Century , is basically only in this to attract to the Desperate Housewives audience . Her role is 100 % pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development . She barely has 2 lines to rub together . A truly shameless marketing ploy.<br /><br />If you 're a glutton for punishment then do n't let me stop you . But it IS time and money you wo n't be getting back .
0 This , for lack of a better term , movie is lousy . Where do I start ...... <br /><br />Cinemaphotography - This was , perhaps , the worst I 've seen this year . It looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man . Maybe they only had one camera . It gives you the sensation of being a volleyball.<br /><br />There are a bunch of scenes , haphazardly , thrown in with no continuity at all . When they did the ' split screen ' , it was absurd . Everything was squished flat , it looked ridiculous.<br /><br />The color tones were way off . These people need to learn how to balance a camera . This ' movie ' is poorly made , and poorly done.<br /><br />The plot - You got to be kidding . If I was an SS agent , I 'd sue the producers . looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and guns . Sutherland was in his ' 24 ' mode - I can see this for free . Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less on , and a lot more showing . As an action bimbo she was n't much.<br /><br />I could n't see a real plot , other than Douglas boinking the Presidents wife . Never did say why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres . I just do n't see the President of the United States running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building , like a rat in a maze . p - l - e - a - s - e.<br /><br />Hollywood is dead . This movie is the proof . I like ' the big screen ' . Have since I was a kid . Many more ' movies ' like this and I 'll quit going . What s the matter Hollywood , made so many chick flicks , forget how to make a real movie ? If I owned a theater , I 'd start running the old movies . The one with real actors , good story lines - and good Cinemaphotography.<br /><br />This ' movie ' is a dog . Do n't waste your time or money on it . I rate this ' movie ' a zero ! Douglas is n't suited for this role . I can over look his age , but his just is to much of a wimp to carry this off .
0 Slow , Slow , Slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film . If you do n't figure out who the " mole " is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead . The secret service must have been too , because it took them the whole film to put it together . There are no compelling characters in the movie ( not film ) . The pace of the movie is slow there is no tension . The hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at Michael Douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass . The funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending . It is laugh out loud ridiculous . At least six people got up and left the movie early . I would have joined them if I were not sitting in the middle of the row . I would not recommend this film to anyone .
0 Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible . It carries no semblance of a genuine human story , dead and dull . It is a parody of Hollywood , with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a Denzel Washington movie , wobbly camera shots and focusing , racist stereotypes , absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses . It is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names . The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it . I feel like an idiot for watching this , save yourself .
0 Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult . The problems are many . The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison , a Secret Service agent who " took one " for Reagan during the attempt on his life . Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family , mainly as a guard for the First Lady ( Kim Basinger , L.A. CONFIDENTIAL ) . Troubles arise as we see Pete 's close involvement with the First Lady , and a sudden threat against the President himself ( David Rasche , UNITED 93 ) . When Pete fails a polygraph test , he 's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge ( Kiefer Sutherland , 24 TV series).<br /><br />As the presidential assassination plot unfolds , Pete finds himself on the run from his own people . His only confidant is the First Lady , and she 's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another ( which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place ) . But is Pete really innocent ? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President ? If he is innocent , how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service ? < br /><br />The one , big , overwhelming problem with this film is that there 's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat . Is n't that what the movie 's supposed to be about ? One would think so ! But the audience is never let in on why the assassin(s ) want to kill the Prez . Hmm . Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere ? < br /><br />And what 's with David Breckinridge 's ( Kiefer 's ) new partner , Jill Marin ( Eva Longoria , CARLITA 'S WAY ) ? Seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a$$-candy . What was her purpose again ? Did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low - cut blouse?<br /><br />There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel as to be laughable . The action is too easily stymied by the " What the ... ? " responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie .
0 Lets first start this review with the fact that I SIGNED UP JUST TO WRITE THE REVIEW AND WARN PEOPLE TO SAVE Their MONEY!!<br /><br />This was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since The Hulk . The storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with . If you are expecting 24 but on the big screen , flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket .. You may get more enjoyment that way . The acting was terrible , the plot was completely unrealistic , ( along with the so called " twist " in the end . I must say this .. The ending did surprise me . I am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me , but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie . They rushed the ending so quickly that I did n't even realize that it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if I could just figure out how to get into that screening room.<br /><br />Casting was awful for a few reasons . First of all , they must have accidentally switched the character assignments , because Michael Douglas played the roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have been playing . While Douglas was sneaking around agents , tapping phone lines , hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him , Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things are n't going that badly for him . He plays a very bland agent , nothing like his Jack Bauer type roll us 24 fans love.<br /><br />I can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas . It can be best compared to a remake of the " The Fugitive " / " In The Line of Fire " but written by people with mental disabilities
0 There is good . There is bad . And then their is The Sentinel , a bottom - barrel political " thriller " that ranks among the worst movies I have ever seen . The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is a good one , but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered . Directed with ham - handed " edginess " by Clark Johnson , every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot . Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here . I can honestly say I have NEVER , in all my life , viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes . The twist is predictable from square one , and the character 's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience . Avoid this at all costs . This is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value .
0 Seriously , I do n't even know where to begin . It 's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third - grader and said ' make me a movie about the secret service ' . The editing is ridiculous , the cinematography was random at best , every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well , was there even a director there ? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless ... and random .... and lame.<br /><br />Here 's a SPOILER for you ; this movie is the dumbest thing you 'll ever see . < br /><br />However , if you liked this piece , you 'll also enjoy ; Deterrance , Dark Blue , and a partial frontal lobotomy .
0 I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening , and despite the fact that I did n't pay a dime to see this film I still felt ripped off . Ladies and gentlemen , time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a Benjamin on your seat . The acting is torpid at best ; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of Jack Bauer , and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving Catherine Zeta - Jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey . Eva Longoria is a non - entity ; she looks like she 's reading her lines off a teleprompter . And if you ca n't spot the " mole " within the first 20 minutes , then you just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recycled story lines . If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller , rent In the Line of Fire . If you see and buy into this one , you 'll start to fear for the president 's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown - up versions of the kinds from 90210 . No matter what your feelings about W , let 's hope this " art " does not imitate life .
0 I 've been willing to put up with a lot from late - spring / summer action fluff movies , but in general that 's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff ( i.e. cool special effects , interesting plot twists , comic value , Steve Buscemi , etc . ) . This movie , however , had none of this . All that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria 's cleavage ( an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket ) . There is an embarrassing lack of plot , suspense , back story , character development , continuity , etc . I would get into specifics , but quite frankly I 've already - maybe willingly - forgotten most of the movie.<br /><br />The entire time I was in the theater , I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD . Save your money on this one , folks . Unless you really , really , really like Eva Longoria 's cleavage .
0 Not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller " The Sentinel " . The Sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me , not delivering the consistent action , a couple of critics promised on the back . To me it seemed like everyone was Halfassing it , and only there to make some quick cash , because this felt very much like a made for TV film . The Sentinel is a rehash of several better films , like " In The Line Of Fire " this does not have any originality in it , and watching Michael Douglas run around , felt kinda silly in my opinion . The Main problem besides it 's unoriginality , had to be the poor pace . I often got distracted while trying to view this movie , while looking how much run time was left , more then once . Not only the miscasting with Eva Longoria , who could n't convince worth a lick.<br /><br />Performances . Michael Douglas is usually a dependable actor , here is obviously going through the motions . He does not convince as a man on a run , or a secret agent . His chemistry with Bassinger , was also off . I 'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland , but here he is only OK , nothing more then that . He tries to come across as a gruff , but managed to be more bland then anything else , and to be honest , he did n't seem that interested . Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre . She does not convince in her role , and was pure eye candy . Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady . She looks bored to tears , and her role is a throw away , more then anything else . Martin Donovan has a big part in the end , but not enough to matter for me.<br /><br />Bottom line . The Sentinel is yet , another political thriller , that bored me to tears . It 's too old , too tired , and most importantly the lack of effort sucked . Not recommended.<br /><br />4/10
0 I saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and I excited . It looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990 's . It recalled me also Fugitive movies , a cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland . However , The Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time . As I see , many people say that this is like a TV movie . Not exactly . Firstly , there are much more better TV movies in this genre . Secondly , TV movies might be very fun sometimes , but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time . It is not stylish at all visually and the most important , the tone of the movie is unappealing . This is not an action movie , there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash . Also they are not big action scenes , but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie . The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary . Besides , the assassination plot to the president is the most cliché story in this genre either , but they insist on that . And this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be . Although , Douglas is very old now , he has still potential for acting in an action thriller . In the film , Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones , for example . Sutherland is a wrong choice either , because you feel as if you watch Jack Bauer and somehow , its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a TV movie , Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice , of course she is too passive or straight in this movie , because she is a soap opera actress . The movie was not fun even one second to me , so I could not get over for a while .
0 It saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors , locations and genres , i.e. Douglas , Sutherland , Washington , D.C. and political thriller , but ' The Sentinel ' really hits a low . It 's like they had a great idea up front , signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest . And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger ( not only do I feel she 's one of the worst actors in Hollywood , but I 'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one , and definitely the only bad actor in the film , to win an acting Oscar for ' L.A. Confidential . ' ) But she was n't the only problem . Sutherland , who I love as Jack Bauer on ' 24 ' once again plays  Jack . I miss his old ' A Time to Kill ' or ' A Few Good Men ' days . Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in . Plot : Someone , some Secret Service traitor , wants the President dead and Douglas is ( haphazardly ) being framed . Will someone believe him ? Actually , no spoiler here : as quickly as they came up with that subplot half - way through , it 's over before you know it . And why did someone(s ) want the President dead ? Is that to be revealed in the sequel ? Too many plot holes , too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable ' The Sentinel ' is . If you only see one movie a year , you may not know who the mole is , but anyone who 's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one ' Law & Order ' episode you 'll know in the first few frames . Was it terrible ? Not really , the cinematography was good , and despite Sutherland playing Jack again , he 's still got it .
0 A bum gives a Secret Serviceman a tip about a Secret Service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president . Baloney . How did the bum know ? The script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the Secret Service works , but who cares . Most of this just slows down the movie . All the chases that follow are this film 's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies . Then , after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out - guns all his buddies , we have a shootout in the Toronto City Hall . The Canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs , but how did they get into this ? Finally , all is worked out . But it still makes no sense .
0 SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! Personally I do n't understand why Pete did not help to save Williams life , I mean that would be great to know why William was motivated , or forced . I think Secret Service members are every day people , and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the Secret Service , now he 's motivations are clear , well known . But as a rental this film will not satisfy you , cause the old but used twists , the average acting -these are just things in this film , only for keep you wait the end . Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did a far better work like this time , and I still wondering how the producers ( for example Michael Douglas)left this film to theaters .
0 Hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no thought required . There are the requisite explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies . A pretty good cast with Donald Sutherland , John Lithgow , and the lovely Tia Carrere . This cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one .. on a scale of one to ten .. a 4
0 The director Sidney J. Furie has created in Hollow Point a post - modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience . < br /><br />Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of ' plot ' and ' characterisation ' when you remove the crutches of ' motivation ' and ' reason ' . < br /><br />The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher.<br /><br />One and a half stars.<br /><br />P.S. Nothing in this movie makes any sense , the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane .
0 This bomb is just one ' explosion ' after another , with no humor and only absurd situations . Really , pyrotechnics to the extreme . Reality is not one of its strong points . I give it a 1 out of 10 . I would have made it a zero but that option was n't permitted . Sorry , but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles . But then at times we all need to have money . And I still recoil at that Tim Burton farce about Mars . Nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey . But if that was a turkey , this movie then is not even a gizzard . I wish I could say , " give me back my money " . You can bet I would if I could . But that is the trouble with premium services , the subscription variety .
0 I saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals , where we would set out to rent a bunch of B - movies and vote for who picked the worst.<br /><br />The night we watched this , it was voted the best , due to semblance of plot and fun costuming.<br /><br />This is certainly a silly , kitschy , movie , to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low - budget fluff . Personally , however , I would n't recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it 's own mark on you.<br /><br />It made enough of an impression on me that I 've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years.<br /><br />A good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies . This one is fun , and I remember bouncy music ...
0 This film is horribly acted , written , directed and produced . But it 's so campy it 's actually semi - watchable . That 's SEMI watchable.<br /><br />The storyline ( what little there is ) makes virtually no sense whatsoever . The Barney Drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds . < br /><br />Many of the Canadian supporting cast can be found in TV commercials .. None of them went on to anything else that I 'm aware of . And of course Sly Stallone 's even less talented brother well ..... = \<br /><br />Trivia : It was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of Claremont , Ont . ( about 20 miles N.east of Toronto ) I recognized many local landmarks / intersections / buildings . I think the Drive - in scene was filmed at the now demolished " Oshawa Drive - in " just before it was torn down .
0 To say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks . As the other commenter says , this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 ( it is especially , incredibly insulting to gays ) . It is awful - and not in a " so bad it 's funny " sort of way either - it 's just plain awful . No , I have to say it : IT STINKS ! ( sorry skunks).<br /><br />From the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for . The " plot " is incoherent , the characterization non - existent , the acting is of the over the top mugging " look at me I 'm being funny ! " school and so it goes on . The set pieces are clumsily set up ( if at all ) and are badly executed , it 's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe , I do n't remember thinking the music stinks ( apart from the songs).<br /><br />To be fair to the makers , they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly : the opening credits include the title " Also starring Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor " ( since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted Ms. Kitt 's contribution from one of her records ) and the second line of the movie runs something like : " ... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus . " Uranus - " Your Anus " geddit ? geddit ? huh ? huh ? ? Your Anus ? The humour really is that cheap.<br /><br />It says strange things about the " comedies " of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say " sh*t " out loud.<br /><br />I paid fifty pence ( about $ 1.00 ) for this movie in a sale . I feel ripped off .
0 Sly Stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother , Frank ... well , roll out those awards now ! Mullet haired , muppet Frank seems to think that every part he plays , calls for him doing the role as an American / Italian Wise - guy refugee from the ' Godfather . ' Please , somebody make him an acting offer ' he can refuse ! ' This film just stinks the place out , even by the terrible overacting in this , Frank still steals the acting dishonours . All the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about , gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films.<br /><br />The plot , what there , is , makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex - crazed nymphets but as this is 15 certificate film , that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat . What happens in the end , I 'm not quite sure as I was losing the will to live long before the film finished.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague and watch ' Deep Impact ' for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth.<br /><br />N.B. Point of order : when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear , she has her knickers / panties under her suspenders / garter belt , it 's knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss . A trivial point , perhaps , but shows how dumb this film is when they ca n't even get this right !
0 102 Dalmatians ( 2000 , Dir . Kevin Lima ) < br /><br />Believed to be cured , Cruella de Vil ( Close ) is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life . Things are going well for Cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street . When the clock strikes on Big Ben , things turn bad . The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back , and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted.<br /><br />Glenn Close reprises her role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film . Every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel , which feels more of a repeat of the previous film , rather than a new story.<br /><br />She 's Changed .  Ken Sheperd ( Ioan Gruffudd )
0 I would n't bring a child under 8 to see this . With puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella 's scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child . < br /><br />The live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite , a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids.<br /><br />I do n't know what the Disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level . The puppies are cute But this movie is spotty at best .
0 After seeing the 1996 remake , I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin . The whole movie was quite funny , and on my view , better than the animated one . But there was actually no need for a second one . First of all , if Cruela is returning , do n't cure her and make her insane again . Just make her break away from jail and that 's a rap . I thought it was not very funny . It 's supposed to have only one original puppy returning . I 'd expected that it should be Lucky , since he was the most appealing , and besides , having Roger and Anita back too . However , they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred , not even one hundred and two , but only THREE puppies , and a parrot that thinks he 's a dog ( clever ) . Gerard Depardieu 's part was pointless . At the end , Cruella suffers way too much , way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true . She gets baked inside a giant cake . That was a desperate attempt of physical humor , trying to imitate the same effect from the first one . That just did n't work . It was too much over the top , and not too funny . I actually felt sorry about Cruella .
0 It is a good film for kids who love dogs . It runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up De Vil . The basic plot is the same as the first movie . The bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog . The bird talks like a human(Eric Idle of Monty Python ) and barks like a dog . It is the comedy that the film needed more of . See it in the matinee so you do n't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney .
0 ... because this was simply awful . 101 Dalamatians was funny even if formulaic , but this is nothing more than puerile drivel . The same plot except with the story excised from it ; the world 's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw ; Tim McInnerny proving that he really ca n't do comedy ( everone remembers Percy in Blackadder but that was his high spot - it 's all been downhill since then ) ; direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you 'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time . Ieuan Grufford better go back to Hornblower sharpish , whilst Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.<br /><br />Perhaps I could be too harsh ; after all I did n't manage to sit through the whole film . It gets 1/10 ; only because I ca n't give it 0 .
0 This film was pure pain . Sitting in the theater for x - amount of minutes , I was wondering when the film was going to start . All the setups were in place ; typical love story , characters have to overcome their short - givings , villain has to emerge , but none of it ever initiated . By the time these things happened , I was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective . In scenes that required immense tension and buildup , it felt like necessary frames were cut . Kid 's stuff does not have to be this way . Children 's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones . The excuse , " hey , its for kids , " is bull . I 'll take " Sword in the Stone " any day . This was terrible . I 'm getting the feeling that Disney will put out anything these days . And as for the kids , the 10-year I saw this with will agree ... pure trash .
0 Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please , please never let < br /><br />him direct again . Timing , pacing , editing : all hopelessly wrong.<br /><br />Three or four decent professionals ( next time , guys , walk off the < br /><br />set ) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like Alice < br /><br />Evans , and the kind of production standards you 'd expect from < br /><br />teen - produced children 's shows on british TV.<br /><br />Greatest mystery : the music . A score so inept , inappropriate and < br /><br />ill - matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is < br /><br />a case of sabotage . Add an acoustic that booms apparently < br /><br />unengineered from a single mike , and a director who only < br /><br />intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen , and we < br /><br />have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of < br /><br />recent years .
0 I do n't know why , but for some sick reason , I think since I 've been on the Disney sequel binge , I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations . The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil , it seemed like a sure hit , but it was just a bomb . I think the reason why these movies do n't work is because 101 Dalmations , the original , was a cartoon , it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults . This was not really that fun because it 's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings , I understand they 're trying to make sure that it 's appealing to the kids , but it 's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film . And 102 Dalmations 's story is n't really that good.<br /><br />Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while , but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being . But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy - napper , but she buys a man 's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she 's changed . But when she sees her probation officer 's Dalmatians , she goes crazy and starts seeing spots , and she looses it . She 's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that Dalmation coat she 's always wanted.<br /><br />Glenn Close is such an amazing actress , very under rated , but her taking on Cruella De Vil , she 's good , but let 's face it , this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case . Also , as cute as the puppies were , it just works more for the animation , it sounds stupid , but it 's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix . I would n't really recommend 102 Dalmations , it 's alright , but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time , this is just the same thing.<br /><br />2/10
0 A sequel to ( actually a remake of ) Disney 's 1996 live - action remake of 101 Dalmations . Cruella deVil ( Glenn Close ) is released from prison after being " cured " of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov ( ugh ! ) . But the " cure " is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben , and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.<br /><br />This movie is bad on so many levels , starting with the fact that it 's a " Thanksgiving family schlock " movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine . Glenn Close over - over - over - over - acts as Cruella . With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script , the endless makeup , getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely - large paycheck.<br /><br />(Speaking of which , where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory , a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line , and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film ? ) Of course , the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs . They serve as the " Macaulay Culkin 's " of this movie , pulling all the stupid " Home Alone " gags on the villains . ( Biting them in the crotch , running over their hands with luggage carts , squirting them with icing , etc . , etc . , etc . , ad nauseum . ) I have to admit , the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans.<br /><br />Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked - out French furrier . The two human " dog lovers " -- rehashed from the earlier film , but with different actors -- are completely boring . When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant , the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers , and their dogs at home , watching the dinner scene from " Lady and the Tramp . " I thought to myself , " Oh please , do n't go there ! " I half - expected the humans to do a satire on the " Lady and the Tramp " dinner scene -- as Charlie Sheen did in " Hot Shots : Part Deux " -- doing the " spaghetti strand kiss , " pushing the meatball with his nose , etc.<br /><br />And do n't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle 's voice.<br /><br />The costumes were nominated for an Oscar , and the costumes in the movie * are * good . But they are the only good thing in the movie . The rest of it is unbearable dreck .
0 This sequel is thoroughly uneven , incoherent and rambling in " plot " ( if there really is one)and tries too damned hard to be modern ( ridiculous , out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate ) and cute ( yawn : there are too many manufactured , belaboured jokes with animals . ) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot . Even Glenn Close ( and she is normally very good ) sweeps through this film , parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard ! It 's a film that is n't even good to look at . This is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel . Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot , characterisation and acceptable acting . This does n't . It is bad .
0 Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars . I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film . In this sequel , Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well ) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away . From that point , we only wait until she starts having crises . Soon enough , she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world , of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur . Apart from Glen Close , I found all cast quite silly but from a child 's eye funny . That is fair enough as its target market is , I assume , children under 12 . Quite a good entertainment for children and families , but did n't do much for me . * out of * * * * *
0 Conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie . There are occasional exceptions , but this is NOT one of them . Disney should have quit while they were ahead . This was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 Dalmatians .
0 102 DALMATIANS [ Walt Disney ] : I was n't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first , a silly padded storyline , terrible over acting by Glenn Close , who hams up every scene as though she 's playing for her own amusement , and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors . Once more the dogs are the only " actors " that seem " real " and that s a stretch . Another wasted effort here . GRADE : D
0 This movie provided NOTHING new or worthwhile . After seeing it , my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining . This is a good example of a " concept only " film -- they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs KNOW it will make $ $ just based on the initial concept.<br /><br />The movie starts with Cruella getting out of prison and going on parole . She no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them -- she simply could n't hurt a flea . This does n't last too long after her release and she 's back to her old ways . Period.<br /><br />The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters . Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me HATE him -- and that is TOUGH considering I am a die - hard Python fan . It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money ( there ca n't be any other reason ) . Cruella 's low self - esteem servant , Tim McInnerny , was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny . And it must have cost a few bucks to get Gérard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well . There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were , I am trying to block them out of my mind.<br /><br />Overall , you 'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel .
0 My 10-year - old daughter , Alexandra , writes:<br /><br />I thought it was very boring , and I thought it was just a repeat of stuff from " 101 Dalmatians . " I could n't wait for the movie to end . The best part was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done . The rest of the film is not worth watching . Thank you .
0 I watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on . I blame this on poor screenplay and direction . Some parts were forcibly introduced ( the gay rape scene ) for no apparent reason . I actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time . I found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy . Too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all ... other than sensational parts for the time . As it covers stuff that was deemed ' sensitive ' , to say the least , during communism , I can see the fascination it produced at the time . That is n't the case anymore though or maybe I see things differently now or a bit of both . The film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book , the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book . Even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made .
0 Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding , who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter Patrick Highsmith ( George Newbern ) and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her " doppelganger " , or evil twin , is out to kill her and her family.<br /><br />This silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously , even if the film - makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious . " Doppelganger " is muddled , with some unpleasantly dumb dialog.<br /><br />Some viewers will note that Drew 's character 's name is drawn from Audrey Hepburn 's role in " Breakfast at Tiffany 's " , and that Newbern 's character 's name is a play on the name of famed author Patricia Highsmith ( he is actually trying to re - write " Breakfast " as a horror film , believe it or not!).<br /><br />I suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film - I mean , writer / director Avi Nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters , and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare.<br /><br />After a silly villain - explains - everything - to - the - audience confrontation , the film goes on to submit a hideous , out - there climax that has to be seen to be believed . This film certainly does not skimp on the gore.<br /><br />But hey ! Drew kills her mother in this one . No , I 'm not joking . Jaid Barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered.<br /><br />Drew is always very watchable , and very sexy in this one . Newbern comes off as a likable - enough , " nice " sort of guy . But the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with Sally Kellerman , an attractive veteran who 's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who 's started a phone sex business(!!!!!!).<br /><br />The film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy , sordid little level.<br /><br />4/10
0 Although I recently put this on my 10 worst films list , I have to say it 's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in " The Maddening " or any of the " Look Who 's Talking " sequels . Still , it 's pretty nauseating , even with sexy Drew Barrymore playing something of a horror - movie answer to Holly Golightly , relocating from New York City to Los Angeles but finding out she 's being stalked by a murderous look - alike . Poor Sally Kellerman , a quirky actress of great acclaim in the ' 70s , is reduced here to a paltry supporting role , and Barrymore 's leading man George Newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor , always pausing for a laugh after every line . The picture is swill , but Drew 's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship , and the identity of the psycho ( although right out of a " Scooby Doo " episode ) is interesting . But as for the finale ... get real ! Who had to clean up THAT mess ? * from * * * *
0 Doppelganger has its moments , but they are few and far between.<br /><br />Essentially , this is a grade B blend of pop - psych thriller , ghost story and horror . Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past ( most of her family has been murdered and she was , in at least one case , the prime suspect ) , or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder ? George Newbern is her new room mate , and most of the action centers on him.<br /><br />Newbern 's character is pretty sympathetic , and both he and Barrymore do decent work ( though not exactly good ) . The mediocre to ( at times ) totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion . Leslie Hope 's character is memorable , but so irritating that you will want to forget her.<br /><br />The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated ( one story arc is psychological realism , the other is supernatural horror ) outlandish climax which is so badly conceived , acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously.<br /><br />Overall , the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan 's first undergraduate film class . The acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them - at least until the film derails utterly and completely.<br /><br />My recommendation - send your doppelganger , but avoid a first - person encounter .
0 I was interested in the topic , and only fans of Drew Barrymore 's dancing on David Letterman 's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it . OK , she shows some breast ( or maybe a body double does ) . The plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible . Neither lead has any material to work with , as the direction of the film leads nowhere . Do n't waste your time . See Donnie Darko instead if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore film , and if you want to see another , skip this and see Darko again.<br /><br />The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well . Refer to Charles Williams ' novel " Descent Into Hell " for something worth considering instead . This is just an excuse to make a B film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at Blockbuster.<br /><br />What makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy ? Give me a break .
0 Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter - ego all over town and it 's really starting to become a pain in the butt.<br /><br />After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer , her encounters with ' the other Drew ' become more frequent . Writer - dude feels that it 's his responsibility to snap ' the real Drew ' out of her stupor , so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time . Not very interesting , and even less scary , but Drew is sexy as usual , especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger ... yeah Drew , that 's hot ! < br /><br />Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real - life Mom , Jaid , with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day ?
0 I have just watched the movie for the first time . I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies . < br /><br />The movie is about a girl ( played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore ) , who moves from NYC to LA in order to get over her recently troubled loss . Short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her , it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin = doppelganger , who haunts her.<br /><br />The movie is quite poor and lousy . Both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it . Summing up it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore .
0 Here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail . Terrible script , lousy acting , amateurish directing , laughable special effects ... it 's just an utterly awful movie . Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you 'll realize the whole thing does n't make a lick of sense . After spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible . In one of those hideous " villain explains the whole movie " sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply ca n't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . Oh , and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell - o monster involved . I 'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened . If for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may I suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes . That would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage .
0 I got the DVD very cheap and I 'm a total Drewbie , and that s probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone.<br /><br />An early Drew movie , she 's looking great , and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her , like a shower scene , a sexy dance scene , quite a number of sexy outfits etc . She does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies.<br /><br />The movie itself is pretty average or sub - average , and much more looking like being made for the TV than one for the cinema . There is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy.<br /><br />The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly do n't understand it . But maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway . But at least you do n't get the end you would be expecting , and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected.<br /><br />Overall I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies .
0 Even in a bad film , there is usually some redeeming feature , something that you can say yes it was terrible , but there was that performance , or that part of the script , or that special effect , this was just simply terrible all over . The acting was laughable , the script terrible , complete with many inexplicable Breakfast at Tiffany 's references , and even the special effects were shoddy at best . This was a very bad film and one that even Drew Barrymore wishes was expunged from history . Watch it if you want to : a ) Suffer harsh self inflicted pain . b ) See just how bad a film can be . This is one film where I can use the cliché " there 's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back " with some justification !
0 Drew Barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods , not only in her career , but in her personal life too . After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality . While she has recovered from that dark past , this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore 's worst days.<br /><br />The movie starts with an interesting premise , very reminiscent to Brian De Palma 's " Raising Cain " ; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror / thriller . Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding , a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother.<br /><br />Suddenly , her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love . In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend , Patrick Highsmith ( George Newbern ) , will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past.<br /><br />Unlike De Palma 's underrated thriller , " Doppelganger " is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it 's purpose , it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history . While Barrymore is definitely not at her best , she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance . The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over - the - top performances , although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them.<br /><br />The script is full of clichés and De Palma 's influence is quite obvious . While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line , the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly does n't do any good . It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons , and excessive use of special effects.<br /><br />The make - up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie . However , the bizarre over - use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB 's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing.<br /><br />The fact that this is a B - Movie is no excuse for it 's low quality , as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie . Sadly , all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second . Worthy for Barrymore 's beauty . 3/10
0 Dear God ! I kept waiting for this movie to " get started " ... then I waited for it to redeem itself ... and when it did neither , I just sat there , dumbfounded that : 1 ) it could possibly be this bad , and 2 ) that I had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity . I had faith that Drew could n't possibly have made this bad of a movie ... and boy , did I ever lose my faith ! Do n't bother with this one ! Drew tried , but the movie was poorly written , poorly acted , and just poorly conceived ! I ca n't believe a script this bad ever got funded ! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea , ( the word " concept " is too big for this movie to even qualify for ! ) and it STILL did n't go anyplace ! Its just pitiful ! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it was n't the worst , baffles me ! Because believe me , if it got any worse I 'd have slit my wrists before finishing it !
0 Are you kidding that was AWFUL ! ! ! < br /><br />But that notwithstanding I got given this film and 3 others and they were all on DVD . The film starts of pretty much an OK movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwards.<br /><br />And the ending well let 's just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history . Lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for you .... <br /><br />3/10
0 Although it 's an R rated movie , I really doubt that you 'll really enjoy it unless you 're a teenager < br /><br />Why ? Because there 's no real plot , no character development , no funny jokes . < br /><br />The only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity . Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks ( pretty nice ones I might add ) to feast your eyes on.<br /><br />I really ca n't understand why this movie has the American Pie title since it 's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them.<br /><br />My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks , but you 're too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie . < br /><br />Gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks
0 American Pie : Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres . On the one hand , it 's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes . On the other hand , it 's porno that 's a tad too soft - core to actually turn on any viewers . Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating , others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness . The characters are barely even two - dimensional , most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile , and the " important " plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.<br /><br />In all fairness , I did not go into this movie without expectations . I liked the original three American Pie movies , and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals . I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters , and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House , I was excited to see this installment . I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms . And I was fine with it , because in the past , these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot . In Beta House , however , it 's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked . They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.<br /><br />This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one - dollar rental . The jokes are lame , the story is non - existent , and the porno - aspect is too tame if that 's all you really care about seeing .
0 Stifler , has finished running his naked mile and is now attending Beta House . Crazy stuff happens , people run around naked and nerds are made fun of and this series is dead in the water . The Naked Mile was a crap film , but I found it to be significantly better then Band Camp . It seems they 've gone back to what did n't work for them and it shows that they do n't care either . You can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly . Young teenage boys who like to see naked women , crude humour and beer drinking will love Beta House , everyone else can pretty much look away.<br /><br />Star Wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it 's ahead of its time special effects . Lord of the Rings created an entire world of mythical creatures and massive battles that dazzled the eye . The Matrix changed the way action and sci / fi films were made , specifically with the cutting edge special effects . With all the advancement in technology , we eagerly await the next big thing that will have our jaws dropped to the floor . Then comes American Pie : Beta House , which pushes the boundaries of what technology can do . When people have created spaceships , landscapes and creatures using CGI , Beta House decides to use this technology to create semen . Yes , the thing that creates life , the thing you see so many times in pornography films is created and time slows down to show us the white residue shoot across the room onto a teddy bear . Is this funny ? Disgusting ? Neither ? Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile , which is surprising considering the previous installments title . Does the film need it ? Of course not , does it ever advance the plot , does it ever ? Does it ever get a laugh ? Does it ever get young boys aroused ? Yes the women are beautiful , but if I am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you might as well just have made a porno.<br /><br />The female who catches the affections of our main character is pretty and does n't annoy the viewer , like previous girls have done in the series , but not once did I ever believe this character would ever do what she does . I 'm pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic . The American Pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world . None of the events in this film would ever happen , if they ever did then I need to attend this school IMMEDIATELY . Is this film suppose to make people feel like they are having a good time ? Well it does n't , we are watching them have a good time , by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having.<br /><br />There is a " Deer Hunter " scene in the film , but to make it " funny " for today 's audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse semen . Are you laughing yet ? Instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head , or face , they place the gun in their mouths . Are you on the floor laughing yet ? The first time we are introduced to Stifler 's roommate , he 's having sex with his girlfriend . Are you cheering at the nudity yet ? The film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house , but then it shifts to them already being in the frat house , but needing to perform certain tasks . Then it shifts to a competition between nerds and the boys . It goes a little " Revenge of the Nerds " on us for a bit and it seems out of place . I honestly do not know what these film is about because it goes all over the place.<br /><br />Most of the comedy seems forced for shock value . Even at the beginning with the Dad showing his son the list of people he has had sex with . The joke is in there somewhere , I think it might be the fact that his wife is not the last name on the list , or it could have been that one of his son 's friend 's mother was on the list . Either one , it does n't work.<br /><br />I guess if you have n't guessed it yet , this film is not funny . Nor does it seem to be focused , the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for does n't shock . Skip this lame installment and any future ones as well . I do not know why I have seen all the entries in the series , but for some unknown reason they seem to have found their way to my eyes .
0 For starters , I would like to say that I 'm a fan of the American Pie series . Even though ' the naked mile ' and this one are the two worst , this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series.<br /><br />First of all , the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film , which is always appreciated.<br /><br />However , there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film . First of all , the story has a very stale ' arc ' structure . First , there is the introduction of the characters , then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad . Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length . Apart from the general staleness of the plot , there is little to no character development , which makes a double whammy of a bad plot.<br /><br />Apart from that , I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film . That is , showing the jocks as the extremely cool , only - thinking - about - sex guys , and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior . Also , it shows females only as sexual objects , and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects.<br /><br />Apart from that , the acting was also poor . With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley.<br /><br />So , in the end , a generally horrid film , if seen from a critical point of view . If seen from a teen point of view , I guess that it 's better , but this film is rated 18 + in most countries , so it should n't really be seen by minors .
0 American Pie has gone a long distance from the first . At first i believe the actors do n't have a clue what their doing and instead it 's just a remake of a college party gone nuts . Story sets out as two freshman college guys ( featuring the young stifler ) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties , sex and of course the booze . The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie . In fact they did n't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.<br /><br />Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free . But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking . I 'm a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty would 've been a better choice instead .
0 For those with little time on their hands , I 'll sum it up quickly , in one word ... pathetic . There are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description . So much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you . Want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes ? You got it ! The reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap . You can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for ! ! ? ? ! ! ! < br /><br />I've watched many a movie franchise decline over the years , but American Pie;Beta House has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie , it 's still a thousand times funnier than this dreck.<br /><br />The plot is predictable , and sometimes you actually feel like you 're watching a school play . The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it ( we 're talking Star Wars levels of suspension , like the kind you need to convince yourself Jar Jar is real)<br /><br />The plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke . There is no acting talent to speak of , all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh . And ohhh how they fail ! ! ! ! Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be . How else can you explain the bulls**t they try to pass off as a story?<br /><br />They pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written , lowest common denominator nonsense . The characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House , but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening . Its a very lazy way of telling a story . It also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so.(Imagine say The Wizard of Oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it , and all we see is Dorothy high - fiving the Scarecrow every now and again and saying " Gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then " ) Lazy . Lazy . LAZY!!!!<br /><br />The female characters have little or nothing to say . All they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie . You braindeads that only seek T&A will not be disappointed , but for that reason alone shame on you . If you buy this on DVD you will be contributing to the downfall of society in your own special way . Congratulations .
0 Band Camp was awful , The Naked Mile was a little better , and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor . Basically Erik Stifler ( John White ) split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity , and now him and Mike ' Cooze ' Coozeman ( Jake Siegel ) are joining Erik 's cousin Dwight ( Steve Talley ) at college . With the promise of many parties , plenty of booze , and enough hot chicks at the Beta House , they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members . But a threat comes into sight with the rivals , GEK ( " Geek " ) House , led by power - hungry nerd ( and sheep shagger ) Edgar ( Tyrone Savage ) offering bigger and better than what Beta have . To settle it once and for all , Beta and Gek go into battle with the banned , for forty years , Greek Games to beat each other in , with the loser moving out . The last champion of the games , Noah Levenstein aka Jim 's Dad ( the only regular Eugene Levy ) runs the show , which sees the people unhooking bras , a gladiator duel floating on water , catching a greased pig , Russian Roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk , wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol ( with puking not disqualifying ) . It all comes to the sudden death , with a guy getting stripper lap dancing , and they have to resist cumming , Beta House win when Edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap . Also starring Flubber 's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler , Meghan Heffern as Ashley , Dan Petronijevic as Bull , Nic Nac as Bobby , Christine Barger as Margie , Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson , Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman , Sarah Power as Denise , Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock . The nudity amount is very slightly increased , as is the grossness of the jokes , and I could guess it being rated one star out of five , but I like it . Adequate !
0 OK so there 's nudity , but hey , there 's free porn on the internet for whomever likes it . And its just silly how they forced tits into every frame . I mean i was embarrassed , not from the nudity but from the far - fetchessness of the producers / writers of this piece of crap.<br /><br />The movie is NOT funny at all , its just extremely predictable all the time . There is no plot , no dramatic content at all . This is way waay worse then the other pie - films and they arnt that great either : ) If you 're really drunk or maybe a 13 year old buy who are really obsessed with tits this might be acceptable , otherwise not . < br /><br />May it forever roth align with crap of the same magnitude with regards Erik the questmaster flash MC
0 Let 's cut to the chase : this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the American Pie teat . Period.<br /><br />The whole plot ( and that should n't imply that there 's a whole lot to go around ) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes.<br /><br />If you 're a Tween guy , and you 're too squeamish to purchase actual pornography , then this is the movie for you . Otherwise , the movie does n't have much to offer at all.<br /><br />The acting is sub - par , the character development is virtually non - existent , and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity , binge drinking and pranks ( none of which are particularly memorable).<br /><br />Go buy real porn if that 's what you want to see , and if not , go watch a GOOD movie . Animal House , Kids , or even the original American Pie are all great cinematic works , and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity.<br /><br />"It 's not how much , it 's how you use it "
0 This was the worst film i have seen for a long time . < br /><br />Not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other American Pie movies , the story is obvious , flat and absolutely not funny . < br /><br />The girls are nice though , but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film.<br /><br />This film seems to be a very bad made sex ad , made for an audience that is not older than 12.<br /><br />I never visited an American college , but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes.<br /><br />Save your time , do something else .
0 So , American Pie : Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series . Although , it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it ( ca n't that guy get better gigs?).<br /><br />There is very little to compliment this movie on . There are n't any funny jokes . The acting is painful to watch , especially the girl with the " southern " accent which sounds more like a Canadian 's impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word " ya'll . " This movie makes me feel like such an idiot . Why did n't I apply to a college where nobody goes to class ( but everybody gets good grades ) , girls consistently take their clothes off in public , everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs , and you can ejaculate all over a girl 's family photos without her minding ? Really , this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn . Maybe for the next one , they 'll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead . I 'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stifler 's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that .
0 Another American Pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all . It does n't deserve the name American Pie . They should have stopped at " The Wedding".<br /><br />This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on . When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series . It does n't fell like American Pie at all . It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies.<br /><br />I do n't recommend it ever . Actually i do n't recommend any of the " American Pie Presents " movies . Just stick with the nice original trilogy.<br /><br />2/10
0 Just finished watching American Pie : Beta House and I got ta say , this was such a garbage pile of crap . The first 3 American Pies were hilarious , the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie.<br /><br />As you figured out from the title of the movie , Beta House , is about a fraternity , freshmen , girls and , the most original part of them all , falling in love . Of course , the guy that has his way with the chicks is Stifler , who , along with his mates , tries to complete another apparently impossible task . It was unrealistic and super fake . Its just really predictable and the plot is so weak . Both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing ( something like that ) To sum it up : awful acting + dull script + wrong use of the American Pie franchise = total waste of time ! This movie is unbearable . I give it a two out of ten , although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls , like 2 funny scenes :)
0 First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they 're all the result of inbreeding.<br /><br />Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they were n't the most amazing movies that I 'd ever seen they were all right ( and outright masterpieces compared to the three " American Pie Presents " films ) , I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?<br /><br />I also have a few other questions too.<br /><br />Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources ? < br /><br />who approved the final script ( and what was that person smoking when they approved it ) ? < br /><br />And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart?<br /><br />There is so much wrong with this movie that I ca n't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so I 'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.<br /><br />The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting.<br /><br />While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,<br /><br />the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer " I know this is n't funny and I 'm wasting my talents but hey I 'm getting payed for it so who cares " he does n't even try to make any of his jokes funny ( he really deserves better than this garbage ) . < br /><br />As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows , Tyrone Savage ( from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back ) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating ( there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he 'd die a slow and painful death on screen , Christopher McDonald ( NCIS , Law & Order ) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.<br /><br />Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating ( the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating ) . < br /><br />It 's interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage ( I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it ) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film would n't have been released , < br /><br />but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it 's all done in the name of comedy , if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating.<br /><br />The last thing that really annoys me is the writing , this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass , nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes , never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.<br /><br />the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive , this pie is filled with road apples .
0 well its official . they have just killed American Pie . The first 3 were absolutely hysterical , but this one and the others have been awful . I mean the story is about two college fraternity 's who battle each other for its houses , I mean come on talk about a weak plot , the first three dealt with growing up , change and marriage , which are all worthy points of development in human society.<br /><br />The new Stifler is the biggest joke , I know its hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but so no cigar . I give this movie a 3 because there is 2 - 3 funny bits in the film.<br /><br />The best character in this movie of course is Jim 's dad i do n't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films .
0 I have to say that I used to be a huge fan of the series . The first 3 were great and the others had their moments , but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse . I know they are made for DVD films but some effort would be nice.<br /><br />There are no laughs , just a couple of good one - liners that will bring a smile if that . There is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks . But neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work.<br /><br />To add to all that this is a RACIST film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist . I am NOT one of those people who think everything should be politically correct . But the portrayal of minorities is very offensive.<br /><br />I would n't waste any time on this garbage . See the previous versions , they will make you laugh not sick .
0 To summarize this movie : Without a real plot , this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes . The music is just awful , the humor is n't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks . It seems to me , that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy , who thinks that drinking is cool , women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks . Also , the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies , other than a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one . The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls . Do n't watch this movie and do n't be fooled by the 5.4 rating , because it obviously overrated and does n't deserve anything above 2 .
0 This story had a different angle that intrigued me , enough to buy a previously - viewed VHS sight - unseen . That was a mistake.<br /><br />In what could have been a very nice story - about badly crippled people at a hospital , and their various personalities - turned quickly into a very profane soap opera with unlikeable characters.<br /><br />We have " Bloss " ( William Forsythe ) the stereotype racist white person , who says the f - word every other sentence and is so despicable they did n't give him a first name in the movie . He 's a lot of fun to be around . Then , there is " Raymond Hill " ( Wesley Snipes ) , a fast - talking womanizer . Snipes must have liked those fast - talking " hip " arrogant roles because he played in a number of them , like in " White Men Ca n't Jump . " Then there is sweet Helen Hunt playing " Anna " that wonderful caring , loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film , " Joel Garcia " ( Eric Stoltz).<br /><br />Yup , this is heartwarming , feel - good type stuff . It just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks . But , if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy film ..... you might really like this ! Add in a dose of Hollywood political correctness and there you go ! What more could anyone want ?
0 THE WATERDANCE ( 1991 ) The main character of The Waterdance , played by Eric Stoltz , finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured . And there he must face an harsh new life , confined to a wheelchair . It 's an interesting , and promising premise , but unfortunately , it fails to deploy . What ensues instead is largely Hollywood schmaltz , with some interesting moments . Certainly the cast ( Eric Stoltz , William Forsythe , Wesley Snipes , et al ) is brilliant , and perform well here as one would expect , but their talents are wasted . The characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another , and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable ( the Snipes character being the exception ) . I suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people 's ideas about the handicapped being " crippled " or " weak " , by depicting them , for the most part , as in - your - face pricks , but it makes for an entirely annoying experience . Admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through , in a way that is not softened or romanticized , which is useful , and a good idea , but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with , and that 's worth dealing with , it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be , to varying degrees , despicable . They would n't have to be Disneyfied , either ; surely there 's a middle ground somewhere . By the film 's conclusion , the Eric Stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person , but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end , we could n't care less . < br /><br />In addition to its character problems , the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many Hollywood movies suffer from ; the syndrome does n't really have an official name , but you might call it " Inexplicable Forgiveness Syndrome " . It goes something like this : characters abuse the crap out of each other , and then without so much as an apology , all is forgiven ( an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie The Breakfast Club , in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot ; as a result  they love him . In one of the the latest examples , Spiderman 3 , supervillain The Sandman lays waste to a chunk of Manhattan , then wails on Spiderman for what seems like about 15 monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to " bye , now " ) . The most egregious example of IFS in The Waterdance is a sequence in which , after being called the n - word by William Forsythe 's racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene , the Wesley Snipes character whoops it up with the same Forsythe character in the next scene , as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence . Again , without so much as an " Oh yeah , sorry about that business back there where I , you know , called you the n - word " . It makes me wonder , do these people actually watch these movies before they release them , or do they just film them with their eyes closed , kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number , and call it a day 's work ?
0 This really does n't match up to Castle of Cagliostro . Lupin is n't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive . The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just is n't interesting . < br /><br />The only good thing about this ' un is the nudity ( only in the uncut version ) provided by Fujiko . It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes . CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set - pieces . The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging . < br /><br />Zenigata , Goemon and Jigen do n't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time . It 's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing . < br /><br />The DVD is in full - frame with Dolby Stereo sound . It has a decent amount of extras , including quite a few trailers . But one curious thing . There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted . Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote .
0 I know that movies are n't necessarily supposed to mirror reality , but this one got on my nerves . It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about " psychological trauma " and mental illness . The " psycho mom " thing has been done too many times before ( and usually done better ) and much of the rest of the plot is far - fetched as well . The acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />One highlight : I am a long - time fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH regular , Jon Lindstrom.<br /><br />Anyway , if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it , in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies , then this movie might be tolerable . If you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards.<br /><br />I'm sorry I spent my time watching it .
0 If you have plenty of time to waste ... it 's OK . It moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter . < br /><br />The acting is OK . Mariana Klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable.<br /><br />William R. Moses played a pretty good part as the husband.<br /><br />Gail O'Grady , as the wife , had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed.<br /><br />The ending is sort of silly . Like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time .
0 this movie delivers . the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he 's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off.<br /><br />but this movie does n't stop there , when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer . < br /><br />stereotypical grilling dads , several plot lines that go nowhere , and a former seaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect Saturday night at home .
0 With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you figure this one wo n't go wrong . But what can I say ? This was a horrible misfire . The movie is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn . The movie is incredibly disjointed and I did not understand anything about it . Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.<br /><br />That song about arabella Cinderella ' is pretty cool , but that is it . I only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie , this is almost the definition of one . I guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times , in terms of it 's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality , the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing , not to mention the direction is just so out there . < br /><br />Peter Sellers in particular is very hit and miss , he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career , to dumb movies like this and the Magic Christian , which was very similar to this one in context and style , but that movie did have a few funny moments . This one is senseless , and I am sad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie . Not recommended for anyone .
0 I read that " There 's a Girl in My Soup " came out during Peter Sellers 's low period . Watching the movie , I 'm not surprised . Almost nothing happens in the movie . Seemingly , the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the movie ; it does n't . The whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything . Maybe I have n't seen every movie about middle - aged to elderly people trying to be hippies , but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name.<br /><br />All in all , both Sellers and Hawn have starred in much better movies than this , so do n't waste your time on this . Pretty worthless .
0 Peter Sellers ( one of my favorite actors ) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey , but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn 's youth ( just after her Oscar win ) can not begin to pull this one out of the mud . As a skirt - chasing celeb in his 40 's , Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.<br /><br />A 3 out of 10 . Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type.<br /><br />I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well , because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 ( a very good year for films - CATCH-22 , M.A.S.H. , HUSBANDS , JOE , WUSA , FIVE EASY PIECES and many others ) . You ca n't win them all !
0 Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been . But his choice of films , say , after 1964 , was very unfortunate . He did n't seem to realize how to use his talents . He would have been better off working with more of the Kubricks of the film world than the people he did . Of his later films , only " The Optimists of Nine Elms " and " Being There " have impressed me of those I have seen.<br /><br />That said , the Boultings and Sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - I have yet to see " Carlton Browne " and " Heavens Above ! " - at least in the sense of using Sellers well to a degree . But , " There 's a Girl in My Soup " really is a poor film and a dire choice on Sellers ' part in terms of character . In his films from 1955 - 64 , you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles . Here , you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead . It 's almost Sellers playing a Niven cad without the joviality . He certainly does not convince , try as he might , or create an interesting character . He should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as Cary Grant , and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.<br /><br />Hawn and Sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry ; this is no easy , genial romance of the like perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy . It is very artificial seeming , all the way through - I know that it is part of Danvers ' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies , but he does n't really change from that in a way that convinces . Sellers has a very grating way of playing " charm " as well ... this character really has no depth , and really does not gain the viewer 's sympathy or interest . Sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty , iconoclastic performance in " Lolita".<br /><br />There really is nothing to say about the plot , direction or characters , as frankly they leave little or no impression . This is truly one of the most anaemic , complacent , misguided and lightly dull films I have ever seen . A nonentity of a " vehicle " for Sellers ' undisputed talents.<br /><br />Rating:- * 1/2/ * * * * *
0 Annoying , static comedy with a painfully miscast Peter Sellers as a smarmy , self - centered Casanova who always has his way with the ladies . A major blemish on Sellers ' filmography , and , even worse , a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star . ( * )
0 Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently , but could n't get myself to watch it through to the end . Just awful ! I ca n't even remember the plot . All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie , which was bad enough . There 's a lot of scrambling around , but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy , it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes . Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this . GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen , and that is saying something . Jeez , because of IMDb 's 10 lines rule , I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made - for - TV sequel . Disney , hang your head in shame .
0 There are just so many things wrong with this movie.<br /><br />To begin with , the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten . The overall movie is ( mercifully ) short already , but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion ( how did the miss a reference to " The Wiz " on that one ? ) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot . In short , the script had the seed of a good idea , but needed quite a bit of reworking.<br /><br />Second , it could have done without the crude humor . The original also had some that it could have done without , but at least there it was almost an afterthought -- here , flatulence and urination abound.<br /><br />Third , the show is a little too self - aware . The original series had that well enough , as did the first movie , but here it 's just way , way too much . The Brendan Fraser in - jokes were just a bit over the top ( and why no mention of the " new Ursula " ? ) . Other gags with the Narrator , especially a couple of interactions near the end , also exceed good sense.<br /><br />Fourth , a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work . In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp was n't a real elephant ( except by behavior , of course ) , but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb . Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they 're good or bad , and they at least do succeed on that count , so it 's a relatively small problem , but it 's still there.<br /><br />All that said , Christopher Showerman 's performance as George is decent enough . It lacks Brendan Fraser 's charm , but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison -- he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth , which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward - inspired movie but was n't here . Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original.<br /><br />Most other performances were pretty standard , not standing out in my mind as either good or bad .
0 When I go to see movies I would stay up and watch it or if I did not like it , I would go sleep , but this was pure crap , I actually got up and walked out! .... This was poorly script and put together , I hated it . Also , they should not have taken Brendan Frasier off , he was much better . This was not as good as I had expected , considering that I really liked George of The Jungle 1 , and the graphics were n't as good as the first one , for instance , the bird , and when ever he crashed in a tree . I hope that the director of this takes heed , and next movies he make , he needs to reconsider ... horrible ! I really would like to give Ursla a job well done , as she made the movie worthwhile ( until I walked out) ... overall I give this movie a 2 out of 10
0 This movie was on t.v the other day , and I did n't enjoy it at all . The first George of the jungle was a good comedy , but the sequel .... completely awful . The new actor and actress to play the lead roles were n't good at all , they should of had the original actor ( Brendon Fraiser ) and original actress ( i forgot her name ) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating , not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy , this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought . It was good to see Ape the ape back , but was n't as fun as the first , they should of had the new George as Georges son grown up , and still had Bredon and ( what s her face ) in the film , that would 've been a bit better then it was .
0 Let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George : Narrator : Huh ? Wait a minute ! Who the heck are you ? George : Me new George . Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser . Narrator : How did you get the part ? George : New George just lucky , I guess . < br /><br />Sadly , that 's the only funny part in the entire movie.<br /><br />It was still entertaining ... But then again , i 'm easily entertained ... <br /><br />I would n't say this is the worst movie i 've ever seen ( that title goes to the terribly un - funny Disaster Movie ... ) , This movie falls # 7 on my bottom 15 list ... <br /><br />If your a small child who is easily entertained , you 'll enjoy this movie . If you 're a movie - watcher who wants a good , funny movie , You 'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one ..
0 666 : The Child starts as a plane crashes , the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named Donald ( Boo Boo Stewart ) who is adopted by news reporter Erika ( Sarah Lieving ) & her cameraman husband Scott Lawson ( Adam Vincent ) after they covered the incident for Channel 6 news . At first Donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around , after warnings from a Nun & Vicar Scott begins to believe that Donald is evil & the cause of all the deaths ... <br /><br />This straight - to - DVD horror flick was directed by Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson & one has to say 666 : The Child is really rather poor . Whenever I see The Asylum is responsible for a film I get worried , I get very worried since their track record is awful . They seem to specialise in making & /or distributing low budget horror films which are usually rip - offs of some recent successful big budget horror film & in the case of 666 : The Child you do n't need a degree in rocket science to realise that it 's a complete rip - off to cash in on the recent The Omen ( 2006 ) which was released the same year . The script by Benjamin Henry & Austin Laurel is terrible & simply ca n't match the ambitions of the the Hollywood equivalent , I mean just what exactly does Donald the Antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town ? It 's hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it ? Every character in 666 : The Child is some form of the main character 's from The Omen , the adopted parents , the Priest who tries to warn them & the sinister babysitter . There 's a real lack of incident , there 's barely any gore & the plot is poor . I mean Donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random & needless , what were all the disgusting pictures Donald drew all about , where did the babysitter come from & there 's just nothing that ties everything together & it 's just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly . The references to the number 6 also becomes annoying & are very unsubtle.<br /><br />Director Perez does alright I suppose , it 's competent if nothing else . There 's virtually no blood or gore , there 's a few sprays of blood , a cut off hand & someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen . It 's certainly not scary , there 's no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house & there 's no tension because we never really know what Donald is trying to do & there fore there 's no threat from him.<br /><br />Technically the film is alright , it 's reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference . The acting is n't that great but at the same time I 've seen worse.<br /><br />666 : The Child is a poor mans The Omen rip - off , I 'd sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week . Not good & definitely not recommended . Followed by the sequel 666 : The Beast ( 2007 ) which also went straight - to - DVD .
0 Well I watched this last night and the one thing that did n't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward . There was no beating around the bush that this kid was the Anti - Christ . However the movie was just poorly written . For example , they never explained how they made the dentist incident an " Accident " or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet . The death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all . The kid they chose to play the Anti - Christ was boring and they really could 've picked a better kid . Just do n't waste your time watching this .
0 Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and to the expense of Tobe Hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one . Englund plays the well known Marque De Sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain . The story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and I became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie . All I saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this Arabian with alot of money and finds out that he 's out to have her killed and then Englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the Madam Momoselle(spelled that wrong ) or whoever it was in the picture above De Sades wall . The movie was terrible , I am surprised at Hooper for hireing Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable , especially the part about the eyes . Englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move " Nightmare on Elm St. " by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes . Terrible , absolutely terrible .
0 1st watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10(Dir - Tobe Hooper ) : Scary , yet sadistic(which makes sense ) portrayal of a relative of the Marquis De Sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did . This Tobe Hooper film really does n't do a whole lot different than his similar in style Freddy Krueger movies with the same star ( Freddy himself - Robert Englund ) playing a dual role(the Marquis De Sade and his relative ) . It is also seems like it wants to really poke at Christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie . Could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence , but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes . My final thought is why would Hooper want to make this movie . It obviously took awhile to actually get distributed , then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with Hooper 's name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore . It 's obvious this did n't work .
0 Normally I would never rent a movie like this , because you know it 's going to be bad just by looking at the box . I rented seven movies at the same time , including Nightmare on Elm Street 5 , 6 and Wes Craven 's New Nightmare . Unfortunately , when I got home I found out the videostore - guy gave me the wrong tape . In the box of Wes Craven 's New Nightmare I found this lame movie.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly boring , the acting is bad and the plot does n't make any sense . It 's hard to write a good review , because I have no idea what the movie was really about . At the end of the movie you have more questions then answers.<br /><br />On ' Max Power 's Scale of 1 to 10 ' I rate this movie : 1<br /><br />PS I would like to correct Corinthian 's review ( right below mine ) . He says Robert Englund is ripping off lingerie , riding horses naked , etc . The guy that did those things was Mahmoud , played by Juliano Mer , not by Robert Englund .
0 I saw this film recently in a film festival . It 's the romance of an ex - alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle - aged woman who works in an employment office ( INEM ) . I found the story very simple and full of clichés , taking the ' social ' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy . The lead actor did a good job , he definitely looks like an alcoholic man , but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman , she looks , acts and talks very much like a ' high - standing ' woman . What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself . She does it in all her movies anyway . The whole mise - en - scene of the film was very poor . The photography is ugly , not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio . The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times . The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira , but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly . In my opinion this film is not worth watching . Only if you really love Pereira 's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit . Anyway , I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time . The film - maker was by the door . I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films , specially one that is made to please everybody .
0 Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex ? This came on at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I could n't believe what they showed . Thank God my son was outside or I would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft / medium porn ! Do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt ? Kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show ? ? ? ! ! ! The acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE ! There was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie . Randy Travis was really good in his role . If the writers , directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes . What has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction ? Where can I complain ?
0 I 'm surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks . My thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male . Whipped and tortured women , merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients , introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre . The opening and the hand - smashing are DJANGO rip - offs . THE SHOOTER however lacks the style of e.g. DJANGO . Score , acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here . And the actors do n't have an Italian accent.<br /><br />4 / 10 .
0 When I look back on my college days at Ohio University , there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories . Channel 23 is OU 's local access channel and until the last few years , pretty much played anything they were sent . This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then scanning pictures of them online , to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs.<br /><br />However , the king , in my opinion , of the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater . The first time I watched it was around 2AM . I should have been studying . Or sleeping . Or watching regular TV . But no , all that is for pussies . My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater , and when it was complete , I do n't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened . But sure enough , it was on a few nights later , and we had to come to grips that this movie did , in fact , exist.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how awful it is , but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living . The plot is disjointed , the acting terrible , the everything soul scarring , but by god , if there are others watching with you , its impossible not to have a good time watching it . Its sort of like the first time you hear " Guts " by Chuck Pahalniuk . You hear it , you 're disgusted and shaken , but five minutes later , all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured.<br /><br />Long story short , Midnight Skater , for all of its epic flaws , makes for some very late night fun . Plus , I desperately want the Theme to Midnight Skater . Kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it . Sweet God I love that song .
0 A cast of 1980 's TV movie and TV series guest stars ( Misty Rowe , Pamela Hemsley , Clevon Little , Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models . Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications.<br /><br />Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest . This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax . I really ca n't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there . ( I also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking , to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up )
0 Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems , nonetheless , to be regarded as a perfect " catch " by any woman that runs across him ; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co - produced the film ? He 's a " hero " whom it 's very difficult to empathize with , so the movie is in trouble right from the start . However , it 's troubles do n't end there . It has the production values of a TV - movie ( check out that head made of clay or something , near the end ) , and the ending cheats in a way that I ca n't reveal , in case anyone wants to see the movie ( highly unlikely ) . Let 's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows . ( * 1/2 )
0 The worst kind of film . Basically , the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum 's security for several days . Eh?<br /><br />The plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery , assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current , which it wouldn't.<br /><br />It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter , but that system would n't fit into the case . Sorry to be anal , but this is n't even close to being plausible . The rest of the film was n't a great deal better and I 'm left wondering why the budget could n't have been donated to charity or me .
0 This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety . Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester 's character . I get the feeling he never even read the book , just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read " Grumpy , broody , murky past . " He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy . There is no chemistry . The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave . GO AND REREAD THE BOOK . ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY . AND BY THE WAY : A " PASSIONATE " LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT HER FACE .
0 I 've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment . I just did n't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars . A lot of staring and theatrical acting just does n't do it for me , and what was all that about putting Tim in the role of Rochester . Had the casting director actually ever read the book . Very strange ! He 's a fine actor but Mr. Rochester he definitely is n't ! And Zelah was just , well , strange , bit of a mix matched couple . In it 's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation , but overall did n't capture any of the magic of the novel . Certainly would n't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel . A real let down !
0 Considering the limits of this film ( The entire movie in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors total ) it should have been much better made . IF you have these limits in making a film , how could the lighting be so bad ? And the actors were terrible , were talking a hair below the acting in Clerks , except that was an enjoyable movie , this had no substance . Well it tried to , but really fails.<br /><br />It makes attempt to be self - referencing in a couple parts , but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad . And the main character Neal guy , what a pathetic looser . Clearly like 10 people total made this ' film ' and they all knew each other , and it probably was a real rock band that they had , but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around . This was made in 2005 , but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre - grunge era.<br /><br />Thankfully I did n't pay to see this ( Starz on Demand delivers again ! ) but it was under the title " The Possessed " not Studio 666 , it does n't matter what you do to the title , it ca n't help this . This could have been a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad film - making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this , working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can . Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough . And that music video , wow that was bad , I fast fowarded through that.<br /><br />So 2/10 is fair , if you are into the whole b - movie crap I suppose you 'll go and see this .
0 I think that if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of English to come up with a script , it would make more sense than this . I could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film . This sounds really mean , but I 'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess ( see what I did there ? ) neither the skills to act or to write anything , ever.<br /><br />Watch this only if you 're incredibly drunk , high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists . I will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom . After that , I will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my DVD player , fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery.<br /><br />Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL/10 Breasts - 9/10
0 After a quasi - Gothic , all - fruity music video , the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself . In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll . We do n't live n that world . The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence . When I say clown , I mean actual clown . He tell them they 're all going to die via Cassidy 's ghost ( the spirit possesses Dora , one of the band - mates ) We could n't care less as the characters are all boring , vapid , and extremely horribly acted . Written by Adam Hackbarth ( an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one ) , and directed by Corbin Timbrook ( who after The attendant , and Tower of blood , HAS to know that he keeps making crap for a living ) , this movie s a constant battle between the film 's incompetence and the viewer 's need to stay awake . Not enough blood to appease gore - hounds , nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs . This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone.<br /><br />My Grade : F < br /><br />Eye Candy : Amanda Carraway gets topless < br /><br />Where i saw it : Starz on Demand
0 One of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words ' Wanna watch the worst horror movie ever ? ' I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes . I had expected your typical cheesy b - slasher but this was beyond B. This is Z - slasher , the lowest of the low . With obviously low budget , extremely bad acting , bad lightning , no plot , really bad so - called ' special effects ' , shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like House of Wax look like Oscar - winning masterpieces . The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some very nice tits . Most of what I said during this film was along the lines of ' Wow this is actually SO BAD ' , ' This is the worst movie ever ' and ' I 'm not drunk enough for this ' . So in conclusion : do n't waste your time ( or money ! ) .
0 Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all ( not even live there ) , and those actors need to find another job . The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life ... and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which , unfortunately for me it did not.<br /><br />Even at the end , the credits gave me anxiety . I guess there were n't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly ... very slowly.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a great " How Not To Make a Movie " guide . Too bad I ca n't give a 0 .
0 This movie is bad . If you are thinking about watching it , there is only one decent scene in the movie , and it lasts about 5 seconds ( Amanda Carraway 's topless scene ) . The rest of the movie is horrible . I think high school plays probably have better acting . The plot makes no sense at all . The set was pretty lame , and it was n't even good to make fun of . It was just dull and very very bad ! I watched this on Starz so I thought it had to be at least decent . The mini description sounded like it 'd be alright . The girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie , after you have to watch some horrible music video . The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them . Just cuts from one scene to another , no smoothness . Kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is , to explaining why the plot sucks . The audio gets low at some points , where you can barely hear it , then gets loud with gay ' horror screams ' thrown in at random points in the movie . It is the same sound every time . This is now officially the worst movie I have ever seen < br /><br />Acting : 0/10 Effects : 1/10 Storyline : 0/10 Music : 3/10<br /><br />Lame - meter : 1,000,000 / 10
0 I am a MAJOR fan of the horror genre ! I LOVE horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds . Some of my favorites are the really " good " bad horror flicks . But this movies has NOTHING to warrant it 's viewing ! ! I 'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that 's wrong with it.<br /><br />The script is horrid . The acting is horrid . The FX are not even worth discussing . The " set " is an absolute JOKE ! ! The sad thing is I think there MAY be some real potential in a couple of the actors , but this vehicle left them NOTHING to work with!!!<br /><br />Suffice it to say I saw it for " free " & feel I was robbed ! ! The time you 'd WASTE watching this would be better spent flossing your cat .
0 for the most part , On Demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies , and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen , and already have an opinion on . It was either this , or Invinicible ( I like Mark Wahlberg movies ) , which I have n't seen , and I was actually in a movie watching mood , which does n't happen often anymore because I 've already watched all the movies i own a million times , and that 's a lot of movies , and I do n't have much interest in new movies , and boy , this movie made me regret it . I 'm not going to put in any spoilers , I 'm just going to tell you that only a FEW of the very FEW actors in this movie , are half way decent . I think the main girl , the dead one who kills everyone , is very annoying looking , but convincing ; I 'd take her for psycho bitch anyday , so she fits her roll well , though it is lame . The blood is n't that great , only a few of the kills , or may I say " woundings " are alright , but you do n't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing . Towards the end of the movie I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off , and being a band member , the ' recording ' parts were n't very interesting either , though what happened would truly happen when going about recording . I 'm done , if you want to watch this , suit yourself .
0 Cassidy(Kacia Brady)puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend Neal(Jason Dibler ) . Cassidy was the lead singer of a " demons and death " rock band who could n't shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend 's neglect towards her(you know , I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head ) . She returns , however , possessing the soul of Dora(Jill Small)her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by Cassidy 's untimely death . But , Cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected .. she 's consumed by this anger towards mainly Neal , but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught Dora .. not Cassidy returning for payback.<br /><br />Lousy micro - budget horror flick looks cheap , has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work , and boasts cheap kill - scenes which are n't effective one bit .
0 Well , because I 'm a musician I thought , maybe I 'll check this movie out on TMC , nothing else good on . One of the worst mistakes of my life so far , and it 's only half done . I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting , crappy filming and crappy effects . But nope , I do n't even get the pleasure of that . Even the " musicians " were n't very good . I was hoping for maybe some laughs , but I was n't sure if they were attempting to throw in one - liners or not . But now I have to sit here and watch the rest just until Pulp Fiction starts . Or maybe something better . And now i get to sit here typing until i have 10 lines
0 This ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies I 've seen so far on Starz on Demand . They seem to pick up every straight to DVD crap - fest they can find and put it on here.<br /><br />Why ? Who knows ! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on TV . To be honest , this looked terrible from the moment I saw the trailer -- but I did give it a real chance.<br /><br />I always try to have an open mind about low - budget movies . Some of the best movies I 've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great.<br /><br />This is not one of those movies.<br /><br />You know the plot by now , I 'm sure , if you 're reading this . Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom . It 's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad " heavy metal " music video . Whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting , but it really , really does n't . Anyway , she kills herself . Then she possesses someone . Then some killing starts . It 's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible . When the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping . Was that the best sound effect they could come up with ? I could find a better sound effect to use for free , ( with no copyright , ) on the internet ... right . now.<br /><br />Don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you . They are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying.<br /><br />Laughable .
0 STUDIO 666 ( aka THE POSSESSED in the UK ) is another sub - par slasher that has the appearance of a straight - to - DVD movie.<br /><br />Whilst many of the straight - to - DVD movies are fast - paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so - bad - it's - good sense , STUDIO 666 is a lamentable failure.<br /><br />At the time of writing , every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review . Every one of these people have hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />The two people ( at the time of writing ) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously . Obviously they 've seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror.<br /><br />The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it does fare better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM , two extremely mediocre slasher movies that I would not wish on my worst enemy!<br /><br />The plot of this movie must have been done hundreds , if not thousands of times . The movie only has a slight twist ( and one that is badly handled ) to the usual expectations . A depressed singer commits suicide . Soon after , her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends . The said possessed friend goes on a killing spree . The rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up . You 'll just have to see it for yourself , providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is very poor for the most part . The actress who played Dora was an exception to this . Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen . She helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts . Unfortunately , some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie.<br /><br />The direction was equally poor . The villains did not seem the least bit menacing , every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension , atmosphere was non - existent and the camera - work was incredibly basic . Some of the special effects ( if you can call them that ) reminded me of the TV series , GHOST STORIES . Unfortunately for the producers of this movie , GHOST STORIES had intelligently written scripts , believable performances and made superb use of camera angles . Maybe if the producers had watched that TV series closely , they 'd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie!<br /><br />The music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie . It 's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either . Do n't get me started on that awful song played at the beginning!<br /><br />Some aspects of the movie , particularly dialogue , are unintentionally funny . Unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up ( or should it be down ) to the so - bad - it's - good level.<br /><br />Overall , STUDIO 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects . I recommend this only to those who are fans of straight - to - DVD movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made .
0 As with most of the reviewers , I saw this on Starz ! OnDemand . After watching the preview with my girlfriend , she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched . I , on the other hand , thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching . I mean , the design of Dr. Meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title . After watching it , I can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it ( namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story ) , it 's best to pass over this one.<br /><br />*Major Spoilers Ahead * After making their first video for their as - yet - unfinished CD , the lead singer , Cassidy , kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend Neil to notice her . 3 months later , the band is trying to decide if they 're going to finish the album or not . To try and see what Cassidy would have wanted , they go to see an old psychic friend of hers , Dr. Meso , and try to contact her through him . In his card reading , Dr. Meso turns up four straight Death cards for the four remaining band members . Bad times are ahead . ( I just wanted to make a point that later in the film , they do explain that the Death card really just represents change . Kudos to them on that at least . ) Even without the approval of their deceased friend , they decide to go ahead and finish the album . But while in the bathroom , Cassidy 's best - friend , Dora , catches a glimpse of her deceased friend . When another band - mate goes in to check on her , Dora is standing in the dark , requesting his sunglasses . That 's when the killing begins.<br /><br />My main problem with the film from the very get - go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault . Too many warping effects , unnecessary zooms , and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film . An incoherent storyline does n't help anything either . While the narrative hangs together for the first part , once Cassidy is resurrected , everything falls apart . We have jump - cuts between Cassidy and Dr. Meso ( who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building ) , which show they are connected in some way or another . However , within a few minutes of that revelation , we find that Cassidy really is an independent being from Meso . She then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind Jack Nicholson as The Joker . But not in a good way.<br /><br />From this point on , the whereabouts of Cassidy are shown , but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence . One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk , when a character enters in the next , she 's nowhere to be found . As he moves behind the desk , we see her at the end of a hallway . Then in another room grabbing the keys ( which Neil already has ) , then back again . Not to mention that from one moment to the next , Cassidy 's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it . One moment , she wants to kill everyone ( although she 's only wounded 90 % of the characters ) - the next she 's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again . Sound confusing ? That 's because it is . It 's a jumbled mess that I 'm sure the writer could n't even figure out.<br /><br />As for the performances , most are particularly wooden . Some though are interesting , but overall this is n't a piece that would be known for it 's acting . The story is the driving force behind this piece .
0 Julia ( Kristina Copeland ) travels with her husband Steven Harris ( Steven Man ) and their baby son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family in Savage Island , an island of their own . The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island . While waiting for the boat , Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor , and when her brother Peter ( Brendan Beiser ) arrives , he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island . The reckless Peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off ; however , he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage 's family , but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal . Later , the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son . The Young family does not accept the trade , and they initiate a deadly war between families.<br /><br />"Savage Island " is a very low - budget movie , with a stupid screenplay , amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting . The flawed story is totally absurd , and there are many unbelievable situations . For example , how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family ? The logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue Peter . Then the Young family vanishes ; Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends , and nobody chases them ? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning . There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject . I believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are . The good cast deserved a better material to work . My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Ilha de Sangue " ( " Island of Blood " )
0 Savage Island ( 2003 ) is a lame movie . It 's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting . Not only that the storyline and script was wretched . I do n't know why this movie was made . I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry . This one made my blood boil . The situations were inane at best . If I made a movie like this it would have been a short . Really because those backwood " idjits " would n't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema . But this movie is virtually unwatchable . I do n't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you 're going to do that make the movie enjoyable , not some tired retread of superior horror films ( sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk . If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1 .
0 Much has been written about Purple Rain , the apparent " quin - essential " musician bio movie , however I 'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it 's high praise.<br /><br />First of all let 's get one thing straight Prince is a great musician and Music is the one area where Purple Rain excels . Even the score is mesmerising , and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it 's not and as such the movie has some problems.<br /><br />First of all is the horrendous acting / writing , Prince 's character " The Kid " is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere . A good loner character should at least have some talkative moments , unfortunately Prince 's character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it 's hard to believe that he 'd get the girl this way . Everything just seems a little off here , which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that 's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live , but we are n't ever allowed to get inside of it.<br /><br />A surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert . Prince and Morris 's lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here , which I guess makes sense from a business perspective , but it 's exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage , especially when the character 's back stories get pushed aside for it.<br /><br />So to sum it up : This is n't a very good movie .
0 By the numbers story of the Kid ( Prince ) , a singer , on his way to becoming a star . Then he falls in love with Apollonia ( Appolonia Kotero ) . But he has to deal with his wife - beating father ( Clarence Williams III ! ) and his own self - destructive behavior.<br /><br />I saw this in a theatre in 1984 . I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this movie--"Purple Rain " , " Let 's Get Crazy " , and " When Doves Cry " . The concert scenes in this movie are great -- full of energy and excitement . Unfortunately that 's a VERY small portion of the movie.<br /><br />The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before -- and much better too . The subplots are , to put in nicely , badly handled . The love triangle between The Kid , Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted . His wife beating father is needed for the story , but the scenes are so badly handled ( in acting and direction ) that I could n't believe it . The script is terrible -- lousy dialogue and some truly painful " comedy " routines . And there 's tons of misogyny here -- The Kid 's mother getting beaten ; The Kid hitting Appolonia and ( for no reason ) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river . Also Williams ' and Princes ' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly.<br /><br />The acting is where this movie REALLY fails . Appolonia is sweet and beautiful -- but no actor . And Prince is ( easily ) the WORST actor I 've ever seen . His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I could n't believe it . This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there are n't really that many . The " dramatic " scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through . They should have just made this a concert film . I give this a 2 - -only for the music .
0 Okay , I 'm not going to critique this film in depth . I note the many elogious reviews in advance of me , and as I generally like Maria de Medeiros , I have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment - and in such fashion nearly a year has passed . But each time I see that DVD on my shelf , I sense an inner groan . Anyway , let the elogious voices override me ! But for other cinephiles like me - beware.<br /><br />Expressed in simplest and gentlest terms , here 's my stance:<br /><br />The political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life - via newspapers I read daily in my local middle - European pub . At that time , I followed the newsreports , but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring . The reporters tended to report either in non - partisan terms , or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment . Those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through Paris , Berlin , Prague , and various places in the U.S. , all of whose issues I understand clearly at the time - but dictatorship or not , my papers tended to treat the govermentment of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as a well - fleshed out " evil empire " , to use flippant Star War terms.<br /><br />So , week after week , I read of disturbances , but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them , or evaluate the practices and social - economic impacts of the dictatorship , etc.<br /><br />So , in purchasing this film , I had at least two hopes : to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest , and to enjoy a well - conceived drama . This film gave me neither.<br /><br />The film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts . And the drama - well , as I said , I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portugues film industry , but - it was trite and shallow.<br /><br />I obtained my copy of the DVD from France - " Selection Official Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard " . The box shows smiling clean - shaven actors , the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny . After seeing the work , I wondered what the French could have thought of it - though as a shallow piece of " cinema verite ' " with sensitive ethnic content , I can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its " honesty " but ... <br /><br />Look at the back of the box : " Un regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution " - a warm regard ? Try describing Allende 's overthrown and murder with a a " warm regard " ! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968 ! Try it with the whole line - up of overthrows , and civil rebellions!<br /><br />Another review : Maria de Medeiros a renoue ' avec son pays , son enfance et son histoire . " Rubbish , rubbish , rubbish ! At least for me.<br /><br />I love Portugal . In all of Europe , Lisbon , Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities . But my love for a city and a country does n't flesh out a vacuous film . I 'll hang on to my ancient VHS tapes of Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile , I 'm stuck with a zone 2 by the above title that might as well go in the trash .
0 I know that some films ( I mean : European films ) , that are very bad films , are being regarded as great cinema by certain " critics " , only because they 're non - American . I saw the 8.1 IMDB score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals . Do n't let this fool you ! Unless you 're one of those people that likes mind - numbing films like this , and call it great art afterwards , skip it ! The film contains one hilarious scene after another ( a similar , Italian , film popped into my mind , the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE ( I prefer the sound of the sea ) ) . The problem with these films is that they 're not only boring , like some other strangely praised films , but that they almost play like camp . I mean , let 's face it , the acting is horrible ( I mean : soap opera - level ) , the story has not one surprise ( this has been done endless times before , connecting several storylines : SHORT CUTS , MAGNOLIA , PLAYING BY HEART , only much better ) , not one realistic character in it ( some true freak - seeing along the way , notice the hilarious zombie - like daughter ) , and so on and so on.<br /><br />As if that 's not enough , the film is 135 min . ( count it ! ) long , and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality . After a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence , well ... This is an insult to cinema , and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in " another " language , in this case Spanish . Strange world we live in ... 3/10
0 My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie . We were very upset that the JCC is bringing this movie to its Jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character Frankie is portrayed . We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out . We demanded out money back . We would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the JCC 's Achad program to apologize.<br /><br />We did not like seeing Frankie - a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager - as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nanny 's breasts.<br /><br />There was no point to Frankie 's character other than to say " hey , being mentally disabled is funny . " Challenges like Frankie 's are a serious matter . Families like mine are truly suffering.<br /><br />The screenwriter needs to explain herself . Does she know families with disabled kids ? Does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the JCC pool ?
0 I went on a visit to one of my relatives a while back , and we popped by a theatre , so we 'd thought we 'd go in and give this film a go . What a mistake ! This film is awful in every department . I 'd never heard of the film before , and literally everyone still has n't . No wonder , this is as rank as it gets . It 's a comedy , so it says , well the only thing funny is the ability , or lack of it , of the director to make such a film . Getting so close to Christmas , this should be titled how to under - cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hours - or however long it was , as I walked out . At the end of the film , you 'll come out feeling as though you 've been food poisoned on a sick turkey , and regret you wasted your time on such dribble . Who knows why such things get made . Some people had walked out from the theatre before the film was well over , and I blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier . It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent , and all that you come out and see is a poor TV movie that should be showed at 2 o'clock in the morning , in fact , it 's that bad , day time TV should n't be showing it . What else can a say ... probably not enough bad words could do it justice .
0 Just saw the movie this past weekend , I am upset , and disappointed with it . Basically , the movie tells you that immigrants , the ones from former Soviet Union especially , come to this country , bring everyone they can with them from the old country , and invade and take over what Americans have been working for . Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration , and a much worse way of telling people about it . That 's the main thing . Another thing , the overall writing , directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs . The actors did pretty well , but it was n't up to them save this bunch of crap . A few jokes were funny , but most were bad and cheesy . Could n't wait to get out of the theater , want my money back .
0 This is a movie which attempts a retelling of Thai history , set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya . I decided to watch this film because I thought it was along the lines of many Thai films I 've watched and enjoyed , one that has Thai actors speaking Thai and martial arts craziness . Well , it 's none of that . This film is shot entirely in English , is chock full of Anglo actors , and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad .... but not funny ! Who can we blame for this rubbish ? The acting , dialog , and most of the sets were quite bad . Some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club . The special effects were also mostly bad , but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect . It has one large , epic - style outdoor battle scene , where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume , but when we see the two armies collide in combat -- HA ! What a joke ! The film does feature a couple of beauties . What a pity they did n't show a little more skin . At least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate . Do n't bother .
0 THE KING MAKER will doubtless be a success in Thailand where the similar ( but superior ) ' The Legend of Suriyothai ' set box office records . The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest , pedestrian scripts and story development on film.<br /><br />The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma ( Gary Stretch ) whose vengeance for this father 's murderer drives him to shipwrecked , captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria ( Cindy Burbridge ) with the consent of her father Phillipe ( John Rhys - Davies ) , a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses . There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong ( Dom Hetrakul ) , after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness , are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards , only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan ( Yoe Hassadeevichit ) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat ( Oliver Pupart ) to take over the rule of Siam . Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families ( Tong 's wife and children and Fernando 's now firm love affair with Maria ) with the expected consequences.<br /><br />The acting ( with the exception of John Rhys - Davies ) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp . The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog , making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles . The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas . But if it is visual splendor you 're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching . It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions . It is just the basics that are missing . Grady Harp
0 Evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything . I am not sure how much John Rys - Daves got , but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie . The special effects were worse then effects from the 1950 's B movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse . As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion . The English was terribly accented and I think no one could really even speak English they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both " life - like " and real .
0 This movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera , sound , film , sets , music , costumes ... but drum - roll , Gary Stretch spoke ! I do n't know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script , but would say it was both . Considering the casting of him in this role , I found it difficult to root for him even to the very end . I wished he 'd have died in battle or one of the sword / knife scuffles.<br /><br />Then , the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king did n't have dinner and sex with his Queen ? Pretty lame . And to go to the extreme to kill her own son ? And to then push up her lover as succeeding King ? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes , but the manner in which this was all presented was farcical.<br /><br />I do n't recognize Gary Stretch from anything else , but he was dreadful . I read another user 's comments about audio being dubbed , but do n't think his was dubbed ... after all , he speaks English , right ? It really was awful . The lines were read right off the coroner 's table ... flat - line . It could be he just does n't have the voice to carry tone fluctuations.<br /><br />Aside from this , I did watch it to the end , so the movie had at least an " interest . " It could have been more if the script / lines and casting had been given more work . The scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else . The cast and story were all secondary . I give the film crew a 10 .
0 Unfortunately , this has been showing on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so . It 's complete rubbish acting . As another member said , this movie is a good example of ' how not to act . ' I have n't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time . The actors ( can you call them ' actors ' ? ) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog . I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is , you would have to see the movie ... but that would be akin to torture.<br /><br />I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines , and the rest of the cast with their accents ( fake or contrived ) is equally heinous . Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty , yes , but good lord was her accent terrible . Mix that with her ( lack of ) acting and you have a disaster . She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl . Oh my , we just got to the scene where the leading lady 's lover says " Really me ? " after a forced crying scene from her . Laughable . No , really , I just laughed out loud.<br /><br />The sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film . Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice ( minus the actors).<br /><br />The old magic potion lady ? What ? ! Another member mentioned the ' modern ' love song that was in the movie . Totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.<br /><br />I understand the movie was considered ' Big Budget ' in Thailand at the time of it 's production . I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie . Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good ( or even mediocre ) film.<br /><br />I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10 , but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating . 2 out of 10 .
0 The King Maker is a film about a series of real ( citation needed ) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable , the movie still fails to impress the viewer . The acting , in particular , was extremely poor . Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents , both real and fake , are extremely irritating . The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson . The movie could n't even capture that sort of regal and century - old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.<br /><br />Final say ? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air , but the execution was extremely poor and the actors could n't even give natural bursts of emotion . In short , the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script .
0 This was the worst acted movie I 've ever seen in my life . No , really . I 'm not kidding . All the " based on a true story / historical references " aside , there 's no excuse for such bad acting . It 's a shame , because , as others have posted , the sets & costumes were great.<br /><br />The sound track was typical " asian - style " music , although I could n't figure out where the " modern " love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria . I do n't know who wrote & sang that beautiful song , but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones was transported to the 1500s.<br /><br />The Hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the Kwik - n - EZ battle scenes.<br /><br />But the acting . Oh , so painfully sad . Lines delivered like a bad junior high play . If Gary Stretch had donned a potato costume for the County 4H Fair he may have been more believable . Towards the end he sounded more like a Little Italy street thug . At times I half expected him to yell out " Adrian ! " or even " You wanna piece of me?!".<br /><br />Favourite line : When the queen says to her lover ( after barfing on the floor ) " I 'm going to have a baby . " He responds " A child ? " I expected her to retort " No , jackass , a chair leg ! Duh . "
0 This is just a bad movie . With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better . It almost were . With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek , hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan , battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger ... , music almost like in , say , Conan ... etc . Almost . But in the end it 's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it . Maybe apart of John Rhys - Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before - mentioned Crouching Tiger ... I am really ashamed of poor old John . He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better . So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else .
0 Up to this point , Gentle Rain was the movie I found the worst in history . It has been supplanted by this ' blockbuster ' out of Asia . It has one " star " and it is John Rhys Davies . He is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling , magical flying baddie he is cast here . The rest of these people could n't act their way out of a junior high school play . No clichés were missed in the dialogue , and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible.<br /><br />It is fairly easy to see that somebody in Asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at . Or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit . My guess is that any career with this movie in it 's credential < br /><br />Do yourself a major favor and do n't watch this movie . A hundred Thanksgivings could n't consume this turkey.<br /><br />The one funny scene was unintentional . The brother of the King appears on the scene . The king ? A handsome , older , short Asian actor . ( Bad actor . ) The brother ? A six foot European . ( Also a bad actor . ) No excuses were made for this . They just expected us not to notice that this poor man 's Jet Li 's brother was a wannabe Pierce Brosnan in a cheap dimestore " Injun " wig right out of an old western movie from the forties .
0 Warning Spoiler . . . I have to agree with you , it was almost there . This was such a bad movie , about such and interesting true story . It had such promise , but the acting was ridiculous at best . Some sets were beautiful and realistic . Others are something out of a theme park . I found myself laughing as I watched , what was suppose to be , serious scenes . I really wanted to like this movie , but I could n't . The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the " King " dying . I liked the Queens ' punishment . And , the final shot made a beautiful picture , though . There are so many better movies to watch . I do n't recommend this .
0 The movie was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater , it failed miserably.<br /><br />Apparently the story writer just do n't hold water . Something was definitely missing . In my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past . Accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment.<br /><br />The movie just lack any substance . The only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story . And a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time , such as the meaning of sacrifice , nationalism , etc . It is called the central theme.<br /><br />The movie fails to answer , why would I watch it anyway?<br /><br />At least some strange legendary Flying Elephants , psychic king , or the eccentric king such as " The King and I " would have been lovely , something would have added greatly to the movies ' appeal . I guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie . < br /><br />Once you got the appeal , then the story is the next thing we concentrate on . In marketing terms , we call it " must see " . Upon hearing the title of the movie people would say , Oh , I must see it . Now where 's the appeal in Kingmaker ? Why not just redo the title and call it , " How NOT to be a King ? " and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days , to the style of " Dr. Strangelove " . That would have been much more interesting . Narrative - like experiences of the foibles of the King from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny . < br /><br />Most movies today have that " must see " appeal , such as Spiderman , Men X , these titles speak for themselves . If they do n't have familiar characters , some other movies such as , The Island , had an appeal itself when the advertising asks " Do you still believe there is an Island ? " . < br /><br />Or for the movie , retitled " How NOT to be a King " might ask the question , " So do you still WANT to be a King ? " < br /><br />Parhat
0 Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras . By the last few years of the Thirties , swing - style big bands were recording the year 's biggest popular hits . The Swing Era , also called the Big Band Era , has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949 . Although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the Swing Era began , Benny Goodman 's engagement at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream America 's youth . When Goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society - style dance music that his band had been playing , the youth in the audience went wild . That was the beginning , but , since radio , live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena , it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts . In Hollywood Hotel , the appearance of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste ( the film was in production only a year and a half or so after Goodman 's Palomar Ballroom engagement ) . There are a few interesting musical moments here and there in Hollywood Hotel , but except for Benny Goodman and His Orchestra 's " Sing , Sing , Sing , " there is n't a lot to commend . Otherwise , the most interesting musical sequences are the opening " Hooray for Hollywood " parade and " Let That Be a Lesson to You " production number at the drive - in restaurant . The film is most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing .
0 This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie . Face it , you ca n't . Because that way there 's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot , have meaningless transitions , trite , unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd.<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie , really I did ; I like lots of crappy movies . But once I 've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY , DEAR LORD , WHY ? more than a few times , I really ca n't take it any more.<br /><br />Also , I would love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene .
0 This movie was horrible.<br /><br />They did n't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly . It was a definite sleeper . You 'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but D - Wars surprises you with even a let down in that department . < br /><br />Also , the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick . And I seriously mean that.<br /><br />I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad ! ! ! Please , whatever you do people , do n't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D - Wars .
0 This movie is likely the worst movie I 've ever seen in my life -- surpassing the previous most god - awful movie , " Spawn of Slithis , " which I saw when I was about 10.<br /><br />Bad acting , stilted and ridiculous dialog , incomprehensible plot , mishmashed cut scenes , even the music was annoying . Did I leave anything out ? Well , the special effects were n't bad -- but CGI does not a decent movie make.<br /><br />I ca n't believe I actually spent money to see this movie . If anyone has the contact info for Hyung - rae Shim ( the director ) , please forward it to my user name " at gmail , " and I 'll contact him to personally demand a refund .
0 I went into this movie with high hopes . Normally , I 'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are * always * fun to watch , or so I thought . I 'll list the good parts of this movie : -The creature effects . All of the creatures were well - done , their movements were realistic , and they fit into the other imagery well . To be honest , the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1 . Now , the bad things : -The acting . Good Lord , I 've seen bad acting , but this movie takes the cake . Not a single one of the characters is even * close * to believable . It 's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try - outs from it . I tried very hard not to giggle too loud , cause I did n't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre , but the acting really was THAT BAD . -The storyline : The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish . You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film . The plot holes , of course , are complimentary with the cheese . This is probably one of the most clichéd , not thought - out , and outright dumbest stories I 've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel . -The dialogue : This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can , at every chance they possibly can . In this world , it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low - budget creature movies . It is the world of cheese and cliché . -The special effects . While the creature effects were downright awesome , the special effects fail miserably . Yes , they are better than those seen in other movies , but a lot of it is in the presentation . And this movie has no presentation whatsoever . It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show , to be honest . To sum up : Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money . The concept is good , but it is trapped in the bad directing , acting , dialogue , and cheesiness of the film . Wait til the next big monster movie comes out . It 's got ta be better than this , cause Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible .
0 How this movie got made with a supposedly $ 70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me . The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish . Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before . No one seems to be grounded in the real world . The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud ... but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down . The hero 's hair probably should 've gotten its own credit , it was so oddly attention- grabbing ... not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic . Finally , for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles , this film is shockingly boring . What a shame ! If you do see this , your mind will be constantly racing , thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them . Sadly , it would n't have taken much .
0 First off , I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen . Its not even the low budget SCI - Fi channel movie , its just awful . Me and my friend who love action movies , Independence day , Jurassic Park , LotR , etc . went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons , mindless entertainment . All we got was a mindless hour and a half . The CG was not as bad as I was expecting , but the plot is so awful along with the acting , it made up for it . Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years ... Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire ? No , The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes , but with magic , and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes ) it just gets ridiculous . The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail . Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience ) , and ca nt believed we spent money on this . The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest . I 've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian , The Cave , Spider , and others , but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour , watch this.<br /><br />Story : 1/10 CG : 5/10 Acting:3/10<br /><br />I do n't drink ... but it would have helped before watching this movie
0 I went in to see D - War on a whim and with very low expectations . The movie failed to meet them.<br /><br />I do n't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire ? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent . This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath , all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla.<br /><br />A shape - shifting mystic warrior from Korea , curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess . A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed 's excellent " paranormal division " - which has gone unremarked up to this point . Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims " I never meant for this to happen . " A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who " died like star - crossed lovers . " Mystic pendants , faceless hordes of robotic soldiers ( that owe a lot to Peter Jackson 's orcs ) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.<br /><br />The dialogue is appalling , the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was , to be honest , tedious . However , for me the crowning moment was at the end , after the finale , when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang ! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing " Ran " with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa.<br /><br />In short , a self indulgent , lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non - sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so - serious movie goer . I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video , but I 'm not even sure that it 's worth that much .
0 ... there 's no one else watching the movie . My husband and I went to watch it last night . It 's just a small theater , but there 's usually a decent amount of people there . Not this time ! My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night ! Now we know why.<br /><br />The movie was by far one of the worst I 've ever seen . Yes , the CG was good , but that was it . The acting , script & dialog , directing , editing , etc . was God - awful ! Since we were alone in the room , we felt free to talk during the movie . That is , we talked about how bad it was , that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , Godzilla , Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings . It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Sauron 's army.<br /><br />The creatures were ridiculous . You ca n't just introduce legions of dino / dragon / lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation . The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters , but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies , not in an hour and a half.<br /><br />The scene transitions are horrible . I did n't fall asleep during the movie , but even though it was an overly simple plot , I found myself getting lost in the plot holes.<br /><br />The characters were caucasian Americans , but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the script.<br /><br />The final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie ... failed . Ethan did n't cry when Sarah died ... though he had n't known her for very long during THIS life anyways . He did n't seem too upset to be left in " Mordor " , not knowing where he was or how to get back . We could n't for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either , but if he was n't upset we should n't be either.<br /><br />Oh , and why did the dress that Sarah 's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth ? One more thing ... all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job . Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife . Jack does this as well . Then why does Ethan get screwed ? He 's left alone , without the girl , without a map / compass / helicopter to help him get back . What 's he supposed to do ? Send smoke signals ? And IF he gets back home , does he just go back to his job ? He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this movie . We only stayed til the end because we 'd paid for it , but as soon as the credits hit , we were out the door .
0 Everyone does things that they later regret . Things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession . Things that although seem rational at the time , later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity.<br /><br />For some people it is signing the note for the new Hummer , for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker , for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cash.<br /><br />For me it was a film.<br /><br />D - War : Dragon Wars In hindsight , I should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title . But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact , and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby , I really wanted this film to work . Sadly , by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory , fifteen minutes into the picture , I had the sudden , sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film . And worse : I knew just how badly every point would all suck.<br /><br />Let me be perfectly clear here , the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is.<br /><br />As for knowing all the twists of movie , I was wrong . In the spirit of the old Godzilla films , whose scales this one is not worthy to fill , it conveniently sprouted extra sub - plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue.<br /><br />It was infested with close calls , miraculous escapes , and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst.<br /><br />This film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget . And lots of liquor.<br /><br />Let me try to explain.<br /><br />Imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest - looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade : First take the rasta - talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals.<br /><br />Next , take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise ( You can even call him Ethan as a " subtle " nod to the Mission Impossible franchise . ) and give them lots of film noir narration , so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading - pool depths of their thoughts.<br /><br />Finally add a raspy - voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras , angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong , and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles.<br /><br />Now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine . When you return , puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi - gelatinous.<br /><br />At several points during this picture , I found myself saying out loud , " Make the bad movie stop , " and breaking into tears.<br /><br />To call this a B - movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion . After summer school , and a lot of physical therapy , it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it.<br /><br />In short , if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn , and the need to punish yourself for hideous , unspoken sins against humanity , Dragon Wars might just be the film for you .
0 I knew it was n't gunna work out between me and D - wars from the moment we met . First its title was lazy . D war . Like writing out Dragon was too much for them . Also ... you really ca n't be that blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey . Blue Monkey can do whatever the hell it wants . < br /><br />The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story 's insane progression . Here 's the film , dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks , flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows . Old shop keep reveals several terrible truths . That Bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god . tells the kid that he 's a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry . Shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he 's a 500 year old Asian . < br /><br />fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl . cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose . Why ? Continue on dear reader if you have the Balls.<br /><br />so Sarah , the reincarnated lover , has her own flashbacks . I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing . Its a Korean legend and she 's reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese . Later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt , she calls the police cause it looks like she 's having a heart attack . See , in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she 's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she 's crazy . I have a new phobia now , and its that if i 'm ever in trouble the first responders will just assume i 'm crazy . < br /><br />I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress , Dwar . There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr ( Dreamy Reporter ) is in a café ' with sassy black friend . In the scenes prior Miffed Near divinity Bauraki has killed an elephant , slithered through a suburb and killed one of Sarah 's friends . See , people were afraid to come out after 9 - 11 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for . Business as usual , no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on . If i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win . < br /><br />After being given a satisfying dragon on Helicopter battle my cruel lover Dwar treats me to a pi$$ and vinegar filled scene to end it all with . Bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under LA i guess . They do n't really say but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up , yep dragon palace . some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestle / make love whatever . And i 'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere . Maybe you think i 'm blowing it out of proportion , i 'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly ... there ! Few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god , sets Baurki on fire , Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with Dragon - god , dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits ... thank god < br /><br />Now our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times . There was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars . I 'll call him Tuskan Shredder . He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful . He could walk through a wall in a scene where that was n't helpful . He could go in your dreams when that would n't do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered . He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry . I like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises . < br /><br />The actors for the most part were great ... if great somehow meant terrible . Jason Behr , whom i thought was awesome in Roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that 's pretentious , spacey and Patrick Dempsey"ish".<br /><br />The one thing i love about this filthy prostitute Dwars is its lead actor , Bauraki . That Giant snake acted his heart out . I 'd dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi - god of evil then John Barrymore was at playing Richard the III or Hamlet . There was emotion in every scene , stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast . When he ate an elephant i felt like no one past , present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling . He was more then an actor , he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project . Yes damn it , my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake . I 've got the balls to admit that , do you?<br /><br />Here 's to hoping Bauraki get 's more work and is n't type cast , that Jason Behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare , and that i never have to watch Blue Monkey again . < br /><br />So , D - War its over . I want my CDs back and let 's just be friends
0 Hilarious , laugh out loud moments ... and yet not a comedy . I particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the " filthy bum " who then shouts after them in anger " you filthy bums " , I mean wow , someone 's online degree in literature is paying off ! The worst script imaginable , with plot introductions in an instant , ridiculous movement in the story , ZERO character development ( even between the characters who meet .. it 's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years ) dodgy voice over with added echo effects , and plot holes .. oh God are there plot holes ! ! To be honest I write this not even having watched the entire thing , but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we 've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of ... well ... use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence !
0 I 'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in IMDb rating system . this movie was horrible . It was very badly acted , the story was poorly written , the action was unbelievable . I doubt even the Salvation Army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film . I wo n't even write any plot spoilers because the movie just is n't good enough for plot spoilers . To write comments on the plot would be pointless . If I were to compare this movie , I 'd have to compare it to Reign of Fire , however although I did n't like Reign of Fire either , that movie at least was better than this one . < br /><br />Some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done . The only reason I did n't was because I simply did n't think to do it . I was hoping for a feast of CGI and fighting masterfully done , but that is n't what happened . The martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash - back scene , very disappointing . The CGI was not done well either . One scene comes to mind . During one of the earlier tank battles , the troops are firing away at ...... nothing . Someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys . I 'm also thinking the bad guy 's voice was dubbed by the voice - over of Imotep from The Mummy movies . Had that same scraggly echoing thing going on . ( Someone owed some royalties , here ? ) Since I mentioned the fight scene , I 'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler , but only to the purists I suppose.<br /><br />Don't go see it , do n't buy the DVD when it comes out either . You have been warned .
0 I am a guy , who loves guy movies ... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects . All of this happened , however , this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />The story was standard , but the portrayal of the story was terrible . The scene transitions were the worst I have ever seen . Why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger ? The serpent dragon 's actions itself was very poorly written ... and the serpent dragon 's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie , several times the main characters should have died.<br /><br />The director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times , this movie was obviously not watched after it was made , I love movies , but had to force myself to finish watching it , thank god I did not buy this , I borrowed it from a friend.<br /><br />Do not buy this , do not rent it , just watch discovery channel ... much more exciting .
0 { rant start } I did n't want to believe them at first , but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill . After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie " Gwoemul " ( aka " The Host " ) of 2006 - - which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B - movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic , even though their budgets ( mainly spent on special effects ) have become more and more fantastic . Do South Korean movie - makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill , which their industry has built up since the 1999 break - out film " Shiri / Swiri " , by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did ? { rant end}<br /><br />The only " reason " I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian - styled dragon I have seen to date , for the final scenes . Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 " Dragonheart " , the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons . Remember " Dungeons & Dragons " in 2000 ? Has n't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use , but how WELL you use it ? I hope there are more ( and better ) Korean legends they can use , because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.<br /><br />In short , I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem " Arirang " being played at the very end . As a creature feature , I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it , but I 've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting ( just less dragons ) .
0 This is the sorriest collection of clichés , strung together on a straight line , with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting I 've seen in a long time . Canibalising scenes from Star Wars , Reign of Fire , Godzilla , Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter , it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence . Was this movie good ? It was n't a movie at all!<br /><br />Even if it does n't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy , the movie does offer some laughs . The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films . Gandalf can be funny talking Korean , the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja - bing , or whatever his name was.<br /><br />Bottom line : any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers , not on the director / writer . Shame on you , Shim !
0 My original review of this film was simply the word sh*t written 2000 times over . Although this was a very accurate critique , I felt my review should be a little more descriptive.<br /><br />I will start with the lead actress ; her facial expression does n't change once in this film , she does n't show fear , happiness or depression . Her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she do n't know jack . She is an emotionless husk who I 'm guessing has had too much botox . Her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another . The lead actor , whose hair demands more attention than he did , was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril.<br /><br />The only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing , storyline and inaccuracies in plot . I have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie . The is no development in character , they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe a real person would.<br /><br />This film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that I could n't even laugh . I believe I now have a brain tumour from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways I could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior . If I bought this on DVD I would smash the DVD to pieces , burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure . DON'T WATCH THIS FILM !
0 First off I 'd like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere to be seen in this film . What 's a movie without Sam Niel . Did anyone see Event Horizon . D - Wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly is n't . Nope , no Sam Niel , no good movie . I recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent D - Wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a Sam Niel film- apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of Sam Niel movies i recommend < br /><br />-jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red October -event horizon -not jurassic park three < br /><br />overall D - Wars is a pile
0 Whatever his name is ( the writer and director ) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again . This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time . Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they 're actually sort of good . Not this one . This was so bad I got angry . Seriously . A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script . What a waste . ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all , the CGI was barely acceptable , the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was , it 's like he just decided , " I want this to happen and this to happen , but I do n't care how we got there , just shoot it and put it in . Whatever , I 'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose , if anyone calls for me , I 'm not here . " Shame on you whatever your name is . Shame on you .
0 I hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity . Hyung - Rae Shim is lucky that bad film - making is n't a capital crime or he 'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster . I 'm amazed that this film had a $ 75 m budget , but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop , that Shim will hopefully , never get to make another movie the rest of the life and , therefore , not waste any more of filmgoers time . I would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now.<br /><br />With the effects resources available to them , a great film could have been made with this budget . As usual , the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story . " Transformers " was another visual feast with a weak script , but this makes it look like " Citizen Kane " .
0 Based on the Korean legend , unknown creatures will return and devastate the planet . Reporter Ethan Kendrick is called in to investigate the matter , and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl , stricken with a mysterious illness , named Sarah is suppose to help him . The Imoogi makes its way to Los Angeles , wreaking havoc and destruction . With the entire city under arms , will Ethan and Sarah make it in time to save the people of Los Angeles ? Written by Anonymous I think he should have included the following < br /><br />This is the worst movie i have ever seen the best actor in the whole thing was the CG dragon and overall it s u c k - ed i am p i s s - ed at not only with the people who made it but myself for watching save yourself the time read a book or something maybe a little Dr Seuss that should be more stimulating.<br /><br />no wonder the guy is anonymous sorry for the format this site has a lot of rules this is the only way i could get this out without adding more
0 This movie was so very badly written . The characters had no depth . They should have never made a movie of this . My 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay then Hyung - rae Shim.<br /><br />The only actor that did n't suck was the zoo guard . He was the only funny and believable one of the lot.<br /><br />I love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt , but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2 . Number 1 being Demonicus.<br /><br />For those of you who actually thought this was a good movie , you are in serious need of brain surgery.<br /><br />Most of the creatures in the movie were n't even dragons ... so why did they call D - war ?
0 this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed . the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made . being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money . i rented it so i wo n't complain too much about what i paid , but it was a couple hours that i 'll never get back . plot holes abound . terrible acting all across the board . i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie , life is too short . if your friends want to watch this , run away . i ca n't stress enough how bad this film was . < br /><br />where the hell did the second dragon come from ? why did n't he show up sooner ? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago ?
0 I knew it would be , but I gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun . Anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that I 'm pretty easy to please . I really did n't think I 'd end up feeling this negatively towards it.<br /><br />The plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can   become one with   a good dragon   or something   I do n't know . It was so stupid , I did n't bother to put much effort into retaining it.<br /><br />It features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts . So many of the events just felt totally random and sudden.<br /><br />I assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it 's trying to be so grand and epic , yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly . I feel like I 've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball . The film is like a punch in the face . It does n't take much time at all to establish characters or drama . Imagine the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy in 90 minutes   You could have most of the epic battle sequences , but there would be absolutely no buildup and you 'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles . That was the case with Dragon Wars   90 minutes of me not giving a crap , waiting for it to be over.<br /><br />Fantastic CGI with some okay directing , but horrible acting , speedy pacing , and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds . I probably would have loved it when I was 6 .
0 I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie , as I did n't think it was going to be well done . The kids , ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it , so I caved . I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought , but was still a far cry from the book . The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old 's understanding and sense of humor . I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place . I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies do n't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the " silly " or " stupid " choices .
0 Squeamish 11-year - old Luke Benward ( as Billy " Worm Boy " Forrester ) moves to a new town . At his new school , young Benward is picked on by the other boys . They put worms in his thermos . Getting his gag reflex under control , Benward tosses a worm on freckle - faced bully Adam Hicks ( as Joe Guire ) . Benward bets he can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation ! < br /><br />Tall , teased Hallie Kate Eisenberg ( as Erika " Erk " Tansy ) uses her archery skills to help Benward . Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises , " No worms were harmed in the making of this movie . " In a related note , SCTV star Andrea Martin has one funny scene . " How to Eat Fried Worms " is loosely based on Thomas Rockwell 's popular novel . Pre - teen kids into gross - outs should enjoy the film.<br /><br / > * * * * How to Eat Fried Worms ( 8/25/06 ) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward , Adam Hicks , Hallie Kate Eisenberg , Alexander Gould
0 I was bored , around 10 pm , so I watched this movie . And I could not stop laughing . Everything was so ridiculous . The way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up . One of the kids had a ring , that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years . It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.<br /><br />It 's pretty hard to take little kids seriously , especially when it has to do with eating worms . They act like everything is such a big deal , like if Billy ( the main character ) does n't eat the worms then the world will end.<br /><br />This is a good movie for little kids ( excluding the fact that a 5 year old says ' penis ' ) , but not for teens or adults who do n't want to waste their time .
0 I have to admit I did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching . I watched it with a room full of kids , who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor . The director , Bob Dolman , seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that I grew up with . THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR KIDS ! Besides the fact that the content is so crude , the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it . What a waste of a perfectly good story . If you read the book when you were younger and loved it , then do n't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry . Buy your kids the book instead .
0 i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing . my first reaction was , ' oh god not again ! ' . it 's so hip to play a retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable . for some reason , though , i stayed and watched it ' til the end . maybe it was my faith in the actors , hoping they 'd give me something to cheer about.<br /><br />and surely , ken and helena can act . also , the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a point.<br /><br />helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character . jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity . then again she has a soft side that 's just looking for love . the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh 's character ... this was a triumph of acting , the movie itself is nothing unique.<br /><br />see if you are an acting student ... if you 're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one . it 's sean penn serious ! oh my , that was a bit harsh it does feature a couple jokes ... not for escapists though .
0 Spoiler ! ! I love Branagh , love Helena Bonham - Carter , loved them together in " Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein " - but THIS -<br /><br />I can understand an actor 's desire to stretch , to avoid the romantic stereotype . Well , they did , but really - the script droned on , Bonham - Carter 's clothes were tres chic , and the occasional speeded - up " madcap " sequence could have been an outtake from a Beatles ' movie , or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh - In.<br /><br />I never got the point - other commenters say the Branagh character was a dreamer . I never felt that . He was a loser , and not very bright , and certainly not endearing . The business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch . Certainly not amusing.<br /><br />Bonham - Carter 's realistic ( one supposes ) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in " Full Monty." < br /><br />The poetic ending , with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated . Was there a choir of angels , or merely a soundtrack?<br /><br />Go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it . Donate this to PBS.<br /><br / >
0 I still do n't know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing . This " film " was n't worth the Memorex DVD - R it was burned on ; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents ' camcorder . This is by far the worst movie ever made . I truly , from the bottom of my heart , want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.<br /><br />So apparently , it 's supposed to be bad on purpose ; However , if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo - doo , you 'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick . The actors attempt dramatic kick - ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine.<br /><br />The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg . The camera angles are awful . The story is C - movie at best-- the plot is n't even good enough to be considered B - movie caliber . The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty , but is crap like everything else . Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies . Plus , the techno score is annoying ... not because it 's techno , but because it 's NON - STOP . That 's right , the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME , acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is . I do n't care what the disclaimer claims , I do n't buy it . BOTS was not made this bad on purpose , because it takes itself WAY too serious for what it was : a joke.<br /><br />This " film " was very low - budget . But that is no excuse for its record - setting suck factor . Great films are born of substance , not budget . BOTS had neither.<br /><br />Allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time : if I were having a three - way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai came on , I 'd be out of there quicker than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision.<br /><br />Undoubtedly , some people will try to defend the movie . Two , maybe three . They 'll say , " it 's grindhouse chop - socky ! " or " cheesy in a good way ! " or " it 's so bad , it 's good ! " Those people are idiots . A movie is either good , or it 's bad . There 's no such thing as a good bad movie . But there ARE such things as idiots that like crappy movies . Do n't get me wrong ; there are lots of cornball not - to - be - taken - seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining . Slither is one . BOTS is not.<br /><br />This suckfest runs about an hour and a half , and in my humble opinion , it 's 90 minutes too long . The best thing about this " film " is the DVD cover , so next time you 're near the Wal - Mart DVD bargain bin , take a look at it-- DON'T TOUCH IT , just look-- and quietly walk away .
0 I have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget . Bad acting , horrible cinematography , and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie . The WWF style cinemtography will make you cry ... where 's the tripod ? ! The filmakers aimed high , but sorely missed their mark .
0 Trash / bad movies usually ai n't bad because I will find them enjoyable . This one is so bad that I am out of words to describe it - its below " bad " . There is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie . Needless to say , the instruction and a dozen of beer could n't help me seat through the entire film . One tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent . Obviously . this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this DVD.<br /><br />If you are considering renting this one , put it down ! If you are thinking of buying , Do nt think ! If you unlucky to have this dvd , do nt play it , throw it in trash bin immediately .
0 There are no spoilers in this review . There 's nothing to spoil.<br /><br />No plot , nothing ; most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch , but this did n't even do that . Clips , three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ... OK , so perhaps they were short on production time , but they 'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely . What a waste of time.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this got made , in fact . Scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes , but somehow this got through .... <br /><br />Thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode .
0 The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald . Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week , Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them . The latest episode when our favorite grumpy , Jesus - loving Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head . The must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity . For shame , Scrubs . They 've made mistakes like this before . I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her . I try not to notice these things , but my favorite show needs to step it up .
0 I thought it was not the best re - cap episode I 've every seen ( though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment ... *sigh * ) . It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle " Coxism State " he is in these days , if only for brief moments . I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character 's hair ( or height , in case of JD ) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes . I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase / or is that Matthew Perry ? prat - fall induced chemical slide ( already acknowledged on Conan ) . A little side note , the song ( now stuck in my head ) from the janitor - induced dance montage was " Diner " by Martin Sexton .
0 But , lets face it ... it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me.<br /><br />The show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups . I get a new season , and just power through them like I have 2-days to live . I like the idea of wrapping it up , but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following:<br /><br />Dr . Cox is n't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes , only explanation I can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re - shoot the beginning.<br /><br />and that my friends , is why the hell cox is bald.<br /><br />Anyways , the show is awesome ... bring on the 7th season .
0 I debated as to whether or not I should tick the spoiler box . Since 99 % of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of Scrubs it probably does n't come under the category of a spoiler.<br /><br />Clip shows . Grrr . We all knew Friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows ... and five and a half years into Scrubs they 've gone and fallen down that hole.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the writers just could n't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves " let 's show the other funny stuff . " It did n't work.<br /><br />For starters , showing all the times that people have fallen down is n't funny when taken out of context . It 's not funny to see Todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know WHY he was dangling by his banana hammock.<br /><br />Second , for what was supposed to be a compilation of JD 's fantasies , one was Turk 's dream , another also was n't his fantasy , although I forget which.<br /><br />And that 's the problem . This episode is totally forgettable . We 've seen all these things before . And the collection of clips of people dancing ? Why ? That 's not funny.<br /><br />Finally , I must admit two of my favourite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation ... Dr . Cox realising that Ben died ... and JD telling him how proud of him he is.<br /><br />But even seeing those moments again did n't save the episode . The summary says it all.<br /><br />Worst episode ever . Bill Lawrence , PLEASE do n't let your show go the same way as Friends , keep it fresh , keep it funny ... or wrap it up .
0 When ' My Deja Vu , My Deja Vu ' aired last season , I was pleased . Scrubs , I thought , is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip - show concept . Instead of replaying footage , they 're replaying jokes in a self - aware manner , and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong . One season later , they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do , the clip show ... and it looked like it was put together by the work - experience kid . Dr Cox 's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together , as it does n't appear again until ' My Long Goodbye ' some 4 episodes later . I ca n't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well - constructed sitcom . Who knows why it was slotted there , it just seemed lazy and out of place , reminding me ( largely ) of episodes that have aired within the past year.<br /><br />Three second clips jammed together with background music is a DVD extra for a ( very ) rainy day , not an episode of prime - time television .
0 Truly bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen .... ever.<br /><br />They tried to make up for it by giving it the , ' we know we are doing this ' routine . That would have been funny if it were n't for the fact that ' The Simpsons ' had already done it . And it still would n't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place.<br /><br />The flashbacks took place as part of the usual character 's ( mainly J.D 's ) fantasies . The flashbacks were n't even of actual events that occurred , just compilations of say , J.D falling over or , i do n't know .... Elliott falling over . If I wanted to watch a Scrubs compilation i 'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life.<br /><br />Scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit - coms have to , and it disappoints me , they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this . < br /><br />I was hoping that scrubs would n't have to be that kind of sit - com.<br /><br />And just as a passing thought , why the hell was Dr . Cox bald ?
0 Whoa boy.<br /><br />Ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him ? Well they exist , in many forms . But have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who did n't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone 's praises about how much of an artistic " genius " he is ? Well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene ( I know they 're everywhere and I do n't even follow the local scene ) , or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe.<br /><br />The premise is good and , honestly , it 's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that 's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary . We are made to follow two bands , The Brian Jamestown Massacre , lead by Anton , and The Dandy Warhols , lead by Courtney . I 've heard of The Dandy Warhols before watching this movie ... not so the Brian Jamestown Massacre . Why ? Well from this documentary 's perspective , because The Brian Jamestown Massacre 's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry . However , instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed , the focus becomes much more on Anton and his insanity.<br /><br />Because , see , Anton is a " genius . " Because he plays rock music . He really " understands the evolution of music " ... because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments . His music is considered " post - modern retro but the future " ... because it 's rock music . He wants to bring out a " revolution " ... through rock music . Okay so let 's face it ... twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids I 'd care to watch a documentary about.<br /><br />The documentary itself does n't really lend itself to showcasing any of Anton 's talent , because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we do n't really have the time to focus on that . So instead we watch Anton , " the genius " , the socio - maniacal loser , be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music . Whether he did or not I wo n't know , because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it . What I do know is that then we 're left with a story about some self - centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a God of music and doing nothing to back it up . Why even bother watching that ? People like Anton do n't deserve the attention they seek , the hope and admiration of all those different people , and especially a post - failure paean to lost potential . This movie plays like a two - hour rough - cut VH1 special for a reason : he goes on and on about the music , but it 's all about the image and the attention . Look at the guy , look at how he dresses , look at how he acts , look at how he tries to create controversy because he ca n't afford marketing.<br /><br />Honestly the only interesting character in this film is Joel , and that 's because of anyone in this documentary , Joel is the only person who seems to have any fun . Maybe it 's because he 's the tambourine man . The rest of them are all " rock stars " ! They deserve our attention , and admiration , and interest , and engagements ! They are out there to " save rock and roll . " Do you remember when The White Stripes were supposed to " save rock and roll " ? Yeah , that was because of Anton , and it 's " selfish of them not to mention me ( Anton ) as an inspiration . " What a load . People like Anton are best left forgotten . This documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull -- because music execs have to deal with people like Anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless . Thanks a lot , Anton . Your antics ruined music for EVERYONE you touched , whatever the opinion to the contrary is . And if people " in the know " about Anton disagree and he really was a genius , it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0 Actress Ruth Roman 's real - life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco jump - started this all - star Warner Bros. salute to patriotism and song . Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love - hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny Air Force Corporal ( Ron Hagerthy , who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle ) . Seems the Corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he 's off to battle when actually he 's part of a airplane carrier crew , flying to and from Honolulu ( you 'd think she 'd be happy he was staying out of harm 's way , but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies ) . Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so , and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant . Roman is also here , looking glamorous , while James Cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone . Jane Wyman sings , too , in a hospital bedside reprise following Doris Day 's lead , causing one to wonder , " Did they run out of sets ? " For undemanding viewers , an interesting flashback to another time and place . Still , the low - rent production and just - adequate technical aspects render " Starlift " strictly a second - biller . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 It 's nothing more than a weird coincidence that I decided to watch STARLIFT on the 59th anniversary of the day in June 1950 when President Truman 's ordered US forces into the Korean War . STARLIFT , you see , is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea . But you 'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name ' Korea ' mentioned . We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there 's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured . Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute America 's men in uniform . Released in December 1951 by Warner Brothers , STARLIFT is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio 's star - studded World War Two home - front morale booster " Hollywood Canteen . " This 1944 crowd - pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in LA hoping to get a date with Joan Leslie . But really it was just an excuse for Warners to trot out every star under contract , from Joan Crawford , John Garfield , and Barbara Stanwyck to Peter Lorre , Bette Davis , Sydney Greenstreet and more . STARLIFT features two Air Force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet Nell Wayne ( a mask - like Janice Rule ) and persuading a bunch of Warner Bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops . But in place of Crawford , Garfield et al the best the brothers Warner could scrape up in 1951 were Doris Day , Ruth Roman , Gordon MacRae , Virginia Mayo , Gene Nelson and Phil Harris with fleeting appearances by James Cagney , Randolph Scott , and a clearly embarrassed looking Gary Cooper . This threadbare cast , whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp , is perfectly matched by the crummy production values . Presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection . How bad is it ? You can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage ! To describe STARLIFT as a sloppy , lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy , lazy and third rate . It 's just terrible . Avoid it .
0 This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does n't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes . What she does do however , is shine when she 's on screen . The near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players of the day . JANCIE RULE shows promise and it 's a shame she did n't become a big star . RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the " go - getter " with aplomb . Better if this was in color . The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well . What 's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes . If you enjoyed THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN you 'll like this one .
0 Considering its pedigree , this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is . Even with a lip - smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together Lemmon , Lanchester , Kovacs and Gingold ? - the entire event is dully paced , drearily shot and , more often than not , witless.<br /><br />Kim Novak 's gifts were not essentially comic , as she went on to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid . James Stewart was a fine comedian , as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey . I think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does . Except maybe the cat .
0 Chesty gringo Telly Savalas ( as Frank Cooper ) is a US - Mexico " Border Cop " .

0 I would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand I was fully able to understand it for what it is .. A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.<br /><br />I do n't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well . The director firstly presents the material in an extremely " arrogant " way and worse , extremely incoherently . It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order , making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first , and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us , the viewer to CARE by the end of it.<br /><br />I respect surrealist cinema for what it is . ( creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life ) But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times , and a modern day earth setting , that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore , simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together . The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story ; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a book , but being frustrated by the fact that the camera does n't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.<br /><br />Let 's compare stylistic cinema . Compare Gaspar Noe 's " Seul contre tous " to this . He gave us a coherent , extremely engaging and intellectually deep story . This movie offers no intellectual study , and while it is very stylistic in it 's fragmented presentation , the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.<br /><br />Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things .... to a POINT . But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say " Who cares . " It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order . Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging . Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish , and in every way this film TRIES to make the viewer look foolish.<br /><br />If you have too much time on your hands , then please watch this film , taking into account what I have said of it . It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning .
0 Claire Denis 's movies seem to fall into one of two categories : the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate . " L'Intrus " definitely falls into the first category , but it 's not so awful as " Trouble Every Day " or " J'ai pas sommeil." < br /><br />Now , ever since I saw " Chocolat , " I 've made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes . And I have always been disappointed . " L'Intrus " was no exception . She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one . < br /><br />You get a lot of the Denis regulars : an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips , the gap between her teeth , her ample cleavage , and a couple of nice coats ; the black guy from " Trouble Every Day " and " J'ai pas sommeil , " Grégoire Colin , and that Lithuanian or Russian girl . Michel Subor 's character was interesting enough , but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when , somewhere in Korea , I think , he finally got it cut . < br /><br />There was certainly some action -- gruesome murders , a man 's search for a son -- and there may even have been a plot , but one viewing was n't enough to figure it out , and two viewings are , I fear , out of the question . For one thing , the score was jarring and obtrusive ( as in " Beau Travail " ) . For another , the seasons changed too abruptly , leaving you even more confused about what was going on . Oh , there were a few pretty shots , and if you liked " Friday Evening " with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets , you might appreciate the aesthetics of " L'Intrus . " Otherwise , steer clear . < br /><br />I saw this movie in French and it 's possible I missed something crucial . But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages , double spaced and with ample margins . In " Chocolat " the silence is sublime ; in " L'Intrus , " it 's just dull .
0 For the big thinkers among us , " The Intruder " is a maddeningly incoherent movie from France that gives so - called " art films " a bad name . The story is something about a bitter old coot , Louis Trebor ( Michel Subor ) , who goes searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant , but beyond that , I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing . With no coherent storyline to boast of , the movie loses us early on , though I 'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film . < br /><br />This muddled , snail - paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits .
0 I 'm a big fan of 50s sci - fi , but this is not one of my favorites . While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci - fi flick , the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie . It 's clear he was working with no money , because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever . I have * never * seen so much time - killing in a movie.<br /><br />There are probably less than 60 seconds of " blob footage " in the entire movie , and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly - written , run - on dialogue . It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together , but good heavens ... how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers ?
0 The Blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever , sung by an uncredited Burt Bacharach of all people ! You really have to hear it to believe it , The Blob may be worth watching just for this song alone & my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics ... After this unnerving opening credits sequence The Blob introduces us , the viewer that is , to Steve Andrews ( Steve McQueen as Steven McQueen ) & his girlfriend Jane Martin ( Aneta Corsaut ) who are parked on their own somewhere & witness what looks like a meteorite falling to Earth in nearby woods . An old man ( Olin Howland as Olin Howlin ) who lives in a cabin also sees it & goes to investigate , he finds a crater & a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick . Laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick , if you know what I mean ! It then slides up the stick & attachés itself to the old man 's hand . Meanwhile Steve & Jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of Steve 's car , Steve being a decent kinda guy decides to take the old man to Dr. T. Hallan ( Alden ' Stephen ' Chase as Steven Chase ) at the local surgery . Dr. Hallan says he does n't know what the substance on the old man 's hand is but it 's getting bigger & asks Steve to go back where he found him & see if he can find out what happened . Steve agrees but does n't come up with anything & upon returning to Dr. Hallan 's surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him . The town 's police , Lieutenant Dave ( Earl Rowe ) & the teenage hating Sergeant Jim Bert ( John Benson ) unsurprisingly do n't believe a word of it & end up suspecting Steve & his mates Al ( Anthony Franke ) , Tony ( Robert Fields ) & someone called ' Mooch ' Miller ( James Bonnet ) of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department . However as the blob continues to eat it 's way through the town Steve sets about finding proof of it 's existence & convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire world!<br /><br />Directed Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. & an uncredited Russell S. Doughton Jr. I was throughly disappointed by this , the original 1958 version of The Blob . The script by Kay Linaker as Kate Phillips & Theodore Simonson is an absolute bore & extremely dull not making the most of it 's strongest aspects . The Blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics & conflicts between the teenagers & police , in fact the majority of The Blob is spent on Steve trying to convince the police of the blob 's existence . For most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential & somewhat forgotten . It only has two or three scenes for the fist hour & a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults & teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob & have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards , yuck ! Why could n't the blob just eat the lot of 'em ? No explanation is given for what the blob is or it 's origins other than it came from space , how long did it take them to come up with that ? The dialogue is clunky & silly as well , as are people 's actions & decision making , I love the part when a nurse named Kate ( Lee Paton as Lee Payton , did anyone use their real name in this thing ? ) is confronted by the blob , she throws some acid over it & calmly proclaims " Doctor , nothing will stop it ! " , how does she know ' nothing ' will stop it exactly ? There 's no blood or violence so do n't worry about that , the special effects on the blob itself are n't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time & moves very slowly , a bit like the film in general actually . The acting is terrible , McQueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old & it shows , he looks old enough to be his own dad ! Same thing goes for most of the other ' teenage ' cast members & everyone generally speaking are wooden & unconvincing in their roles . Technically The Blob is very basic , dark static photography , dull direction & forgettable production values . The Blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper & is well known as being a ' classic ' but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen . This is one case when the remake The Blob ( 1988 ) is definitely better than the original . The original Blob is slow & boring & the remake is n't , the original Blob contains no blood or gore & the remake does , the original Blob has incredibly poor acting & casting decisions & the remake does n't & the original Blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film & the remake features the blob all the way through & it virtually eats an entire town . The choice is an easy one , the remake every time as it 's a better film in every respect . I 'll give the film two stars & give that wonderful main theme song one on it 's own . Definitely not the classic many seem to make out .
0 When a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight . The only part of this senseless drivel that I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars . This dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese . This thing actually made 20 million bucks ? And McQueen 's salary was 3 K ? All were vastly overpaid . The ' monster ' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the ' teens ' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen - age years . And those blasts from the shotgun ; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor . The ending was pitifully trite ; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel .... and there were many . Thumbs down .
0 This is the least scary film i have ever seen . How the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film . The blob moves so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape it . The blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten . If you have nt seen this film i recommend you do , its far too funny to be taken seriously .
0 Do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation ? Technically , I am a Boomer , though at the time when all the " idealistic youths " of the ' 60s were reading Marx , burning their draft cards , and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives ; I was still in grade school . But I remember them well , and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools , who would believe anything as long as it was destructive.<br /><br />This is just another excercise in self - importance from the kids who never really grew up .
0 Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television ( or the media in general ) as the 1960s ? No . And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time ? Not really . But if we must have one , does it have to be as shallow as " The ' 60s " ? < br /><br />I like to think that co - writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two - part miniseries than what ultimately resulted , especially given Couturie 's involvement in the superb HBO movie " Dear America : Letters Home From Vietnam " which utilized little original music and no original footage , letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves . This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production , but it does n't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time ; like so many of its ilk , it 's seen from the point of view of one family . But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the ' 60s ( it 's amazing that one of them does n't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont ) , making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.<br /><br />The makers rush through it so much that there 's little or no time to give the characters any character , with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children 's father is especially clichéd - and then when they 're back on BLAMMO ! it 's something else . Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly . In fairness , Jerry O'Connell , Jordana Brewster , Jeremy Sisto , Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try , but they 're wasted ( especially the latter two ) ; it 's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton , and Rosanna Arquette ( in an uncredited cameo in part 2 ) is always welcome.<br /><br />What is n't welcome is how " The ' 60s " drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect ( and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles , no Rolling Stones ... then again , there 's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album , right ? ) . Capping its surface - skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out - of - place happy ending , " American Dreams " and " The Wonder Years " did it all much , much better . Nothing to see here you ca n't see elsewhere , people ... except for Julia Stiles doing the twist , that is .
0 The 1960 's were a time of change and awakening for most people . Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke - out about their views . Racial tensions , politics , the Vietnam War , sexual promiscuity , and drug use were all part of the daily fabric , and the daily news . This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie , and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film , two families are followed : one white , one black . During the first half of the film , the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles . Unfortunately , the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family . Admittedly , there are more characters in this family , and the story lines are intermingled , but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole , the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie . The movie is a work of fiction , but clips of well - known historical figures are used to set the time - line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one - sided .
0 The 60s ( 1999 ) D : Mark Piznarski . Josh Hamilton , Julia Stiles , Jerry O'Connell , Jeremy Sisto , Jordana Brewster , Leonard Roberts , Bill Smitrovich , Annie Corley , Charles S. Dutton . NBC mini - series ( later released to video / DVD as full length feature film ) about the treacherous 1960s , as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family . The film 's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families . However , Dutton 's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull , incoherent , and downright awful 2nd half . RATING : 4 out of 10 . Not rated ( later rated PG-13 for video / DVD release ) .
0 I like a lot of the actors / actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .The main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .In 20 or 30 years Nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90 's . I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot 's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana , N.W.A , Public Enemy , Soundgarden etc .The movie like this will be just as cheesy as The 60 's and I gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you are n't thinking i am living in the 60 's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .Next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
0 The ' 60s is an occasionally entertaining film , most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film . It is extremely uneven , and includes many annoying elements . Take for instance the switch between black & white , and color . If done right , this could of been fairly effective , but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience ; much of the film had an odd feel to it . The acting was n't extremely bad for a made for TV flick , but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times . Many of the events were not coherent , and ending up being confusing . How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960 's ? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes ; because it was hollywoodized , everything had to turn out right in the end . I would advise you to not waste your time on The ' 60s and do something else with your time . I 'm glad I watched this in class , and not on my own time . I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan 's music . Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick . I hope you take my advice , and stay away from this .
0 Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the 1960s ( ok , so Katie did n't join the Manson Family , and nobody died at Altamont ) , this movie was still unbelievably awful . I got the impression that the " writers " just locked themselves in a room and watched " Forrest Gump , " " The Wonder Years , " and Oliver Stone 's 60s films over and over again and called it research . A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode " head spinning " . He was right .
0 Somehow they summed up the 60 's , ten years that radically changed our country , in four hours . And what a painful four hours it was . They trivilized the major events and happenings and they " claimed " it was about two families yet you barely saw the african - american family . If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash . What was amusing was this happy - go - lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways , but managed to attend every major 60 's event through the country . And the second family was such a non - factor . They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family . That poor son ... Please NBC , do not make any movies about any other eras .... leave that to PBS and the History Channel
0 The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy . Seen in that light , it does deliver . < br /><br />If you 're looking for a serious movie , look somewhere else . This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of " issues " with no insight whatsoever.<br /><br />Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable , stereotypical ways . < br /><br />Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable , and Michael Rappaport turns in a good performance , but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite , it 's hard to find anything redeeming .
0 This movie masquerades as a social commentary , when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns . The premise of this movie : African - American = Strong ... any other race = weak . The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy . The Jewish guy , in stereotypical fashion , crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life ... but the big , strong , defiant Omar Epps stands strong with no fear . We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist . The raped white girl , of course , begins considering lesbianism since she 's just a weak white girl after all . When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads , who are incredible cowards ; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men . Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE ? ? ? Yeah , right.<br /><br />Of course the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves in with them easily . The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out . This movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud . The overly long slow - motion between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- it 's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other ( and they 're all under 5 ) . Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest .
0 This is one of the most putrid movies of the 90 's . I would not recommend it if you have something better to do . < br /><br />This picture presents African - Americans as savage , uncultured , violent , inarticulate , reefer - smoking sociopaths . Fudge(Ice Cube ) and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm , not just the white people , but Asians too , and are never disciplined for their actions . Despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way . In fact it is Fudge 's influence that causes Remmy to bond with the skin heads , to drop out of college , and eventually to kill Malik 's girlfriend.<br /><br />The skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else . They never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police . They do commit serious crime such as battery and rape , yet they 're not as repulsive nor as threatening as Fudge and Dreads(Busta Rhymes ) are.<br /><br />There 's a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle . Some of it is as follows below.<br /><br />Fudge and Dreads are stated as students at the Columbus University yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition . One is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances . Though they are students at what looks like a private university , they can not utter a single line of proper English . Their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia.<br /><br />It appears that drunken Kristen(Kristy Swanson ) knew exactly why drunken Billy was taking her to his house . She even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin . The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy . Later Kristen was assured by Taryn(Jennifer Connely ) that she holds no accountability in that matter , and despite willfully jumping into a guy 's bed she was n't ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator . Then a week or so later she met , and slept with , an ultra - sensitive do - gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom . The director stressed contraception thoroughly.<br /><br />This movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail . Cole Hauser 's acting , and Laurence Fishburne 's accent are the only reasons I can think of to watch it . The writer / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence . Go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want , but keep in mind that neurons do n't grow back . Just follow the advice at the end and UNLEARN .
0 Yes , people are racist . People are even racist in college . That 's a good point , and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films . What sets Higher Learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham - fisted and predictable way possible , oh yeah it 's in college too.<br /><br />This film deals with this problem of racism the way Frankenstein deals with most problems , it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner . Most of the characters are cartoonish , one - dimensional , caricatures ( lesbian feminist , angry black man ) , that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible . Instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them . The angry black men feel cheated , feminists hate men , etc . ( one feminist even holds a sign that reads " Dead Men Do n't Rape . " See what I mean ? ) I do n't want to give anything away , but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they 'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to . The changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie . The big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo - Nazis will act like violent neo - Nazis . I 'll guess you 'll just have to watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this movie is that it 's supposed to be " gritty " and " hard - hitting , " but they make Nazis the bad guys . I agree Nazis are evil , but that 's my point . Everybody thinks Nazis are bad ; we 're not breaking any new ground here . Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930 's . The film does n't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements . It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy , after - school - special like , manner . Being anti - rape , anti - racist , and anti - Nazi is n't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.<br /><br />Higher Learning is predictable , cartoonish , and in a word stupid . Avoid at all costs .
0 Higher Learning says its OK for blacks to torment white people because they 're all oppressors . most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages . Stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race . Incompetent acting , direction , and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick . An appalling piece of trash . the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed .

0 I do n't understand why people would praise this garbage . Its wrong , stupid , unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else . The film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in College . This is where it fails . It has no grasps on reality . From many questionable non - sense scenes in the movie such as for example < br /><br />A black man chasing down a white man with a gun , the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them.<br /><br />The same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a Rodney King style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards.<br /><br />As one previous reviewer pointed out Several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs Bust A Rhymes < br /><br />Another critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters . From the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful ( ? ) black people . Its almost as its an insult to both black and white people . I am a white male and I know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.<br /><br />The storyline which I will explain now revolves around three characters . One a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film . They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah do n't forget education . Which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out . In which after they go back to their boring lives and think " being white is bad " . Does this sound alot like your college years ? Did n't think so . I do n't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess.<br /><br />Overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie . If you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of college rent Porkys . Just avoid this mess .
0 MINOR SPOILERS!<br /><br />Well i just sat up late and watched this film , mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of Singleton 's earlier work like " Boyz n the hood " . However , i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived , clichéd , so - called " message " movies . < br /><br />The acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors ... take note ) , the situations hard to swallow , ( rape victim becomes overnight lesbian? ... please ! ) , but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of . By the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation , making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one - dimensional players.<br /><br />Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural , sexual and political ignorance . As a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems . It 's message is contradictory , resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion . As for the films conclusion i found it predictable , embarrassing , exploitative and mildly offensive . For a film called " Higher Learning " i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again.<br /><br />If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire " American History X" .... unless you were just watching it for Tyra Banks then go hire a life .
0 Singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with . I get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart ; however , this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous . In addition , there are a bunch of " might - makes - right " messages like when our local Nazi jerks get beat up . I mean , who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks ? However , he way Singleton portrays the " fight " is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else . There is another " bad guy " ( in reality a drunken frat boy ) who rapes one of the movie 's protagonists . In this instance , I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one . In any event , he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas . I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape . Well , no means no , this is a rape , which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country.<br /><br />Having established the rape , how does Singleton deal with it ? When the frat boy tries to call the woman , her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone , at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a " black bitch . " The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube , et al , who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged " apologies " to roommate for his racist remarks ; however the ( apparently in Singleton 's mind ) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned . Again , no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy ; however , Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.<br /><br />What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton , while no doubt a talented director , does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude .
0 First of all yes I 'm white , so I try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race ... anyway ... White People Hating Black people = BAD but Black People Hating White people = OK ( because apparently we deserved it ! ! ) . where do i start ? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes : the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co. get in a fight with some really big , really strong , really really angry and scary looking Neo - Nazis and win ! ! ! the neo - Nazi where twice the size :) , and the chase ! the chase is priceless ... This is NOT a movie about race , tolerance and understanding , it does n't deliver ... this is a racist movie that re - affirm all the cliché stereotypes , the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead ... cmon simply awful I do regret ever seeing it.<br /><br />Save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written , poorly acted , dull and clearly biased picture , if you are into the subject , go and Rent American History X , now that s a movie
0 Despite , or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters , stereotypes are in , and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not - too - subtle cinematic screed.<br /><br />One gets the sense that John Singleton was dabbling in post - structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day , and " Higher Learning " was the tendentious result . The low point of the movie is the " peace " rally , in which the symbols of the 1960s " free love " movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a " Take Back The Night " rally with live , stridently identity - conscious musical acts in tow . Perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam ? Ooh , how Adrienne Rich of himand Remy 's firing into the crowd is a nice touch , if you 're into Rich 's sort of political posturing.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie negative stars . I can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history , a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race , class , and gender to popular culture and declared man - hating " a viable and honorable POLITICAL option " . Where 's Camille Paglia when you need her ?
0 I have n't read a single IMDb comment for this movie that mentions how the Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist skinhead while the movie 's lead black character looked in sternness down the barrel of a gun.<br /><br />I do n't know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life . I agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if Singleton did n't make his characters such broad caricatures.<br /><br />On the surface he tries to portray Ice Cube 's character as a bad guy , provoking Remy to become a racist skinhead . But who graduates at the end in the movie 's redeeming epilogue ? It seems Singleton points at white as either unable to empathize ( I did n't say sympathize ! ) with his fellow black student OR only able to take the path of a racist skinhead . Many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry.<br /><br />Nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism , which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle . Quite honestly what was the point ?
0 This movie shows how racist John Singleton is . He portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system . How quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it . Ice Cube 's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film . Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other . When Omar Epps says " I need to be with my people " , that racist remark spoke volume . And John , do n't think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention . Nice touch !
0 Based on the personal experiences of director John Singleton 's time at the University of Southern California , comes Higher Learning . A film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges.<br /><br />There are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story : Malik Williams , an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an African American male . Kristin Conner , a sheltered soft white girl , and Remy , a unsophisticated unconnected white male . All three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared ( Malik ) , by being naive ( Kristin ) , and by being unwanted ( Remy).<br /><br />One good thing about the film is that it does show that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large . The colleges are not places to build character , develop potential , or enhance personal advancement , but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one - size - fits - all atmosphere . It is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students . It would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics.<br /><br />But it did n't and that 's where the films falls apart . Singleton , it seems , had a pretty bad experience at Southern California . Through this film he lets it all hang out . There is no need to beat around the bush here . Singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen.<br /><br />The black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains , save for Kristin , who was raped by a fellow white student.<br /><br />Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film ? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her ? The ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence ? < br /><br />The performances of Omar Epps ( Malik ) and Kristy Swanson ( Kristin ) are disappointing . They do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie ( Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were unavailable ) . O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube , Busta Rhymes , and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles . And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor . Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character , of the three main characters , changed the most in the film.<br /><br />John Singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in American college life with this film . And he did so quite badly . It was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun . Life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this . Higher Learning is proof that he did not understand this at all . Seeing the film , then and now , would only confuse , disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to . Not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest .
0 I know John Singleton 's a smart guy 'coz he made Boyz N The Hood , so how did he write and direct this ? It 's like the pilot of a bad " going away to college for the first time " teen soap , a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition , I guess . Who would 've guessed the date - rape victim would dump sausage for seafood ? The angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of Neo - Nazis ( and would be roomed - up with a black AND a Jew - just for laughs ! ) Even Laurence Fishburne 's creepy reactionary history Professor just irritated me and I love the guy , it 's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot . Except Busta Rhymes , of course . Big ups .
0 When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb 's views on a film and , until this one , had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site I did not enjoy.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet , a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century , really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can : filling a film 's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />I like films with flawed characters , but no matter how dark someone 's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too , we 're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others . Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch - black characters.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke 's Hank is a 30-something whining , immature , irresponsible man - child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he 's a loser , which he very much is . His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he 's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed . By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film , it 's more pathetic than uplifting . Ethan Hawke plays his character well , but is n't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he does n't ' particularly care that it 's there.<br /><br />Speaking of which his character 's wife is equally as bad . Just about every single shot of the film she 's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non - existent self - esteem with insults . Seriously , that 's just about all the character does . Her harpy - like behavior borders on malevolent.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays their father Charles , and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades , he spends about 90 % of this film with the same mouth open half - grimace on his face like he 's suffering from the world 's worst bout of constipation . For someone who 's been an actor as long as Mr. Finney , you think he 'd be more apt at emoting . Even though he does n't show it much , his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger - filled . And when he smothers Andy at the film 's conclusion it 's akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it 's own misery.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is n't given much to do with her character . Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason . When Andy 's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship , but it really does n't make her any less selfish or self - serving than any other character in the film , but probably the one with the most common sense at least.<br /><br />And finally we come to Andy , played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman , is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 . His performance of the heroin - addicted , embezzling financial executive who 's " perfect crime " of robbing his parent 's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing . His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable , deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic . Hoffman 's character ends up being the film 's chief villain , but it 's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who 's self - admitted poor early parenting led to his son 's eventual psychosis and indirect , unintentional murder of his mother.<br /><br />Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH 's great performance and it 's family train wreck nature . Just do n't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for , because there really are n't .
0 warning : It contains spoilers . If a movie starts with a sex scene then it 's a bad movie . ( see for example 300 ) . This one confirms the above lemma . The second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action . The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring . Even more , other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times . And this made more frustrated . To compensate the consequent lack of suspense , we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters . And oh yes , they have lots to show . Andy ( P.Hoffman ) , for example , is a drug addict , more ? , he is cheating his wife , more ? , he plans to rob his father , more ? , his wife is cheating with his brother , more ? , he does n't regret his complicity to his mother 's death , more ? , he is a serial killer , more ? etc etc it 's not enough space to write here ... I wonder how could he have a top job . And why his wife did n't leave him before . On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman.<br /><br />Even here PSH saves what is left from my 7 $ spent for this absurdity . Why absurdity ? Because it does n't have sense , why should I care for the despicable characters ? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic ( at least pleasant ) character . < br /><br />Also it 's a lot of sentimentality , for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime .
0 < br /><br />Although the lead actress is STRIKINGLY beautiful , the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story.<br /><br />One may believe that middle - class teen - age school girls in the 1950 's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year - old 's they barely know , but I doubt it.<br /><br />One may believe that young high school teens are highly self - confident and self - assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations , but my experience has been , more often than not , teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world.<br /><br />One may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of Stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake , but I think not.<br /><br />One may believe that 30-something - year - old troublemakers can enter into , and hang around inside , a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble , but I think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents , chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this.<br /><br />One final nit , throughout Hey Babu Riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome . There is probably an explanation why the FIVE were the FOURsome , but because it was never detailed , each reference distracts from each scene.<br /><br />This movie did not ring true for me .
0 Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain . He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick ... Very embarrassing . Nacho had made some commercials in TV , I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid ( the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection ) . < br /><br />This little movie is like a Nacho 's commercial : bad storyline , bad directing , and awful performances . I ca n't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater . Poor Oscar ... <br /><br />Nacho could made this movie because of his wife , the producer of this 7:35 , a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business men .
0 Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors . He usually gives solid performances , such as in The Straight Story , and The Grey Fox . He also does fairly well here , but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget , poor writing , and so - so photography . The Miller - Movie formula gives it a 4 . Richard gets a 5 .
0 Hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting I 'd suggest it . If thou you happen to like cheap b - movies like me it 's good for a giggle ! Other than that I would n't suggest that you rent it , I 'd wait till it comes on the tube say round 4 am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite supplier . The band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick , and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews I could find on them . So once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how NOT to shoot a low budget movie .
0 Now , I 'm no film critic , but I truly hated " September 11 " . This film was , on a general basis , bad . With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu 's segment , which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter , the short films were at best boring , and at worst offensive . The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine 's pretentious segment in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers , even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause . The segment was completely off topic and , considering Chahine 's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever , a waste of my time and patience . The idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper , but in practice , it was tasteless .
0 In order to avoid confusion , let me clarify a couple of points : I am not a red neck . I am not even a moderate nor a conservative . Quite on the contrary , I am a radical : a Libertarian . I 'm not a WASP either , I was not even born in the States.<br /><br />Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry , and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry . This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry , by and for show - offs ; and I dare say , by and for people who have no sense of decency or , for that matter , respect for other people 's life or death ( especially when the victims are thought to be mostly ' bloody imperialists ' killed in Yankee soil . ) I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes , nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive . Just plain awful . Why did n't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack ? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism . Anybody who is serious about film - making ( and serious about life and death ) should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non - sequiturs . With two exceptions : the episode of Burkina Faso -- almost amusing -- , and the one from India --which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack , on the basis that afterwards he did n't return home and that he was an American Muslim ( and , truth be told , when the facts were known he was honored as a hero ) . All other nine episodes , essentially and extremely boring and emotionless , can be listed in two different categories:<br /><br />First : ' I do n't care about the thousands of victims : Americans , foreigners , children , youngsters , adults , old - timers ... ' and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion . Makhmalbaf 's ( Iran ) ; Lelouch 's ( France )  I 'm afraid I 'm going to commit an heresy since it 's Lelouch 's , but maybe , his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original ; Tanovic 's ( Bosnia - Herzegovina ) ; Gonzalez Inarritu 's ( Mexico ) ; Gitaï 's ( Israel ) ; Penn 's ( USA ) < br /><br />Second : ' The bloody Yankees deserve it ' . And can be resumed in frustration and hatred . Chahine ( Egypt ) vindicates the suicide bombers ; Loach ( UK ) considers the 9/11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship headed by the serial - killer Augusto Pinochet , in fact someone should inform Mr. Loach that the victims of Pinochet were not related to Al - Qaida and that Chile is a South American country which sole existence Mr. Bin Laden should have ignored , he ought to be informed too that the American government sanctions against the Chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie 's ; and , Imamura ( Japan ) windingly points out that WWII is related the attack to the WTC . Imamura has at least been coherent in this : the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical , which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake . It pretends to be obscure . It is , instead , quite ludicrous.<br /><br />There 's some kind of error shared by many , including some Americans , and it consists in the belief that this movie was n't commercially screened in the States because of some kind of censorship . Nothing further from the truth : This movie was n't screened in the States because it is a complete fiasco . A fiasco of the wackyest kind . Even in Buenos Aires , where Peronism and other forms of Fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants , and anti - Americanism is in vogue , the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters , and was applauded by a very select public : The usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally ' quaint ' spectacles . Like the sight of a McDonald 's fast - food restaurant or , perchance , an elderly Jew , being burnt to ashes .
0 In Theodore Rex poor Whoopi Goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case . The movie tries to be funny , and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works . The movie is far from funny , and the story is ridiculous . I voted 1/10
0 This is hands down the worst movie of all time . A combination of Whoopie Goldberg ( the worst actress / person in history ) and a talking dinosaur ala Jar - Jar - Binks add up to a painfully bad movie . That was an understatement . This movie is unwatchable . For the love of God , do not watch this movie .
0 I had n't heard of this film until I read an article about it on the Unknown Movies website , which made me curious . As a cartoonist and illustrator myself , I 'm an admirer of Richard Williams 's work - I rate Ziggy 's Gift as one of the finest Christmas specials of all time , and even though Who Framed Roger Rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when I got past the age of sixteen , I still have the highest of regard for the amount of work , care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals - but it seems the man has his faults , most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule , and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super - talented individual like Williams can go , given the right circumstances.<br /><br />Raggedy Ann and Andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children 's cartoon . It tries also to be a musical . It tries to be a thousand and one other things as well - is it a freakout ? Is it a mind - blower ? Is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination ? - until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations . It 's beautifully animated , for the most part , though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention , but even that does n't count for much when you 're confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the ' action ' here.<br /><br />There are a number of problems with the film , but let 's start with Raggedy Ann and Andy themselves . They 're the stars of the show , yet they have no personalities . Actually , we get the message that Andy is a wannabe tough guy ( " I 'm no girl 's toy " , he sings ) and that Ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner , a little girl called Marcella , carries her upside down , but that 's all we get to find out about these dull - as - mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after . I use the word " weirdness " advisedly , because some weird films can be hugely entertaining , but this is just flat - out strange . The toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable , but they 're actually bizarre and disturbing . The two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this . But even they 're relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain , whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous French doll . Yes , this is supposed to be a children 's film ! Then there 's the music , none of which is memorable , and all of which is sung by actors who ca n't sing . And to add insult to injury , there 's a lot of singing in this film . When Ann and Andy finally make it out of the playroom , the first thing they do is sing a LONG number in the woods about how scared they are , about how they 'll always have each other and ... yes , we get the message . This seems to go on forever , but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film . Not for long , though , because the Camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it 's made from worn and faded denim , and - bad enough that he 's clearly a paranoid schizophrenic - he also starts hallucinating . But this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow . The Greedy , a living , breathing . belching , farting , constantly eating pool of taffy , is so trippy , creepy and ultimately disturbing , you 'll hardly believe what you 're seeing - this is as close to a drug - free psychedelic experience as I 've ever seen on film . Then , after a l - o - n - g time spent with the Greedy , along comes the psychotic Sir Leonard Looney and his master King KooKoo , whose throne resembles a urinal . I ca n't believe I 'm actually writing a capsule description of a real film here - I just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that I 'm not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked - out nightmare I had . Part of the sequence in Looney Land resembles one of the old Winsor McCay / Little Nemo cartoons , for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it , probably . All this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it , but there is n't . These scenes are just strange , and very , very long . Surrealism only works when there 's a strong idea behind it , or takes place against some semblance of reality . But NOTHING in these scenes points towards any kind of reality . Take away this element , and you 're left with pure self indulgence.<br /><br />As the final scenes unravel , even the animation begins to look less impressive ( the pirate ship , ludicrously detailed , jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production ) and there 's a non - event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out . Even at a meagre 86 minutes in length , the film feels like a never - ending ordeal , and it 's understandable why it flopped on its original release . Animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how Williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly , but he did , and there 's nothing anyone can do about it .
0 I saw this movie when I was really little . It is , by far , one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . Now , normally , I like weird movies , but this was just a bit too much.<br /><br />There 's not much of a plot to the movie . If anything , it starts out like Toy Story , where toys come to life , and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend , Babette . From there , craziness ensues . There 's the Greedy , the Looneys , a sea monster named Gazooks , and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes , all of which just made the movie weirder . Also , I ca n't help but feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too whiny . She definitely did n't help the movie.<br /><br />Now , even though I did n't like this movie , there were a few cute parts . I liked the camel 's song . Even though it was a song about being lonely , it had a friendly feel to it . Then , there was Sir Leonard . While most of the Looneys were just plain nuts , Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest . King Koo Koo was just a little dirtbag that made Dr. Evil look like a serious villain . Also , there was Raggedy Andy 's song , No Girl 's Toy . It was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough . But , honestly , even these things did n't make the movie any better . ( But remember , this is just my perspective . ) < br /><br />While I personally would n't recommend this movie , even I have to admit , it does have its charming moments . See it if you 're interested , but only if you 're in the mood for something " really " out of the ordinary .
0 As others have said , " No , Luciano " is a more apt title or response to this movie title . For entertainment , the great opera singer should stick to singing ..... not that he 's a terrible actor . It 's just that this movie stinks.<br /><br />The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie , as it were - but after that it 's nothing but a boring soap opera.<br /><br />Appropriately playing a singer , Pavarotti , as " Giorgio Fini , " loses his voice a few times and the doctor , " Pamela Taylor " ( Kathryn Harrold ) comes to the rescue . The singer then falls for the doctor , the doctor slowly falls for the singer , the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes.<br /><br />Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy . It 's Harrold that spoils things and after watching her here I am not surprised she did n't become a star . < br /><br />There is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy , good shots of San Francisco and Italy , at least in the first half of the film . I got bored and do n't remember much about the second half of it .
0 By my " Kool - Aid drinkers " remark , I mean that these are such devoted fans of the man Pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film . Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr. Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre ! ! ! When this film debuted , I remember the savage reviews with headlines such as " No , Giorgio " and some said it was among the worst films ever made . This is definitely overstating it as well . While bad and far from a great work of art , there was a lot to like about the film and the movie 's biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth.<br /><br />Believe it or not , the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers ( who , I believe , were chimps ) . It is rare to see a movie with such clichéd dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight , but even they are n't the heart of the problem . The problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a " romance " that consists of a horny married middle - aged man and a seemingly desperate lady . Perhaps European audiences might be more forgiving of this , but in the United States in 1982 or today , such a romance seems sleazy and selfish -- especially when Pavarotti tells Harrold that he loves his wife and " this is just fun " . Wow , talk about romantic dialog ! ! Sadly , if they had just changed the script a little bit and made Pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic Hollywood films , such as from ALL THIS AND HEAVEN , TOO or THE SUSPECT ( where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her ) . Instead , she 's the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and left -- as Pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting Harrold.<br /><br />Sadly , even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti could n't save this film . Towards the end of the film , there are some amazing scenes in New York where the set is just incredible and Pavarotti 's singing transcendent . For that reason , I think the movie at least deserves a 3 . I really wanted to like the film more , but it was a truly bad film -- though not quite as rotten as you might have heard.<br /><br />Sadly , from what I have read , this film might be a case of art imitating life , as Pavarotti 's own life later had some parallels to this film , though this is n't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail .
0 An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who do n't appreciate opera , exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time , it fails badly . All that is desirable in this movie is the opera , and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best . The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome . < br /><br />Only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten . Like most opera stars , Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent , and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion . His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script . Perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one.<br /><br />Who knows , except those involved ? Do we need to know ? < br /><br />The plot is weak and trite . This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits ( the opera music ) hanging above the mud . We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti , and this one is n't one of them . Just get one of his many superb opera or vocal - concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.<br /><br />It would be one of IMDb 's 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes ; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers , actors , models , and athletes to exploit their popularity through film . Very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script . Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice . However effective he is as an actor ( opera requires it ) , not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.<br /><br />I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti 's singing and of opera because of this movie .
0 I too was intrigued by the high ( 8.5 ) rating for this film , and was very disappointed . I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row , but it was not to be . I went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way . There is not much of a plot , if any . I do n't necessarily need that in a movie , but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in . The best I could say would be that it aspires to be an Altman - esque film , albeit with an extremely small ensemble . Sure , there are moments , but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing . I do not understand the high rating for this film . I give it a 3.<br /><br / >
0 ( Rating : 21 by The Film Snob . ) ( See our blog What - To - See - Next for details on our rating system.)<br /><br />Here 's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on - screen tedium . < br /><br />You'll not be wringing your hands , nor rolling your eyes , nor sighing into your popcorn . No indeed . For a movie of * this * averagousity , only clawing at your own face will do . < br /><br />When you begin to claw your own face -- as begin you must ! -- start in at the lower portion . You 'll need your upper portion , with its handy tear ducts , intact for the Truly Tear - jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you have n't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then . < br /><br />In a season celebrating Joe Six - Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy , permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create . * Watching * it , however , is a much more dangerous undertaking . < br /><br />Here 's our story ... < br /><br />Sidney Young , the London publisher of a fourth - tier celebrity / entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under . He needs a miracle , and what he gets is a phone call from New York City , in the USA.<br /><br />The publisher of Sharp 's magazine , Clayton Harding ( played by Jeff Bridges ) says " Come work for me ! " With his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment / office in the background , saying " Yes " is a no - brainer.<br /><br />Soon Sidney is at work in New York City , doing allllllll the wrong things . His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are ( 1 ) Jewish , and ( 2 ) gay . < br /><br />He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes , the industry 's hottest movie star , when she leaves it in the magazine 's offices during a business luncheon.<br /><br />This is a spot of bad luck for everyone , for , among other things , Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes , before he wakes up to the Dunst character.<br /><br />Worst of all , he totally alienates Alison Olsen ( played by winsome scripting - confusion by Kristen Dunst ) , a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine * and * The Big Apple . ( We have , of course , been to a movie before , and so we know how this relationship is going to end up . This is therefore why we 'll need intact tear ducts for the movie 's third act.)<br /><br />The problem with The Thing is , the script just never jells , excepting for the one tear - duct set piece in which True Love prevails.<br /><br />Publisher Harding is supposed to be a son - of - a - bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over . The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy , however , and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze.<br /><br />Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young , but whenever he comes up to her ( as he does constantly ) she makes a point of engaging him in conversation , instead of attempting to discourage his existence.<br /><br />The " comedy " of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room , and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception.<br /><br />The hot starlet Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is " wounded . " The character never shows us * why * he is wounded , however . This is yet another resultant of the movie 's mortally wounded script.<br /><br />At one hours and fifty minutes , This Thing feels longer ( and more deadly ) than Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow . It is uninspiring , unfunny , unredeemable , and not even rentable . Run Away
0 Simon Pegg stars as Sidney Young , a stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit working as a celebrity journalist in this US comedy . After getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected Sharps magazine run by a reliably on form Jeff Bridges in New York . It 's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead . The unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for the laughs but they do n't exactly set the screen ablaze with their passion.<br /><br />Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine . Of course he 's eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet Sophie Maes ( Transformers ' Megan Fox ) . Fans of Shaun of the Dead , Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent Run Fat Boy Run as one of the UK 's best comic talents being ruined by the US.<br /><br />All in all this is a forgettable comedy . Please come back to us Simon , we can forgive and forget .
0 If you have read the book - do not set your hopes high , if you have not - go read it , and never watch the film . It is strange to learn that Toby Young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script ( as he claims himself in the post script of the book ) . Because the film is very different from the book.<br /><br />What the film seems to be aiming at - taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it - it achieves with perfection . The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms , and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had.<br /><br />You are better off not seeing it .
0 Not that he 'd care , but I 'm not one of Simon Pegg 's friends . If I was , there 's a good chance we 'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this . The trouble is , he found a successful formula as the bumbling , ordinary guy - next - door type in Shawn of the Dead , Run Fat Boy Run etc , but it 's starting to wear thin . Here his character has no discernible qualities , he 's rude and obnoxious , and thinks he 's funny when he frankly is n't . When transferred to New York from London ( and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic ) , he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues . Still , is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss . Yet somehow , Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him , even though he 's done nothing nice . Oh , and because he 's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight , possibly because her character is as shallow as his . It all makes for a predictable film conclusion , although I ca n't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life . The shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching . Pegg , though , plays himself , Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions , creating no on screen chemistry , and Megan Fox is n't stretched at all . The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes , as Pegg 's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer .....
0 The sitcom " The league of Gentlemen " follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village " Royston Vasey " . The different scenes are linked together by their common setting.<br /><br />In the first series , a sketch show , the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through Royston Vasey . Consequently , more foreigners visit the small town . But Edward and Tubbs , the owners of a " local " shop , which is actually far away from the town , do not like foreigners . Whenever a visitor enters their shop , they kill him . In my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all , for example , when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road . Edward drums , while Tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims . < br /><br />Moreover Pauline lives in Royston Vasey . She works at the local Job Centre . Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with , the woman does not want to loose her job . So when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman , she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet.<br /><br />Then there is Barbara Dixton , a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about " her " sexual conversion.<br /><br />Furthermore the vet , Mr. Chinnery , always kills animals instead of curing them . In one case , he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room , where a dog lays in his basket . The farmer goes outside . On the assumption that the dog is the sick animal , Mr. Chinnery euthanizes him . A second later , the farmer opens the door , holding the " real " sick animal , a sheep , in his hand.<br /><br />Some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew ( his friend is killed by the shop owners , by the way ) . The couple is very tidy . They have , for example , towels in different colours . Each colour stands for one part of the body . Besides , they have thousands of keys , marked with different colours and precisely classified.<br /><br />In my opinion , the actors play very well . By playing women , the scenes become comical . The costumes are suited to the actors , too . Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters , for example Edward , have unappetizing black teeth . The show has a great deal of dark humour , typical British . The set design reflects the mood of the series . The village and all the houses look grey and are decayed . Around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect . Even the village sign is ominous : " Welcome to Royston Vasey . You will never leave." < br /><br />Although I think that the actors do a great job , this type of series is not my taste .
0 I like British humor , I believe it 's one of the best in the world . I like almost every British sitcom ( okay ... maybe not Monthy Python , some of the jokes were great , but some of them I did n't understand . ) , but this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick . This show was good in some way ; it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel I 'm not hungry anymore . This is really just disgusting , sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff . I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off . It was so disgusting , watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... what 's so funny about that ? ? ? It makes me wanna puke . No humor , just disturbing images and cheap , toilet laughs ... I do n't know ... if you like this stuff ... you go ahead ... watch it ... but to be honest , people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems . Garbage .
0 Not funny - how can anyone link this to Monty Python ? That is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs . This is not funny . Over the top , but ugly , weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time . Unfortunately something that did not make them funny.<br /><br />It should be given some points for effort etc . whatever . Actually it appears there is a laugh track - or is there one ? Hummm .... Since there are barely any laughs that 's a debatable question.<br /><br />Maybe I 'm doing it injustice - maybe it 's some sort of exercise . Some sort of art - in that case anything goes , never mind.<br /><br />But these guys playing women with high - pitched voices , turned - up noses . Come on ! ! ! Not funny . < br /><br />There is only one heir apparent to Monty Pythons intellectual wit and that is Stephen Colbert , and maybe Jon Stewart .
0 I 'd really , really wanted to see this movie , and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account . When it showed up in our mailbox , I threw it straight into the DVD player.<br /><br />I was very sadly disappointed , which in turn made me mad . I 'll give any movie a chance , even if I want to walk out of the theater / press ' stop ' . I watched it all the way through , but did n't get anything from it but frustration.<br /><br />The acting was very , very good , but that was about it . Nothing is explained ; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind , we 're never given insight to his ' downfall ' . While we understand that he and Cedric break up , again , we do n't see it happen or WHY it happened . During an interview with Mathieu 's doctor , Cedric reveals that he 'd cheated on him once , but it was no big deal . I expected to see this in flashbacks , but no -- nothing . We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital -- but AGAIN , we do n't see it.<br /><br />I know some movies are a ' take it as it is ' basis , but this movie honestly ticked me off . When Pierre , Cedric 's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble , we do n't see hide nor hair of him until near the end , and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex . His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different . I might even be wrong saying this , it was that confusing.<br /><br />The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed , out - of - place and confusing pace . I can keep up with films like ' Pi ' , ' Citizen Kane ' and other films that have flashbacks / flash - forwards left and right , but CU did n't capture and hold onto the style . At the end of ' Citizen Kane ' , you know what 's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries . CU just leaves you hanging . It has an air of pretension in its ' we 're not gon na tell you a damned thing , figure it out for yourself ' presentation . It 's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing.<br /><br />Good acting , like I said . I liked the characters , but the whole story was just too disappointing .
0 Somewhere , out there , there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made . One 's that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space , or one 's where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti . This motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing . I think it 's some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it 's that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long , wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes . Do n't get me wrong , this is about the 30th gay film I"ve watched in the past 6 months and some of them ( most of them ) have been very formulmatic , predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time . The best one so far was " Beautiful Thing " . So , I watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered I thought " Oh , no , its going to be creative sinny mah " But I gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended I tossed the DVD in the trash . Sorry I did n't like it and if you did , sorry if I offend .
0 It seems there 's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema . Namely , happy endings are n't very common . Beautiful Thing excluded , gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death . And some , like Come Undone , just end ... period.<br /><br />The creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot , direction , and timelines . Within the first ten minutes of this film , I found myself a bit confused , and even more so after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim 's character having a little psych session . It seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency . There 's no real way to tell when you 're viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback . I could only take so much before it became truly unappealing.<br /><br />Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this film " ... shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real . " Well , it seems that Stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing , as this is truly far from beautiful . Due to all the praise this film received , I expected something worth watching . Sadly , the film lived down to its title . And by the end of the movie ( which provided no resolution whatsoever , I might add ) it 's plain to see that the writers , the director and the film have all Come Undone .
0 After reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth I decided to rent Come Undone . I must say I was rather disappointed . The story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed . The characters , despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting . The sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be . I 've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot . The ending is very anti - climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that was n't explained well to begin with . In my opinion , a waste of time .
0 There was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she 's always wanted after the worst life possible , beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with Eric Roberts . But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and this utterly destroys it in the end . It sounds weird , but I like the position Dean Cain was in at the end and the choice he made . He ca n't hurt her because he loves her and she 's the mother of his child ( I think the time frame makes it clear it 's his child and not his brother 's ) , but at the same he ca n't forgive her for all she 's done , sleeping with his brother ( which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way ) and then being part of his death . In better hands this would have been a better movie , but for something I caught on late night cable , it 's not bad .
0 The plot was quite interesting , with the Russian revolution background . I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partly filmed there . Sadly , there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them . The love scenes were forced and mechanical . Jordan kirckland was really stiff , almost icy . Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish , so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend . The ending , when we finally figure out who was actually after them , was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever . I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more credible .
0 Take young , pretty people , put them in an exotic locale , stick in a few bad guys , have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes , create the flimsiest of plots , then work out a happy ending for everybody ( other than the three or four who get murdered , of course ) That 's the classic ( and successful ) format of the Harlequin Romance . It 's not very good but then it 's not very bad either , like most of the little yellow pocket books . And the location stuff in Budapest is especially interesting , even if they did n't use the wonderful old train station ( designed by Gustave Eifel ) or show the city 's famous thermal baths .
0 The story concerns a genealogy researcher ( Mel Harris ) who is hired by her Estee Lauder - like cosmetic queen aunt . Her aunt ( by marriage we are left to presume ) is trying to track down her long lost family in Europe . All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box . The researcher heads to Europe and conducts her search in places like Milan , Budapest , and Vienna . The scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location ( unlike a Murder , She Wrote where Jessica is supposed to be visiting a far - flung locale and Lansbury never left Burbank ) . Anyway , she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys . The dialogue , particularly the romantic dialogue , is terrible . I watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that I stayed on just to see if it would get worse . It did . Acting was also off . I can see why Mel Harris 's career never really took off after thirtysomething , but she is adequate ( seems too old for her co - star though ) . But , the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse . I also lost count of how many times they say " Budapest " to each other . Yes , it is pronounced Bood - a - phesht . We know , okay ? I realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and sure enough it is . Guess that says it all .
0 Wow ! I 'm shocked to learn that it 's a small world and that we are all interconnected . What a waste of 88 minutes . John Dunne put it much better in one sentence . " No man is an island . " The acting was n't bad . The kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin I could n't follow it and the only real " hero " in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid . I do n't know . I just do n't get it . Oh well .
0 Geez , as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film - and I am glad of it ! ! ! Was this film broadcast on TV across the United States there would be a great anti - Gay backlash and I can not say that I would blame them . The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American , what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare . The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments ( anti - White ) are blatant and unsettling - society can not be blamed for people who have chosen drugs , unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film 's " cast " - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation , but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one 's self .
0 After watching this film , I was left with a two very annoyances about this film : why did they make Chen 's character this " McGuyver hit - man " and Lee 's character such an incompetent idiot ? Chen 's character 's background is that he was raised in an underground Cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild " dogs . " This detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive , he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt . Soon after this scene , he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant . Not only is he uneducated , he is starving . This is not a reference to Chen 's scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food , one of which , being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship . Si in the first ten minutes of the film , it is established that Chen is malnutrition - ed , unmodernized , and has only thing going for him , his " dog " brawling fighting style of some sort . Despite this situation , Chen manages to out - shoot every policeman ( even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head , whom was holding Chen 's girlfriend hostage ) and has somehow attained a super human strength ( swings a 50 lb block of concrete , plastered on the end of a metal pipe , to the head of the police chief AS he is getting shot in the chest , by said chief).<br /><br />Now Lee 's character ... okay , I get it , he 's depressed , he 's got some baggage , but wow , can he do anything right ? One moment , they try to make him cool , composed and ready to take care of business , and the next moment , he just got beat again . First scene he runs into Chen , and he manages to misses him , from approx 15 ft , multiple times . Toward the end of that scene , Lee watches Chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds , while holding a gun to Chen face , at a 10 ft distance . Even at the end of the movie , Lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again.<br /><br />And my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with Chen 's character and that he is just " killing to survive . " That would be a lot easier if I did n't just watch Chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie . Of the numerous people he killed , only two people had the intention of trying to kill him , the police chief and Lee . Others were just people who were eating , boat owners , taxi drivers , and policemen trying to arrest him , not kill . Overall , Chen 's character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants , even if its just a free ride . ( Did I mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film ? ) My 3 stars go to some of the interesting director / camera work who got in some nice shots.<br /><br />Bottomline : One made for the nut - hugging Chen fans . For me , " Dog Bite This DVD "
0 As it is often the case , the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories . Similar to Unleashed ( which was great , ) Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master 's bidding . The main characters , an emotionally undeveloped , amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer , are far from the common heroes and villains we often see . In fact , by the end , you lose track of who you 're supposed to empathize with , failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide.<br /><br />Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability , by the half - way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge . The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling . And in the end , you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary.<br /><br />On the plus side , the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies  so those who are n't familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood 's predictability should check it out.<br /><br />The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film . It was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten . Maybe I 'm the only one , but it strained my eyes.<br /><br />The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting build - up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget , low speed chase scene . And just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespearean tragedy , you realize that it 's not an ending at all , but rather a transition into a wacky country - music montage about peace and serenity.<br /><br />Throw in some grisly from - behind choke scenes , a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way , Asians ' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that did n't match the film , and you get the average bland Asian thriller.<br /><br />I just do n't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions  I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ? Ultimately , in the end , we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanus.<br /><br />4/10
0 This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life . The plot and message are horrible . There are too many mistakes in this movie that it 's impossible to keep up . I do n't even understand how this movie can get any nomination , let alone 2 . Here 's why : 1 ) Sam Lee portrays a angry / irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad . Pros : He 's angry alright . Cons : When it comes to the explanation scene , he can not convey the sadness / disappointment he has in his father . The crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes.<br /><br />2 ) To connect the movie to the title , there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene , which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer . I understand that it 's supposed to be a metaphor or what not ... but it 's just sooo dumb ! 3 ) WHY THE HECK DID THE COPS NOT SHOOT THE KILLER ? What the heck is wrong with this movie . When the killer started stabbing an officer , SHOOT him . He 's already dead ! What the heck ? There were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed , but I do not know why he was n't ! 4 ) During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt . In the scene , it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was hurt , so how the heck in the next scene that she 's lending all her weight on her left foot ? And this is the actress nominated as the best new performer ? WTF ? 5 ) The sounds in the movie are off sync.<br /><br />6 ) I am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia , so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight ? 7 ) This movie is just too violent without a purpose . Cops are beating CI to a pulp and then if they cooperate , they give them marijuana and coke ? This is overall the worst movie . I truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person . I have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life . WORST MOVIE EVER !
0 It 's a bad movie , it seems like there is only 5 police in HK , they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a Jacky Chan 's movie . All the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only . When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other , what a funny movie . In The movie , it 's like all the good guys died without a reason.<br /><br />They story line of the movie also sucks , the story jump here and there and bored people . But if you wanted to see a bloody movie , I think this is only a OK type of movie , I think U.S. made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
0 The title above is used to introduce the film " Gen " to its audience . Gen is about a young doctor(Doga Rutkay ) with an ill mother . The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job . While she drives , we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area . As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital , she sees the death body of a patient . This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days.<br /><br />Two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide . In fact , they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions . All their communication with outside world is cut off too . There is no way out ! ! In those few days , there will be more nasty murders . Now everybody suspects from each other.<br /><br />In my opinion , the idea is brilliant . It could have been very scary indeed . There are positive sides of the movie of course . I really like the beginning of the movie . Especially , when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital . Actings are okay . Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though . I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie . What I am saying is , it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end , we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening . The director needed to explain it altogether which I think did n't work well . Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital . Lastly , I would like to say a few things about the director . I am sure he will improve . This is his first attempt . I have recently found out that he is only 21 years old . That made me feel more positive about him and his future films . I am not going to rate this film * out of * * * * * though .
0 it is of course very nice to see improvements on Turkish movie industry , however , i would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar . starting from the script , which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think . especially the cheesiness of the dialogs , which were putting the audience in a position that , as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations , which , most of the times makes the movie unbearable . it also has an obvious ending ; you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning . the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people , like professionals right away!!!did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals , to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people can not use?????!!!!!!also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient , with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film . and that scene was so suitable for " Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir " title ! ! those are not the only weak parts of the movie . there were also a lot of preciosities in the film . the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from Hannibal , also appearance of Togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie ! the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor 's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it . Gen is a total disappointment . i would have wonder , if Sahan was not this famous , would Togan be able to shoot this movie , with this much of budget amount ? ? i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview . it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully ! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet!!!!hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry !
0 " Meatball Machine " has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous , awful and over - exaggerated sci - fi horror films that I have ever came across . It is about good against evil and a coming - of - age tale , with the aim of to entertain with bloody , sleazy and humorous context . Because of that the violence is n't particularly gruesome and it does n't make you squirm , but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely . The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen , if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi . This movie just have it all , it is bad to the bone ! , A must see for every b - movie freak ! ! ! ... Simply : an enjoying and rare gem .
0 This film is overblown , predictable , pretentious , and hollow to its core . The settings are faithful to the era but self - conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure . The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue . Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Hart 's War . Tom , you ca n't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank ! The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman . This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing .
0 The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks . As Mike Sullivan , he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional ( for him ) role . Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like , admire and root for . Sullivan was definitely not a good guy . It 's true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son . Even so , he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings . So Hanks took a role I would n't have expected him in , and he pulled it off well.<br /><br />Hanks ' good performance aside , though , I certainly could n't call this an enjoyable movie . After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic ( it was n't entirely clear to me for a while where this was going ) it turns into a very sombre movie , about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney ( Paul Newman ) , who 's a sort of mob boss , and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them " clean " so to speak ; isolated from his business . After the older son witnesses a murder , the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet , gets the wrong son ( and the mother ) , and leaves Sullivan and his older son ( Mike , Jr. ) on the run . It becomes a weird sort of father / son bonding movie.<br /><br />Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note ( at least in the overall context of the story ) it 's really very dark throughout , that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall . I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks ' performance , the movie as a whole just did n't pull me in . 4/10
0 Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist it just does n't work . I had a really hard time accepting this . Not that I do n't think Tom ca n't act he can I 've been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me . Maybe because I 'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole fails for me . The additions Jude Law , and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed . I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones . There are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really did enjoy the score , But Tom as " the angel of death " Sullivan was completely flat .
0 Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it might be brilliant literature , this cinema - adaption really sucks as it 's more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices . The story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty , and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight . I am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece , just perhaps that you can see Salma Hayek in here , but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that ? No gracias .....
0 Frequently voted China 's greatest film ever by Chinese critics , as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from the outside , and , frankly , I do n't get it at all . What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable , blandly directed and acted , with a complete shrew for a protagonist . Wei Wei ( do n't laugh ) is that shrew , a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband ( Yu Shi ) for the past several years . It is post WWII , and they live with the husband 's teenage sister ( Hongmei Zhang ) in a dilapidated home with not much money ( the man had been wealthy when they married ) . Along comes the husband 's old best friend ( Wei Li ) , who also used to be the wife 's boyfriend when they were teens . She considers running away from her husband with this man , while the husband pretty much remains oblivious , thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend . That 's the set - up , and it does n't go anywhere you would n't expect it to . I 've actually seen the remake , directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian . It runs a half hour longer , and is actually kind of dull , too , but at least it was pretty . This supposed classic is pretty intolerable .
0 -might contain spoilers ... but believe me , this movie spoils itself from start to finish.<br /><br />I walked into this movie with high expectations . It was my own fault . I had put too much stock in Steve Carell 's record to date . 40 year old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The Office . And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie . It 's always been a very good predictor in the past , but something is definitely off lately . The last time I felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching " Blue Steel " in 1990.<br /><br />This flick fumbled from start to finish . The script was flunky material . Awful writing all around . " Murderer of love " ? " Love is an ability " ? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck American Beauty 's writer(s ) ... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard . The entire flick was peppered with Three 's Company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene . Or the pointless / confusing aerobics scene . Or the awful laundry room scene . Right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen , they toss in one of these terrible moments . And it happens over and over and over again.<br /><br />And what 's with Carell 's character ? The guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love ? Let 's face it . Their conversation sucked . They both should have said their goodbye 's after a few minutes . Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie .... Carell 's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un - funny ( I think the exact line was " this one time when I was a kid " ... that 's it . seriously ) , but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses . The actors themselves looked like they were in pain , wondering why they 're being directed to do what they 're doing.<br /><br />Back to the IMDb thing ... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie 's promotional team off this site . I know it 's impossible , but it 's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings / reviews were either posted by 12 year olds , or by flunky 's hired by the studio . Check out The Family Stone 's rating ... if that 's a mid 5 , then this absolutely has got to be a 2 ... and that 's pushing it .
0 Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie , after all I thought Steve Carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like Anchorman , The 40 Year - Old Virgin , and Little Miss Sunshine . Boy , was I wrong.<br /><br />I'll start with what is right with this movie : at certain points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell . There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh , and it 's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle - room to do his thing . He 's an undoubtedly talented individual , and it 's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be , in my opinion , a total train - wreck.<br /><br />With that out of the way , I 'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.<br /><br />The film begins with Dan Burns , a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column . He prepares his girls for a family reunion , where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.<br /><br />The family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie . No family behaves like this . It 's almost as if they 've been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver . They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we 're 7 . It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating . Touch football , crossword puzzle competitions , family bowling , and talent shows ARE NOT HOW ACTUAL PEOPLE BEHAVE . It 's almost sickening.<br /><br />Another big flaw is the woman Carell is supposed to be falling for . Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated . What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded.<br /><br />It makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet . I left the theater wondering what I just saw . After thinking further , I do n't think it was much .
0 If , in the first 10 minutes of this film , you do n't realize that the main character , who writes a life advice column , is going to have the tables - oh - so - cleverly - turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself , then there is probably something wrong with you . The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie , even if the rest of the movie was good ( which it is n't ) < br /><br />There 's almost no chemistry between the leads , and Steve Carell 's stalker - ish behavior is embarrassing , not funny . It 's hard to believe Binoche 's character would have any interest in him . Then in the end it 's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after . Is n't that great America !
0 Oh dear . This movie could have been sub - titled " When writers go on strike ! " What a stinker . I had really high hopes for this , mostly after reading IMDb reviews , which makes me wonder about the whole IMDb rating system , but that 's a separate matter . I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman , Bruce Almighty , The Office , etc so I was expecting great things . To say I was disappointed is the understatement of the year . There are so many things wrong with this movie , but I 'll confine myself to ( a ) the implausibility of ANY family behaving like these people do ( A mass aerobics workout ? What planet is THAT real life on ? ) , the clunky script ( a murderer of love ? Please ) , and the fact that the character of Dan is so unlikable , you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him ? This movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue , creaking direction , ridiculous set - scenes and it was slow , slow , slow . We would have walked out after half an hour if we 'd not been with my parents , who do n't get out much and do n't like to waste money . Unlike the makers of this movie , who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire - that would have been more entertaining . If you like movies , avoid this like the plague .
0 Spoiler : Bunch of passive - aggressive people having family reunion . The script has them saying and doing things people would never do , at least anyone with a shred of decency . The hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion , unaware she will show up as his brother 's girlfriend at the reunion . He tries to defer to his brother 's claim , but she , knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her , teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper , rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch . At one point , she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him . He tries to cover his eyes . His heart is breaking . She thinks it 's funny , until she suddenly decides she does n't want the brother and leaves the reunion.<br /><br />The movie really drags . The audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul . The writing is unintelligent and unbelievable . We almost walked out , but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up , but nooooo . All the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills , out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this . Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine ? ? ? Jeez . Shame on them , the writers , the actors , the producers , and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen !
0 The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.<br /><br />I have no words , no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life . Steve 's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.<br /><br />The dialog was so contrived , the family was this cookie cutter Walton 's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and do n't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film .
0 I have a 5 minute rule ( sometimes I 'll leave leway for 10 ) . If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it 's probably not going to ever get better . I have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory . Dan in Real Life is definitely no exception . I was watching this turkey and thought ; wow , this is not funny , not touching , not sad , and I do n't like any of the characters at all.<br /><br />The story of an advice columnist / widower raising three young daughters , who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend . I suppose the tagline would be " advice columnist who could USE advice " ? I do n't know . Dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice . I guess THAT 'S the irony ? I do n't know . He goes to see his parents , brothers , sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat , which seems very sweet , and potential fodder for good comedy , story lines ... none which ever emerge . The central story is basically how he loves this woman , but ca n't have her . Anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he WILL get her , but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny , trite , lifetime movie network dialogue " murderer of love " to get to the inevitable happy ending.<br /><br />This is truly one of the worst movies I 've ever seen .
0 seriously what the hell was this movie about,,simply stupid,,i'd give it 0 but,,,1"awful " is the lowest you can go,,seriously this movie is not worth watching,,waste of time , i do n't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10,,i seriously can make a better movie than this , hire some other unemployed people,,'n i promise i 'll make a movie better than this,,this movie was so bad,,that i 'll never watch a movie starring Steve Carrel again , bottom line do n't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it,,i'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is Something Got ta give but after that this is the second
0 Wowwwwww , about an hour ago I finally finished watching this terrible movie ! ! ! I wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but I figured I 'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better . Or at least have some redeeming qualities , like I figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie , or like really intelligent , or very well filmed or something ... Needless to say , that was not the case and I wasted about an hour and a half of my life . I m not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this " may contain spoilers" ... IMDb , you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that . I thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and I was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings ... all the ratings with about 7 - 10 stars clearly must be about some COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movie ... I m still a big IMDb fan , but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3 .
0 There 's little to get excited about " Dan in Real Life " . First off , the whole setup is incredibly contrived . Did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant , Marie would n't have told Dan where she was going ? And since Dan did all the talking during that conversation , why would she be so attracted to him ? For that matter , I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie . He 's very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he 's truly a good guy ( for example he lies to Marie in the bookstore , ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a ' blind date ' ) . There 's more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught making out by the whole family . Yeah like that could really happen . Dan in Real life is slow - paced , sappy and manipulative . Even chick flicks like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable " tearjerker " .
0 I could n't bear to sit through he entire movie . Do families like this really exist somewhere ? There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such , and I think that that is a great description of how they behaved.<br /><br />More absurdly unbelievable writing / acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as " pigface " who , of course , has grown into a drop - dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard - educated plastic surgeon ( but only to do good in the world - not for the money , ) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date . That 's when I quit watching ... <br /><br />If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours , then perhaps you 'll enjoy this sentimental , self - indulgent waste of time .
0 The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box . A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does n't degrade . But the movie fails to get on with it . Instead it pads for 45 minutes , noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery . Since audiences do n't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out , it 's a strange choice : the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic . Once the fabric is discovered , the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs , and blue - collar co - workers want the invention squelched , leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements ; inventing the chemical , and running from oppressors.<br /><br />I ca n't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy . The tone is n't funny or comical . It 's more like serious social criticism of the day : that capitalism warps both supply chains and production . Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world . Yes , that 's probably true , but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact , the movie is simply an earnest argument . You 'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here.<br /><br />This is more like a British Meet John Doe ( Meet Nigel Doe ? ) .
0 I admit the problem I have with the much - celebrated Ealing films I 've seen so far could be mine . To my taste , either they are black and rippingly funny , or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories . That 's a self - important way of saying I wanted to like " The Man In The White Suit " but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time.<br /><br />Textile worker Sidney Stratton ( Alec Guinness ) may be meek in manner , but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that ca n't be broken or made dirty . Using a factory lab for his latest experiment , he toils against limitations both material and human - the latter being the benighted mill bosses who do n't understand what he is up to , then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him.<br /><br />"It 's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress , " Sidney complains , practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the Man.<br /><br />One problem with " Man In The White Suit " is that Sidney 's vision of progress is awfully small - minded , too , more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work . My problem is more elemental : For a comedy , " White Suit " is not funny . It 's a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit - takes , double - takes , triple - takes , and dizzy takes.<br /><br />The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney toils at , going " Bleep - Blop - Bleep - Bop " endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until Sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying . Like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film , it 's leaned on too long.<br /><br />I've never seen Guinness less affecting in a movie , even though he looks impossibly young and earnest ( though actually in his mid-30s ) . He seems so bloodless , even more so than the wax - faced general he played in " Doctor Zhivago " He 's the same cold fish whether he 's ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job ( pan - faced Vida Hope as Bertha ) or the more sultry charms of young Daphne Birnley ( Joan Greenwood ) , his one real ally in his fight against " shabbiness and dirt " , as she puts it , making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only Greenwood could.<br /><br />Supporting players make " White Suit " work as well as it does . Ernest Thesinger of " Bride Of Frankenstein " fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle . Howard Marion - Crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in " Lawrence Of Arabia " . Then there 's the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else.<br /><br />But most of the scenes are played so straight that one would n't think director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before ( his previous Ealing comedy " Whisky Galore " does n't reverse that impression , alas ) . Roger MacDougall 's play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster , but fails to present dull Sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights.<br /><br />Ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy . Yet the Ealings I 've seen never seem to do this , working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies . " Kind Hearts And Coronets " and " The Ladykillers " ( Mackendrick again , go figure ) are classics this way . " White Suit " , on the other hand , is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere , just like that unfortunate suit .
0 What was this supposed to be ? A remake of Fisher King ? Why do we care about Sandler 's character ? What a slow , dreary , boring , who - gives - a - damn - about - these - people movie ! ! ! Just simply painful to sit through , I turned it off before it was over . It 's so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler ; like I said : can you say " Fisher King " ? And how does this psychotic character function in his daily life ? We are n't supposed to think that deeply , I guess . Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to turn violent on him ? If they were such good friends , how did they grow apart ? If Cheadle is so in control , why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street ? We are never told . That 's why Fisher King was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks . Nearly 8 out of 10 average score ? I do n't agree . At all . Even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating , and this crap does n't deserve to be in the same universe with them .
0 Ursula Andress ' naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God . The other two women ( especially the one who plays the maid ) have great bodies as well . Then why is the higher grade that I can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10 ? Because , to get to Ursula 's unbelievable body , we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring ( keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version , not the 78-minute American one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material ) . In typical Italian - comedy tradition , most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures ( the army freak , the " latin lover " , the constant drunk , the naive maid ) that are not funny , simply overacted . Final word : watch this , but keep your finger on the fast - forward button , you 're gon na need it . ( * )
0 I 'm starting to write this review during a break as I watch the movie . It 's the first time I 've tried doing that , but I 'm having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks . That 's not because it 's intense but because it 's bad.<br /><br />It 's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable , especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother Ryan ( Colm Feore ) is on screen being tragic and bitchy , self - indulgent and self - pitying . This would have been a much better movie if they 'd just left that character out of the story.<br /><br />He adds nothing but mawkish , maudlin , very irritating melodrama . Maybe somebody decided that if they could n't make Ryan believable they 'd just make him obnoxious . The problem with that is : Who cares if a spoiled , whining , obnoxious jerk is dying ? Not me.<br /><br />The ONLY thing this character has going for him is the fact that he 's dying , and sorry , but that 's just not enough . Dying does n't make anybody special . We 're ALL dying , sooner or later . It does n't give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk.<br /><br />The other two characters , and the actors playing them ( David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah ) , are very much more interesting , and their story , without Ryan 's self - pitying interruptions , would have made a much better movie . But it 's not over yet , and it 's time to hit PLAY again . Maybe something great happens before the end .... <br /><br />Nope . Sorry . This rented turkey goes back tonight !
0 The past creeps up on a rehab - addict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox . " Life 's dramas " , presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable ( not even the writing has any bite or wit ) . The cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another , and the music and photography are lugubrious ( a couple of the visual effects are laughable , indie - cliché touches that reek of a puny budget ) . Although written and directed by a man , this was produced by a woman , and I 'm not sure but I think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men , estranged brothers growing closer , never quite gels , never feels natural or seems lived in . It 's an attempt to get inside a male relationship , but the careful , sterile presentation is a cheat . No one 's heart is in this , living , breathing , or bleeding this material . " The Perfect Son " is quickly diffused by too many cooks in the kitchen .
0 The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price . I expected a " Based on the true story " movie only to find a shot on home video hodge - podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non - related slaughter house scenes . The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects . I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but , low and behold it only got worse . If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten . Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one .
0 To compare this squalor with an old , low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old , low budget porno flick . The animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions . The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says in part , "  gripping retelling of the BTK Killer 's reign of terror . " This is NOT a retelling . A retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why . None of these things are true . I 'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly , this IS NOT one of them . This is n't even about the BTK killer . Save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead . THAT serial killer movie is accurate and true . However , if you just HAVE to see this movie for yourself , check it out for free at your local library and even then , you 'll still feel cheated .
0 I just watched this movie today and not only is it , terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man . I also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it 's clear crisp just filmed view.<br /><br />Thank heavens I work in a video store and I did n't have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity .. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! You 'd have a better time watching Dude Where 's My Car than this piece of crap ! And that 's not saying a lot for that movie either.<br /><br />The acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable . I was watching this movie and I wanted to kill myself during and after the movie.<br /><br />I walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie , I then took a shower and burnt my clothes . < br /><br />If I had half a mind I would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it ... well maybe members of Al Queda .. especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole .... just make a set up like a clock work Orange , And then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again .
0 Horrible , Horrible , Horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie . Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie . Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there . This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR . : ~ ( . Is it possible to write ten lines ? The acting was horrific . It had absolutely no flow . I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better(in comparison to this one ) . I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile . It appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights .
0 I ca n't really say what I think about this movie , its against the guidelines , I 've watched many many films , and this has got to be the worst one yet , Extremely low budget , I 'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes , cause I could of did a better job with a b&w 8 mm camera and a crew of monkeys . It was so bad I registered just to leave a comment , cause I had to tell someone , movie rental place was n't enough . But this is my 2 cents worth , I suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself . Cause i sure would n't waste the money on it myself again . Now i leave you with this comment . I hope your not made at the rental place when they wo nt refund you your money .. =)
0 As I work at a video store , I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I 've ever seen , and warn my friends and co - workers of it . Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie , my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer , even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever , then he 'd watch it . I lost . I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school , and those were hardly great feats of a young genius . This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value ( it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder , although it is surprisingly clear ) , but also in acting ( wooden , hollow , and pathetic do n't scratch the surface ) , as well as just generally bad movie feeling . I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash , suddenly , I was reminded of some bad high school plays ( I know that I reference high school too often here , but this film did seem very juvenile ) both in terms of the set , which seemed far too fake , but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script , not entirely sure what was actually going on . My review does n't do this film justice , because I ca n't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was . It 's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie .
0 This movie is just so awful . So bad that I ca n't bear to expend anything other than just a few words . Avoid this movie at all costs , it is terrible.<br /><br />None of the details of the crimes are re - enacted correctly . Lots of slaughterhouse footage . Weird cuts and edits . No continuity to the plot . The acting is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen.<br /><br />This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it 's content . The camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky . It looks as if it was shot on video.<br /><br />In fact , now that they 've got Dennis Rader with life in prison , I wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well.<br /><br />Seriously , do n't even think about watching this one . I 'd give it a negative star if I could .
0 This movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what , Being from and growing up in Wichita Kansas;I know for a fact 90 % of the movie was Bogus . Aside from the names of some of the victims , nothing else much was correct . The movie looks like it was made with dad 's handy - cam , It had footage that I believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house . I usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it , but due to the bad acting , poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending . It was a struggle to watch it through to the ending . I recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry . Crunch
0 This movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the DVD from the movie store . This movie made me sick not because it was gory , but because i wasted 2 50 on it ! ! ! ! It looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it ! I am so ticked off , even The BTK Killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG I ca nt even get all the words out to explain it DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 I have never watched a movie in so little time . The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit . It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film . There was obviously no money for lighting , filming , sets , location , scriptwriters , editors , actors ... Oh , there was absolutely no story either ! I need to write ten lines of comment ... Bad , awful , horrible , wretched , anguishing , tortuous , bilious , nauseous , sickening , fromage , disgusting , flimsy , icky , yucky , pukey , stinky , smelly , vile , putrid , all - thumbs - down , and I do n't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap - o - matic production was !
0 This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I 've seen a lot of bad movies . First of I 'm from Kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all . Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest . On top of that it looks like someone was like I 've only got $ 20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah do n't worry about researching btk at all just make up something . seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie . The slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter BTK did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie . The made for TV ones are way better and way more accurate
0 Do n't see this movie . Bad acting and stupid gore effects . A complete waste of time . I was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks , instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you , the watcher . Disgusting . The murders are pretty lame , basically strangulation . One woman he stuffs worms in her mouth , one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her . BTK = BTK broiler , burger king 's " killer " new sandwich .... ha ha . I do n't think this movie relied too much on actual facts . I mean , he real BTK killer did n't carry around a bunch of rodents , scorpions and worms .. and oh yeah ... a slaughtered cow head too . Go figure .
0 My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years , not to mention shared an office with him . When it was announced he was BTK , she was shocked . The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer . I 've heard her re - tell them many times . I 've inquired her about a lot of things , and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to . I 've read the entire book written about Raider , Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas.<br /><br />There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago , and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis ' killings , maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives.<br /><br />I'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie . This is based on my mom 's portrayal of him , all my readings on him , and the video tapes I 've seen of him talking.<br /><br />First of all , the camera angles were horrible . It looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera . The acting was terrible and I could n't even bear to watch it.<br /><br />Dennis Raider never had long hair . Dennis Raider was a " very anal man " and was a " follow the rule book " kind of guy . He was n't as nice as the movie made him look , he was very polite and abrupt , business like . Same goes for his killings , as far as we all know . If you 've seen his confession in court , you can already guess.<br /><br />And as for the obsession with the slaughter house ? No . Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs . In fact , he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods . Yet through - out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim 's faces and acting like he cared about the well - being of them.<br /><br />Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew , he confessed this , but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also.<br /><br />I really do n't even want to go in to this movie , and I 'm already ranting . This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK . This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie . If you want a badly shot half - porno with some slaughter scenes served the side , then this is your kind of movie .
0 I question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the BTK killer 's motives . Are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters ? Who is responsible for this ? Do n't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough ? What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims ! It was like a personality experiment : What disturbs you more , the slaughterhouse or the human murders ? They used actual names of some of the victims .... this movie was hideous , disrespectful and insulting ! The creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda ! People need to awaken and redraw the line !
0 This is the biggest piece of crap ever . It looks like they spent more time , effort , and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie . I really thought the DVD had been switched out with someone 's homemade porno until I recognized one of the actors from the cover . This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats . The picture is really clear , but that , along with the very unfortunate lighting , cinematography , if you can call it that , production , acting , if that is actually what they are doing , and script , if they had one , makes this movie look worse than an old porno . At least the old porno has a point . This just looks like some PETA members got together and decided to make a really disturbing , pointless PSA about animals rights and feelings . This is so not worth the money or the time . It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims . The people who made this movie should be glad he 's not still free , or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad .
0 This movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured . There 's male full frontal nudity , dead animal parts , dogs licking nipples , the female loosing control of her bladder . All shot in a gray cold color . Effective , but a little too much . We then move on to seeing the BTK killer 's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes . The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it 's creepy . Here we do n't see fancy or good imagery , it looks as if shot with your home camera . It does n't look horrifying , but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling . What this movie does n't have is any drama , really . There are some cop scenes every once in a while , but there 's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer . There is n't much of an arc to this story . This could have been an effective psychological thriller , a study of madness . Unfortunately , the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage . It 's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again . Sometimes you do n't know it 's coming and do n't have enough time to look away . And that I have to reject . I 'm all for low budget horror movies but I do n't tolerate animal suffering . It was unnecessary , excessive , and comes without warning . I 'm glad that Lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does , but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore . Stay away from this garbage .
0 This movie features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty . She has stunning green eyes , and is in the first few scenes and the last scene . She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive . She may not have a future as an actress , because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers.<br /><br />The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it . It is not a good horror film , or a good fake journalistic report , or remotely well done . There is no skill apparent in it 's production . It is like a bad student film . The story 's horrific elements do not make you sick , it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick . I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could .
0 This is by far the worst horror / thriller I 've seen in my 29 years . If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO . This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it . The plot is n't even the worst part of this movie ..... its the acting , camera work , lighting , and sound . there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie . whoever paid to have this film made is broke now . I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie . In its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killer 's capture but I 've seen movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this .
0 I rented this horrible movie . The worst think I have ever seen . I believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job . The worse film I have ever seen and I have seen some bad ones . Nothing scary except I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much . The acting is horrible , the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash . The slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a B movied look like an Oscar candidate . All I can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick . I would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
0 Oh My God ! Please , for the love of all that is holy , Do Not Watch This Movie ! It it 82 minutes of my life I will never get back . Sure , I could have stopped watching half way through . But I thought it might get better . It Did n't . Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual . No wonder us Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies . Everything about this movie is horrible , from the acting to the editing . I do n't even normally write reviews on here , but in this case I 'll make an exception . I only wish someone had of warned me before I hired this catastrophe
0 Story goes like this , Netflix was late sending me my dvds so I went on down to the the analog rental place known as " Blockbuster Video " They suck you know . Real bad , They have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet I never want to see any of those . So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf , all by its lonesome self . I like seeing films based on serial killers . Its just a part of humanity that I will never understand , therefore I wanna see that kind of stuff . Anyways I put this DVD in and all the sudden from the very first second , it sucks . I 'm sitting there with my b.f . and we are like , " what is this kind of crap ? " Unsteady camera operation , horrible acting,- the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead , Then a rat gets stuffed down her throat . I really wonder if the director has a hard - on for this crap . There is nothing decent about this " film " . All I have to say to the director is " do you own a freakin ' tripod ? " Every shot was brutally unstable . The music was awful . It was like they just decided one day to make a movie . They were probably gathering people from WalMart to show up and " act " for them . Just plain awful . If you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby - NOT what you should be doing for a living- SHould not make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself . Better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with .... Then you break out your BTK KIller film and say , " Wanna see this crappy movie I did once ? "
0 This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer . The events in this movie are not even close to the truth . Why they could n't make a movie of the real events does n't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce . Do n't even waste your time watching this for free . Low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of , which is really what this movie did . If they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie I would . The acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80s . Save your time and money by not watching this movie .
0 I was lying on my bed , with a really bad cold or flu or whatever . I figure maybe I 'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago . I wish I never picked this movie ! After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw up . Afterwords(when I got better of course ) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one . I hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do do n't eat or you 'll feel the way I felt after I first watched it . I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3 . At least that movie had better reviews on this site .
0 No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer . Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film . From start to finish , there was not one single highlight . The entire thing was horrendously put together ; the script , acting , plot , lighting , direction , ACTING , factual information , ACTING , just to name a few . A number of scenes are literally laugh - out - loud - funny , for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together . This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low - budget film , but this is not the case . Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil . How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know . I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK , because it is truly a stand - out in regards to how pathetic , and disturbingly awful it is . I can honestly say , in all my years of film - going , this is the WORST . MOVIE . EVER . I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage , and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand , had I known what I was in for . ZERO out of TEN .
0 Generally I do n't do minus 's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie . I thought Uwe Boll 's alone in the dark was the worst i 've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion(Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit ) . Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne , Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing.<br /><br />Now to the plot , this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they 've could have done better . The start looked OK but that 's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death 's where boring . I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths . I 'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this . Sorry for rambling but there 's nothing good to say about it , because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this .. this .. thing of disaster . Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.<br /><br />Well sorry i could n't explain the plot(if there was one ) but that was the best i could . Now if you do n't mind i 'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life .... OK not for life
0 This film is so bad it simply defies reality . The filming is grade school material at best , the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form . So bad it ca n't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of Showgirls . The ONLY thing this DVD had going for it was the cover art . < br /><br />All I can write to those of you who have n't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and do n't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage . If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects , there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash .
0 I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library . Nothing against low budget movies , but this movie has horrible acting and directing . How can a movie as this one ever be made . The director should be blacklisted , and for all the poor actors , it is for sure not a jumping board into a career . Please make sure that you 'll not watch this movie , the acting is lame , the camera and directing awful . There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the " LOW 10 " . Another example would be " Dracula 3000 " . People who make money with this movie should give it to charity , so at least it serves for a good reason . < br /><br />In this case I would watch it even another 10 ( or at least one more time ) .
0 Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE SCHOOL . Who ever told him HE knew HOW to make a movie ? Can just ANYBODY make movies these days ? In the past , it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie . After watching this lame BTK movie and the others he 's made , it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as I DO . Actually I think even I could make better movies than Uli LAME - ALL . This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the BTK Killer , other than the names of the victims and the killer . THAT 'S IT . Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that 's in the movie ? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term " BTK " because of the fame it has achieved . Absolutely pitiful . The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is that lame " DAHMER " movie . That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous . Whoever made that one needs to be shot .
0 I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie . I thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better . The acting , the music drowning out the actors . Horrible . Save your money ! You have to read the movie all the way through b\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines . I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered . What did that have to do with the " real " BTK killer ? I understand why there were no famous actors\actresses in this movie . The script would have turned me away within the first page of reading . You would be better off watching paint dry .
0 This movie only got a 1 because you ca n't give a zero ! if you have a weak tummy AT ALL do n't watch . animal rights people you do n't want to watch either . it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen ! the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story . its really really super creepy that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people ! still feel safe when you punch in that little code ? i do n't ! He had access to every code in Kansas ! ! ! ! ! ! I hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring ! Do your self a favor and don;t rent / buy this movie i think it cost about $ 20 to make that INCLUDES their OVER paid actors ! ! ! !
0 It 's made in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie made in 1998 . At one part in the movie there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good , but this just makes the extremely amateur work on the CG stuff look even worse.<br /><br />The writing , acting , directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible . This is as bad as , if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap ! Again , as with the other movies , the only scary part about this movie is that it actually got made and is now being aired on the sci - fi channel.<br /><br />I still ca n't understand how they somehow get people who do have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get them to act as terrible as everyone else in the movie.<br /><br />For those of you who are unsure , the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review ... or he is one of the people who worked on this movie .
0 This has to be one of the worst movies of all time . The graphics were horrendous , the acting was b - movie and the effects were just plain Nintendo 64 qualified . You would think that they would put a little more effort into it . Of course , it is a Scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate , but this one takes the cake . Hell , I 'm still laughing . So , as a shake - your - head in disbelief movie , this one does well . < br /><br />Although it appears to have some ' known ' actors and actresses in this , it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort . < br /><br />The graphics might have been good in the ' 60 's or even early ' 70 's but come on , this is 2009 ! I wo nt give spoilers out , let 's just say that if you have played " Jurassic Park " on the Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film < br /><br />It is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
0 I 've seen plenty of Sci - Fi Channel Original movies ever since I started watching them back in 2002 ( My first one was Sabretooth - which actually is one of the more entertaining Sci - Fi Channel features in my opinion ) . Their quality varies . Some of them are average but decent ( Sabretooth , Dragon Fighter , Never Cry Werewolf , Swamp Devil ) , some are laughably bad , and then there are some that are truly terrible . Raptor Planet lies in the latter . < br /><br />Raptor Planet , a loose sequel to the 2004 Sci - Fi Channel Original Raptor Island , is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting . The effects that bring the dinosaurs to life ( a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as CGI and stock footage from Raptor Planet ) are some of the worst looking effects I 've seen in a low budget film . The gore effects are even unconvincing . < br /><br />The plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason ( I forget why ) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs . That 's right folks , the dinosaurs are aliens . Dinosaurs in outer space . What 's next , sharks in space ? ! ? The rest of the plot is simple . The human cast are picked off and eaten . By now , we 've come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released , but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I 've seen where I actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks.<br /><br />There are a few chuckles in it though . There 's one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a Carnotaur ( brought to life by stock footage from the original film ) that seconds later becomes a giant raptor . Also , a bit of trivia , this is the scene where Steven Baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie . < br /><br />While Raptor Island was n't a good film to begin with , its a masterpiece compared to its sequel.<br /><br />Believe me when I say , this is quite possibly the worst movie Syfy has ever aired . It 's darn near unwatchable .
0 So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert 's book " I hated , hated , hated this movie " and he gave this one a rare zero - star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review " Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor " . So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was . I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert 's review of Rob Reiner 's " North " where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review . Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I do n't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well . But above all the other things that were awful about this " movie " I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all . While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss 's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits . But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot . Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill . Haha . Not funny . Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra 's " My Way " sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss . Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die . Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny ? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny . Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss ( who I admire much as an actor ) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that " Independence Day " was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history . Did Goldblum feel that " Independence Day " would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if " Independence Day " were a bomb ? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this ? The opening sequence of " Mad Dog Time " says that the movie is set on another planet . I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back . Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid . Every copy of " Mad Dog Time " should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire . I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it 's honor as the worst movie ever .
0 " Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy " whatever you wanna call it ... simply does n't hit the mark . Maybe its just me , maybe i just do n't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar , Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It 's probably more " witty sharp wordplay " than all out Comedy , only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers ) Make it out to be . < br /><br />The Rick , Mick , Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch . < br /><br />There was n't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in . The Majority of the film was either set in " Dreyfus 's Club " or a variety of Offices /dim rooms ... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ? ) < br /><br />The supporting cast was ... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop . and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke ! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down.<br /><br />4/10 I do n't think i 'll return to it anytime soon .
0 Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind , but now he 's " fixed . " Lane is his girl who 's been messing around with his Number One ( Goldblum ) , who 's supposed to have something going with Lane 's sister ( Barkin).<br /><br />With what anyone could consider an all - star supporting cast ( Burt Reynolds , Gabriel Byrne , Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor ) ca n't help this plot , as Dreyfuss proves he 's not " fixed " and tries to kill just about everyone in sight.<br /><br />You know , it 's not like you did n't know what was coming . The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss gets out , but I 'll save you all the trouble : skip this movie.<br /><br />The actual reason I picked this movie is because I 've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies . The real let - down for me was n't just the terrible plot , but also the fact that she does n't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie ( although we hear about her all through the movie ) . Even being a fan of over half of the cast ca n't help me enjoy this film . The parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on.<br /><br />3 out of 10 stars .
0 Vic ( Richard Dreyfuss ) is a mob boss , leaving a mental institution , back to his world of gangsters . How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss , Ellen Barkin , Jeff Goldblum , Diane Lane ( very gorgeous ) , Gabriel Byrne , Gregory Hines , Kyle MacLachlan , Burt Reynolds , Billy Idol and a make such a waste of time ? This movie is a comedy that is not funny , having a constellation in the cast . My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : ' Prazer em Matar - te ! ' ( ' Pleasure in Killing You!')<br /><br / >
0 This is is a thoroughly unpleasant , if slickly made , movie . I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum , two good actors , and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising . The movie is billed as a comedy , sorta . What we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant , if somewhat surreal , interiors , shooting each other - in the head , stomach , kneecap , foot , heart ( no part of the anatomy is avoided , it seems ) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue , some of which is supposed , evidently , to be humorous in a sort of post - modern way . Goldblum 's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card , and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout . Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can . Burt Reynolds does a cameo . The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop , but I somehow missed them ( good move on their part ) . The whole thing is cold , sterile , mechanical and unsavory ; an heir , I suspect , to the style of ' Pulp Fiction ' , ' Fargo ' and ' Natural Born Killers ' . If you liked those , you 'll probably like this .
0 There are often badly - matched couples ( in the general sense of the term ) -in Huston 's movies : " African Queen " " Heaven knows Mister Allison " " roots of Heaven " " Misfits " ... " The Barbarian and the geisha " ( check the title ) is another good example , so to speak . It seems that Japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as " Sayonara " " the world of Suzie Wong " and " the teahouse of the August moon " bear witness . Huston 's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot(with the exception of " Susie " maybe).John Wayne perfectly fits in Ford 's world , in Huston 's he 's like a bull in a china shop . His Japanese partner is totally bland . Even the dramatic scenes ( cholera epidemic ) do not save the movie from absolute boredom.<br /><br />Only those utterly enamoured of Huston 's every work need to choose this , among all his other great movies around .
0 If I had realized John Wayne was in this movie , I would not have watched it . It 's demeaning to the Japanese , unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person . But then , most John Wayne movies are like that . Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved Americans when the truth was ( and still is ) somewhat different . The movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of Japan . Maybe it 's Hollywood that should be isolated . To put it as succinctly as possible , this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap.(Sort of a Madama Butterfly with bad music . )
0 A comparison between this movie and ' The Last Detail ' is made by some , but ' Chasers ' is flatter than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas . And like the scenery in the desert , there 's nothing much to distinguish it , not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around . No one in the cast comes off too well ; with this lame script that 's not surprising . Dennis Hopper , the director , wo n't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir , I do n't think .
0 ... so I thought I 'd throw in a few words about William McNamara . Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty - whities -- it 's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less . There 's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies . There 's a nice bit where he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the buff , with only his hands cupped over his groin . William McNamara is naturally a little on the skinny side , but he has a nice , generous handful of a booty . Also , there 's a moment when he 's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada . If you 're inclined to do so , and come on , half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a " road trip " are . I 'd just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity . Can William McNamara act ? Heck if I know .
0 This is simply the worst movie I 've ever seen . Neither of the three central characters has any charm , and Erika 's good looks are n't enough to carry the film . The lamest plot I 've ever had inflicted upon me . Also the most unconvincing military comedy ever . Why did they bother ?
0 What a dreadful film this is . The only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the pleasurable sight of Miss Eleniak . The painful overacting of Mr McNamara , which became embarrassing at times , ruined what might have been a reasonable film if the correct actors had been cast . Mr McNamara is no Tom Cruise , the actor he obviously wants to be .
0 This movie down - shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd , grinding gears all the way to the sappy , b - movie finish - line . The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie . That is worth seeing . The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast , you may miss it . Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad - to - mediocre confusion . There is no real conflict , and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character , Al . I wonder if he 's got a job for me in Cincinnati ?
0 This is one of the very worst films Clark Gable made . Only PARNELL was obviously worse . It is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of making.<br /><br />Gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going ' to the slammer ( like the gangster talk ? ) . She holds out hope that he 'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there -- unknown to either of them , gosh , that she 's " in the family way " . Eventually , the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending ! They seemed to have forgotten about Gable 's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow . Leonard Maltin says " the stars are at their best here " . By what standard ? Best at producing unintended chuckles ? Gimme a break!<br /><br />PS -- after saying this , my wife thinks Leonard Maltin is going to find me and kick my butt . Hmmm . However , despite my comment , I think Mr. Maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet ( I hope that appeased him).<br /><br />UPDATE--2/2/08 . Because I disliked this film so much the first time ( especially the ridiculous ending ) , I decided to watch it once again . After all , sometimes when I watch a film again I like it much more and realize that I was a bit too harsh . While that has been the case with several films in recent months , I still disliked this film -- even the second time . Most of it was not because of the first half of the film . In the first half , Harlow 's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable . But when she was sent to prison , it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred . The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb -- it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons . I stand by my original review ( despite all the " NOT HELPFULS " ) and think that aside from PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT THE CIRCUS , it might just be the worst Gable film .
0 Oh yes , Sakura Killers is a goofy , horrible ninja movie , make no mistake . But it 's also an incredibly enjoyable one . This is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one Chuck Connors , who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes . I suppose he 's supposed to be sort of an Obi Wan Kenobi type ( " The tough ninja - buster " , the box copy exclaims ) but his ' wisdom ' is laughable . " Move without thinking " ? ? ? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation , not of supreme concentration.<br /><br />But really , his two aides , Sonny and Dennis , have such horrible dialogue that ' Brooklyn ' , as we call The Colonel , tends to shine in comparison . Especially watch for Dennis ' logic regarding the ' genetic splicing ' the Sakura are involved with . If you know anything about cloning you will die laughing . And yes , this is a major plot point , folks.<br /><br />A terribly fun movie , Sakura Killers is a hard - to - find gem . I wo n't spoil the ' trick ' ending for you either , except that it 's a perfect set up for a Sakura Killers 2 . Too bad Chuck Connors died . :-( Because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas .
0 I 'm in awe ! Wow , prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja . Watch them as they pounce , crawl along the ground ( on their backs or stomachs ) like a caterpillar , fly through the sky , climb buildings , hide and spring from trees , throw about ninja stars , role out blue welcome mats , disappear in smoke bombs , make a lot of swoosh noises with their blades and quickly sneaking or trotting about on their toes . What a sight ! Really I could go on about the many traditional actions , but I 'll be here all day . Oh not to forget we even get the legendary Chuck Connors popping up now and again , and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease . What class ! What a badass ! Anyhow the ultra - cheap ' Sakura Killers ' is some stupid , but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b - grade debacle.<br /><br />A genetic lab in America has a very important video that 's stolen by a couple of ninjas . Two Americans are sent to Japan by the Colonel ( Chuck Connors ) to retrieve it.<br /><br />The opening of the feature sets it up nicely . Get ready for the laughs ! Afterwards it slows down , but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula . This is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play . It 's not too shoddy either , ( like the moronic script and daft performances ) . The final climatic showdown is very well done.<br /><br />In the slow stretches it has the two Americans ( Mike Kelly and George Nicholas ) looking in to the case , sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems . What made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were . These were supposed to be professional killers ? Director Dusty Nelson ( ' Effects ( 1989 ) ' ) does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is . He centres the on - screen activities around striking Taiwan locations . The score is a chintzy arrangement .
0 SAKURA KILLERS ( 1 + outta 5 stars ) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool ... if you had never ever seen a * good * ninja movie . Cheesy ' 80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy acting ... and way - beyond - cheesy martial arts sequences . The coolest scene is at the beginning ... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice ... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and ... naw , I wo n't spoil it for you ... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you 'll thank me . The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something . A bunch of dim - bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because " only a ninja can fight a ninja " or something like that . Strange , these guys do n't seem to fight any better after their training than before ... oh well , the movie does move along pretty briskly . The fight scenes may not be great .. but they are plentiful ... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles .
0 Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape , which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie . First they just have to learn some ninja skill , because " only ninja can beat the ninja." < br /><br />Sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja - flick but fails that badly . The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it : Same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before , characters are too briefly drawn , direction is dull and script does n't offer anything surprising , even in the ending scene , which by itself reduced movie 's ( trash)value.<br /><br />Even 80 's ninja - flick - fan , who understands the esthetic of trash - movies , is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable . It simply does n't offer anything new to viewer , neither in visual level nor in plot . Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging , but it 's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />It 's hard to recommend movie to anyone . Even Franco Nero 's clumsy performance in " Enter the Ninja " falls behind Sakura killer 's American - ninjas . Even in visual level movie does n't have any balls and it 's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie : There is n't any . In all , one of the most futile ninja - flicks , I 've ever seen . Does n't interest even in curiosity . Trust me on this one.<br /><br />½ out of 10 .
0 This movie 's one of my favorites . It 's not really any good , but it 's great to laugh at . The dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted ( eg , " Manji , can we ask you a few questions ? " " Sure . " " We think you can help us with the answers . " ) Any fighting is more or less surrealistic . Make sure to watch for Brock , the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters . He only has two lines , but he 's one of the best guys in the movie !
0 Skip Mission : Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead . The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode . Although Galactica suffered from network - controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production , Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series . Fire in Space , on its own , is one of the worst episodes . As a historical note , watch Galactica , the original Star Trek , and then the revival Trek series , and you 'll see the difference in quality between network - produced sci - fi and syndicated sci - fi .
0 The Derek 's have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title " worst movie of all time " , and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes . In fact , this film can be regarded as belonging to the " so bad , it 's good " category , right up there with the products of the likes of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman . This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marks.<br /><br />Anthony Quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time , but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad , it has to be seen to be believed .
0 I saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf . And before i got my first VCR I figured I 'd christen it with this little gem and it 's bad film - making at it 's finest!<br /><br />The dialog is inadvertently hilarious . And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump . Anthony Quinn is in it inexplicably . And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years . This movie is Mr. Quinn 's Country Bears.<br /><br />It features lines like , " Shut up and let me FIGHT!!!" < br /><br />And " You 're saying a lot of sh_it ! " < br /><br />And the priceless comeback : " Unfortunately it is sh_it , tough angry sh_it!" < br /><br />You'll be awed by a fight scene as Bo does a SOMMERSAULT across a billiard table ! And does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll ! Chop socky action and T and A thrills!!!<br /><br />What schlock movie fan could ask for more ? Oh , and when Mr. Quinn 's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness ? He says , " Real men do n't eat quiche." < br /><br />Uh , aaa , yeah . If Bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there !
0 The Dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for Bo after " 10".<br /><br />I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys . One day , the script for " Ghosts Ca n't Do It " was circulating among the trainers in the " fish house " where food was prepared for the dolphins . There was one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly propositions Bo ( or Bo the dolphin ) , asking to " go make eggs . " Reading the script , we -lauuughed- ... <br /><br />We did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility , although our dolphins -were- in " The Big Blue!" < br /><br />This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn 's life . I hope he had fun in this film , as it certainly did n't do anything for his legacy .
0 I 've now watched all four Bo Derek vehicles directed by her husband , John ; all are quite terrible , of course , but this is certainly the pits . Featuring the usual flimsy plot , bad scripting  by the director , naturally  and acting , not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star , it deals with her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn ( she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired Hemingway ! ! ) but who continues to appear and talk to her . In fact , he wants to come back in another , younger body  but actually does so only in the very last scene ! Derek is lovely as always , and still playing naïve ( ! )  especially during a muddled mid - section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa . Quinn , too , is typically larger - than - life ( read : hammy ) here , but this easily constitutes his nadir ; besides , for much of the duration , he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic ( presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo ) ! His ' replacement ' , then , is obviously a handsome - looking stud who has n't a lick of talent or even personality . Also featured in the cast are Hollywood veterans Don Murray ( as Quinn 's best friend and Bo 's business consultant ) and Julie Newmar ( as Quinn 's guardian angel in the afterlife )  plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump ( who presumably needed this on his resume ' ) ! It also goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer on the film , that the end credits are filled with useless ( and corny ) expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand , and that GHOSTS CAN'T DO IT swept the board at the 1990 Razzie Awards !
0 With a Bo Derek movie , the audience get just what they expect . A paper thin plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek in no clothes . ' Ghosts ca n't do it ' is just that . The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama , as long as Scott [ Anthony Quinn ] is still alive . He is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles , but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes . Bo Derek is the opposite , always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes . The movie is a complete waste of time . If you want to see Quinn , rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada . If you want to see nude women or bad acting , rent any porno movie .
0 Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was " the only film ( he ) did purely for the money " as well as " the worst film he ever starred in " . Hold on , Michael , were n't you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown ? And were n't both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti ? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures ( the director , Richard Fleischer , was hospitalised as a result of sun - stroke during the shoot ) . What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low - point of Michael Caine . Instead , it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast , exotic locations , boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline.<br /><br />Dr . David Linderby ( Caine ) is a W.H.O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa ( Beverly Johnson ) goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village . Linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by Suleiman ( Peter Ustinov ) - and he sets off on a continent - wide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East.<br /><br />Along the way , big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles . William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot ; Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire ; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest . The film is based on a best - seller entitled Ebano , by the little - known author Alberto Vasquez - Figueroa , but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation . Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver ( he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances ) , and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he 'll never see his wife again . There are occasional flashes of action , but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow - moving . All in all , it is a resistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested , but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let - down from all the talent involved .
0 I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it 's better than Caine believes , although it 's not much cop . Britain 's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role , which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing . Rex Harrison seems even less bothered , perhaps unsurprisingly , as his character is very poorly written . William Holden is better , but his screen time is fleeting and , again , his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen , but is given very little to do , the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story . Ustinov steals the show , but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film 's serious tone . The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos ( his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively , he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director , and this is one of his weaker movies .
0 If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery , still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received . Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in , said their lines , and picked up their paychecks without much conviction.<br /><br />Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa . Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer . As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well.<br /><br />Of course Caine does n't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt . The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden , Rex Harrison , Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing.<br /><br />Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery . But Ashanti does n't even have that going for it.<br /><br />What an incredible waste of time . The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air .
0 The worst , and chock full of people who really ought to know better , ( the cast have six Oscars between them ) . It 's set in ' contemporary ' Africa , ( it was made in 1979 ) , and is about the slave trade . It 's appallingly scripted and acted , ( Michael Caine , Peter Ustinov and William Holden reach a career low in this one ) , and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus . It 's also ludicrously plotted . You do n't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances . Richard Fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone . This is as bad as it gets .
0 There seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70 's . And the fact that I can not recollect the title to a single one of them off - hand is a measure of their impact . These are what novelists would call ' pot - boilers ' . They are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping movie - stars in the public eye.<br /><br />We have Micheal Caine , Peter Ustinov , Omar Sharif , Rex Harrison and William Holden ; more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats . Every taste in hero is catered for . Though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed.<br /><br />Their talents are simply thrown away , and I wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense . This sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a CV . Sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round.<br /><br />It was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset . That ludicrously mismatched jaunty - jazz theme music , which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed , had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator Muzak . Who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central Africa , or the endless Sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop ? Definitely a serious goof - ball . Ennio Morricone would have known what to do ; and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points . This director should have taken the trouble to watch ' Lawrence of Arabia ' , or even Sergio Leone 's westerns ; he might have learnt a few things . But then again , probably he wouldn't.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film ' Frantic ' . It was later remade with equal panache staring Harrison Ford . In each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible . Here , when Michael Caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado , Rex Harrison kept popping - up out of no - where like some wily old genii , to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled . < br /><br />At least the photography was rather good , with excellent use of the often beautiful environment . But then the dumb music must pipe - up and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created.<br /><br />Action scenes were also contrived and stilted , with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first - year drama class . And , of course , the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment - as you do.<br /><br />And that 's about as much comment as this item deserves . Except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well.<br /><br />Stick with your hobby on this one . Even if it contained your favourite movie - stars , you 're sure to be disappointed too .
0 The story at the outset is interesting : slavery in the ( late ) 20th century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East . The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleisher 's favorite enemies : Arabs and Germans . To make us believe that very Arab - looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch Blacks in West Africa is as believable as Whites hunting for slaves in " Roots " . Obviously both trades are / were run by locals and involve(d ) much more sophisticated networks . While Arab countries are complicit in today 's child and sex slave trade , Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International . So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer ? It 's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a Jewish director.<br /><br />The acting is above average , especially by Peter Ustinov ( Suleiman ) and Kabir Bedi ( Malik ) . Michael Caine ( Dr. Linderby ) is good as always .
0 I hope the viewer who regards ' Dream Machine ' as one of Corey Haim 's finest and the " best movies of the century " was kidding . Undetected sarcasm on my part ? I sincerely hope so.<br /><br />'The Dream Machine ' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of Corey Haim 's career ( except ' Prayer of the Rollerboys ' which was surprisingly decent ) . Here , Haim plays nonchalant college boy , Bernie , who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl 's attention . Lucky for Bernie , a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband , hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner -- Bernie -- with a gift : a slick Porsche Turbo . However , unbeknownst to the woman , and unfortunate for Bernie , is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk . Now , being that in this movie , bodies do n't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk , Bernie is unaware of this . In fact , the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise . In particular , a grizzly man follows him around , desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected.<br /><br />This is a low - grade action fizzle as many of Haim 's films like this are ( see The Double O Kid ) . Despite being part action , part romantic comedy , this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty - five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem ( i.e. Bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body , and a hit - man finding out that the Porsche is going to be hard to find ) . After which , and thanks to poor acting by Haim ( I loved this kid , too , but it 's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously could n't act well ) and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result , inappreciable . To add injury to insult , the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self - evident songs you would hear in Team America ( see the ' date ' montage).<br /><br />Loyal Corey Haim fans , however , should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance . However , others understanding that Haim 's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered , might expect mediocrity , as will viewers just looking for early 90s b - comedy fluff to pass the time .
0 This week , I just thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim , with just having seen the two " Lost Boys " films last week and all . Not that I 'm a fan - boy - not by far - but I did like those two Coreys in some films back in my early teen days.<br /><br />So , I prepared myself for three films starring him . Unfortunately , I picked " Dream Machine " as a first ( never seen it before ) , and it was so godawfully horrible , I just decided to lock Corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first , before I pop in something else of his . But I managed to struggle my way through this film first . I had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off " ( 1986 ) but got caught up in its own delusions . Practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller . The only good thing about " Dream Machine " is the premise : A dead body in the trunk of a Porsche . All the rest fails so badly , it 's embarrassing . Even the most for Haim . I can dig him being his young , enthusiastic self , but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guidelines . This clearly was n't the case in " Dream Machine " . So , we have a perfect car , yes , that black Porsche . Haim 's perfect girlfriend ? Just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film . The perfect murder ... almost ? Some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film , trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk , never really succeeds , and then at the end of the film thinks he 's Michael Myers ( minus the white William Shatner mask ) and mistakes Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis . Do n't think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried . A stupid , unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that does n't know how to direct his cast . Great accomplishment!<br /><br />One last question for Mr. Haim : Who 's idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie ? Yours or the director 's ? So not done .
0 I 'm a big Porsche fan , and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim , the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80 's is bland as per usual , and commenting on back up from minor characters / actors would be pointless ; needless to say they were all very average . It 's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80 's - with some weird clothes , some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all , please do n't waste your time watching this unless you love 80 's movies , Corey Haim , or like myself , love old school Porsches ( this one in particular looks great ) because life 's too short to watch crappy movies .
0 Well , TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie . It had 2.5 stars . It seemed promising . It went downhill fast.<br /><br />There is much overacting , even from Angelina . She 's about 20 and playing a 16 year old . There are three characters that are supposed to be Italian . Everyone else is Italian- American . The native Italian accents were good , I thought . The young male lead is cute , my wife says . Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman . Even the men.<br /><br />I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a randy doctor , that that was a bad sign . The two couples chasing their kids around are like the four Italian Stooges.<br /><br />My wife would not let go of the remote . Hopefully she was not taking makeup , clothing or decorating tips . It was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish . It was hidegarishous.<br /><br />Cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie . If this movie shows up on your TV , do yourself a favor and ram your head through the TV screen instead . You 'll be glad you did . The only movie I 've ever seen that was worse than this was " Hamburger : The Movie " . Or maybe " Deadly Friend " .
0 OMG this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot I 'm a Film student . I do n't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie ? Did she need the money that badly ? I love AJ and have seen almost everything she s ever been in so i watched this 2 tick another one off . It was SOO bad ! not even good bad , just bad bad . It had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes . I ca nt even say AJ looked good in it because well she did n't . The plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re - telling of Romeo and Juliet then its not . All round disappointing . Maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise I really do n't recommend it .
0 I only saw this movie once , and that was enough for me . The movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho - sadistic violence and very little of anything else . I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second " Night of The Demons ; " and I wanted to see her playing someone normal . Unfortunately , the Tobe Hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot . Zoe , I know where you are now ; hiding from this film !
0 I do n't know much about Tobe Hooper , or why he gets his name in the title , but maybe he should n't have bothered . As another commenter mentioned , there is n't really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre . The plot is incoherent , the Sade sequences are gratuitous , and most of the acting is so - so . Englund was doing his best with weak material , and Zoe Trilling has a really great bottom , but neither is enough to carry this film . This one 's a tape - over . Grade : F
0 The Marquis De Sade , Egypt , ancient Gnostic cults , Robert Englund in a dual role , gratuitous sex and nudity , murder and mayhem ... on paper Tobe Hopper 's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun , entertaining flick given the ingredients . It 's not . It is a plot less , incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment . There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her . That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking . Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness , dream sequences and erotic encounters , intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery . It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness , bad acting , sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.<br /><br />There are n't too many good points . Robert Englund is fun to watch , as always and the lead actress , Zoe Trilling , whilst not very talented , is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore . At least I got to see the movie from which the " When you 're as criminal as I " bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from .
0 Genie ( Zoe Trilling ) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical , bible - quoting archeologist father ( William Finley ) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade ( Robert Englund ) . Englund also plays de Sade in flashbacks , ranting in his cell . Genie is led astray by Mohammed ( Juliano Merr ) , who rides around naked on a horse and Sabina ( Alona Kamhi ) , a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking , which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers , a woman simulating oral sex on a snake , an orgy and her father preaching in the background ! Meanwhile , black hooded cult members decapitate , gouge out eyeballs and slit throats . When Genie is slipped drugs in her tea , she imagines de Sade hanging from a cross , a gold - painted woman in a leafy g - string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes . It 's all because she 's the reincarnation of de Sade 's lost love.<br /><br />This typically sleazy Harry Alan Towers production is redundant , seedy and pretty senseless , but the sets , costumes , cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there 's always something going on.<br /><br />Score : 3 out of 10
0 Tobe Hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer . Like any other horror fan , I loved the Texas Chainsaw , but I think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title , you should have at least more than one hit movie . I ca n't really think of any other movie Hooper has done ( on his own , do n't count Poltergeist ) that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world . And this movie , Night Terrors , just backs up my point.<br /><br />Poor Robert Englund , I give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given . He did what he could . As for the movie itself ? Pure drudge . Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes , a story that must have been penned in an our , and really just awful scenery , music , and cinematography . Nothing in this film is redeemable . Do n't waste your time.<br /><br />Overall , 1 out of 10 . I feel sorry for Hooper , his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started . I hope that he 's able to pump out at least one more good flick , that way he can do his cult status some justice.<br /><br / >
0 This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad . And indeed , we could n't take most of it . There was a lot of fast - forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist ( her name somehow slips my mind at this time ) . CRIPES . I 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times ( I 'm estimating forty or so ) . And I 've never laughed so hard in my life . You see , Englund has this thing for showing off his loins . I last saw the film a couple months ago , but I ca n't stop laughing as I type . Anyway , the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl , Englund riding a horse naked , and some mysterious woman fellating a snake 's head . This is absolute genius . You 've got to see it for yourself .
0 I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting . I never had to read this book ( thankfully ) , or it would have been a painful experience . I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still was n't worth my time , or my friend 's . I think this story is not worth telling . It 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old ( no kidding ) . The lives of the main characters were painful to watch , one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . However , I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story . I 've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn . I 'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given , which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try .
0 Oh , dear lord .... They 've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest.<br /><br />The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski . He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet . Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers ? We 're not really sure.<br /><br />We had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie , and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point . That point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together , and the road itself vanishes . He lives only to be free , and means no ill on anyone . We saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on , even the cops that were chasing him.<br /><br />When he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity . He died like he lived , running wide open.<br /><br />In the remake Kowalski has a whole history ( including a first name , even . ) He 's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy . He is a devoted husband , and excited expectant father . He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery , but they even leave THAT in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers . They even gave the part of " super soul , " the blind DJ ( brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original ) to JASON PRIESTLY ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? Give me a break .
0 Yuck ! And again I say ... YUCK ! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory . The original movie had a lot to say and did n't go out of its way to say it . And , it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest . It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute . The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance . It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry ...
0 Movies like these are to the originals what Album Oriented Rock stations are to what music used to be like - repetitive , boring , and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones . I AM glad that Aragorn was n't typecast as an expectant psycho by this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version , count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version , and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that was n't based on someone else 's ideas , and was n't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day .
0 This is just plain bad . Sometimes remakes , even if they stray from the original , are good on their own . They can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable . This was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be . This was n't any good even standing on it 's own . Viggo Mortenson is a top - notch actor , but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired . The original " Vanishing Point " was such a thrilling , psychological adventure ; this is not an adventure at all , and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever . This was made from a by - the - numbers approach to film - making , stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today 's film - going audience . Basically , they see us as a bunch of idiots . It 's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film , and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily . The manipulative plot devices , the " make - it - obvious - so - they - don't - miss - the - point " aspects , ridiculous dialogue , stereotyped characters , amateurish direction ... <br /><br />This is plain bad ....
0 This is a terrible remake of a marginal , but well liked , movie from the early 70 's . I have seen the original at least 6 times . The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie ' crammed ' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is . Cheesy storyline , which by the way , is completely different than the original . The major government involvement was far - fetched . There is no flow from one scene to the next . In the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up . < br /><br />It only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car . It takes many times longer than that in real life . Car guys notice this stuff . Also , the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet . The fact they are n't ' car people ' is painfully obvious , and their passing will not be grieved . < br /><br />The actors lacked any emotion , everything was cut and dried . One step above a monotone . A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.<br /><br />Last but surely not least , the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 ( ? ? ) . That is total garbage . Can you say aerodynamics , or lack thereof ? ? Hahahaha ! ! This movie is a joke . Do n't waste your time watching this one .
0 This movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original , i suppose . Which is really sad , because at a deeper level , the title ' Vanishing Point ' the original , is so ironic . I 'm sure it was n't intended that way , but the original was filmed in 1970 , and released in 1971 . The REAL ' VANISHING POINT ' was the end of an era , which pretty much ended in the early 1970s . < br /><br />In this remake , all the counter - cultural elements have been stripped away , and been rendered more PC in an attempt to reach a broader audience , presumably . " Sanitized for your Protection " < br /><br />Inserting the American Indian scenes was gratuitous , and the idea of a ' noble purpose ' to the trip was subtraction by addition . I 'm glad I watched it however , it made me appreciate the original that much more . The original is a cult classic and golden . This remake is dreadful .
0 The original " Vanishing Point " was a great flick . Subtle motives , characters that seemed real and spontaneous . The remake was terrible . Preachy , overtly obvious ; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic . The black Charger was cool , but even that could n't rescue this flick . Why stick with a white Challenger ? I did n't think that was the best choice back in ' 71 . Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious . Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his " Dream Quest " . His Indian pal was standing next to him . Vigo was only wearing his white briefs . I 'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his Fruit of the Looms . Another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph . Then he mentions that the cops said his remains were n't found because he vaporized , but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd . Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph ! First of all , you could n't open the car door at 180 mph . Secondly , the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds . with nobody to steer it . It would promptly roll over about 30 times . Thirdly , if you hit the pavement at 180 mph , you would wind up in various squishy pieces . No matter , we see him at the end standing with his daughter . All in all , a movie that would insult anyone 's intelligence .
0 Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning . As an example , Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds . Why ? They were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive.<br /><br />This film has absolutely no substance . The Viggo Mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero . Why ? He speeds along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking . No one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone . Even worse , when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red - neck terrorist , no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends.<br /><br />Jason Priestley co - stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero.<br /><br />The ending is absolutely unbelievable .
0 Some might say something like " Baby Geniuses " with its giant robot infants or " Dumbo " with its psychedelic drug - addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children . You might say that too , but you 'd be wrong . Lo and behold , for I bring to you : Santa Claus , the most helplessly messed up family film since ... well , ever . < br /><br />From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs ( seriously , this segment is nearly 20 freakin ' minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot ! ) to the thrilling conclusion in which Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day ( do n't mind him , he 's from Barcelona ) , this is childhood trauma at its finest . And no matter how hard I try , no matter how many different therapists I visit , I just ... ca n't ... get ... those ... reindeer's ... laughter ... out ... of ... my ... head ! < br /><br />Avoid this mind - bending piece of trash like you 'd avoid a sex - starved whale during mating season . Still , if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you , I guess you should give it a try . But really , this movie is n't worth your time and mental health .
0 This film is awful . Give me the dentist anytime ! Can you believe that one of the main TV stations here in Arabia had this as their Christmas film ! I can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with Dudley Moore rather than this . The last time I looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting , better plot , more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid . Do n't even watch it if you 're drunk !
0 This has to be creepiest , most twisted holiday film that I 've ever clapped eyes on , and that 's saying something . I know that the Mexican people have some odd ideas about religion , mixing up ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology . But their Day of the Dead is n't half as scary as their take on Santa Claus.<br /><br />So .. Santa is n't some jolly , fat red - suited alcoholic(take a look at those rosy cheeks sometime ! ) . Rather , he 's a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in Heaven(or the heavens , whichever ) , with a bunch of kids who work harder than the one 's in Kathy Lee Gifford 's sweat shops . They sing oh - so - cute traditional songs of their homelands while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there was n't a little African - American boy in black face singing ' Mammy ' . This Santa is a Peeping Tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his ' eye in the sky ' . This is so he can tell who 's been naughty or nice(with an emphasis on those who are naughty , I 'd bet).<br /><br />There 's no Mrs. Claus , no elves(what does he need elves for when he 's got child labor ? ) and the reindeer are mechanical wind - up toys ! This floating freak show hovers on a cloud , presumably held up by its silver lining.<br /><br />Santa 's nemesis is ... the Devil ? ! What is this , Santa our Lord and Savior ? Weird . Anyhoo , Satan sends one of his minions , a mincing , prancing devil named Pitch , to try to screw up Christmas . Let me get this straight - the forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday ? Seems kind of redundant , does n't it?<br /><br />Pitch is totally ineffectual . He tries to talk some children into being bad , but does n't have much luck . I was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl Lupe , who 's family is very poor . All that she wants is a doll for Christmas , but he parents ca n't afford to buy her one(they spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of ) . So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll . In reality , that 's the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll , because being saintly and praying to God and holy Santa does n't really work . But Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to get thee behind her , and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it 's Chucky 's sister.<br /><br />Along the way Pitch manages to get Santa stuck in a tree(uh - huh ) from whence he 's rescued by Merlin ! Merlin ? You have got to be kidding me ! Since when do mythical Druidic figures appear in Christmas tales , or have anything to do with a Christian religion ? And does n't God disapprove of magic ? They 'd have been burning Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago , not asking him to come to the rescue of one of God 's Aspects(or that 's what I assume Santa must be , to be going up against Satan ) . This movie is one long HUH ? from start to finish , and it 'll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank was n't spiked or something . Probably it was , since this movie is like one long giant DT .
0 All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains . Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM , I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie . As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it . I 'll tell you , usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food , but not for this movie . Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next . Would Merlin help Santa Claus ! ? ! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day ? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever seen and I love it for that . :D
0 When I was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had Children 's Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon ( anybody remember those ? ) . They showed this thing one year around Christmas time . Me and some friends went to see it . I expected a cool Santa Claus movie . What I got was a terribly dubbed ( you can tell ) and truly creepy movie.<br /><br />Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician ( do n't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie ) fighting Satan ( some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns ! ) . The images had me cringing in my seat . I always found Santa spooky to begin with so that did n't help . The guy in the Satan suit did n't help . But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled Santa 's sled . When he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements -- I remember having nightmares about those things ! All these years later I still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what I saw . My friends were sort of frightened by it too . I just saw an ad for it on TV and ALL those nightmares came roaring back . This is a creepy , disturbing little Christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it . Avoid this one -- unless you really want to punish your kids . This gets a 1 .
0 While " Santa Claus Conquers the Martians " is usually cited as one of the worse films ever made , this Mexican - made film from 1959 is so bad it makes " SCCM " look like " It 's a Wonderful Life . " You have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking ; perhaps they meant it as a third - world allegory about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption . Nah . . . They just were n't very good . The same production company made an even more disturbing version of " Little Red Riding Hood " in which the wolf 's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia . ( Perhaps this was the inspiration for " Freeway . " ) Back to " Santa Claus " : instead of the North Pole , Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit ( shades of " MST3 K " ) ; instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world ; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice . The result is like an Orwellian outer space sweat shop . It 's enough to turn you off Christmas forever . This and other low - rent Mexican children 's ' films were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the U.S. in the early 1960s ; no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in American history . The baby boomers who were forced to endure these " family " films as children would be all too eager to turn revolutionary .
0 Before I 'd seen this , I had seen some pretty bad Christmas films . But once I saw this , " Jingle All the Way " looked better than " The Godfather " . " Santa Claus " is a jolly film about Santa helping out some kids , but it almost feels demonic watching it . Santa 's jolly ho - ho - ho is replaces by an evil , devilish laugh that I 'm sure has turned many kids off of Christmas . The plot of this massacre is very strange , which fits along with all of the performances and dialog . Santa lives high above Earth in the North Pole where he , and kids from all around the world get ready for Christmas . But Santa has an enemy named Pitch , or Satan . Pitch tries to ruin Santa 's Christmas by making three boys naughty , and by creating diversions , like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot . When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog , it 's up to Santa 's helper Pedro and Merlin the wizard to get Santa out of this pickle . < br /><br />Everything about this film , along with being downright bad , is so bizarre . Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than Santa . Santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls , yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in Mexico . The reindeer are wind up toys , and when the reindeer laughs , I 'm amazed it does n't bring tears to kid 's eyes ... it 's frightening . Everything is terrible . The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organ while kids sing to it . Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the butt with a mini - cannon and uproariously laughing about it while Pitch dances around in pain . I think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from , than showing them this . The only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema.<br /><br />My rating : BOMB/****. 85 mins .
0 Its hard to make heads or tails of this film . Unless you 're well oiled and in the mood to mock , do n't view Santa Claus . It mixes Santa , Satan , Merlin , and moralizing in a most unappetizing way . It certainly is not for fretful children .
0 The NSA , CIA , FBI , FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people . ( as MST3k Commentary states it ... "Sanata has the dirt on every ! Santa 's Tentacles reach far and wide ! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization")<br /><br />From telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything . Its amazing that the CIA does n't have Santa on the payroll . < br /><br />Satan 's dance routine is hilarious . Pitch ... he is so useless.<br /><br />The cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous . Very low budget but so fun to watch . I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.<br /><br />You even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.<br /><br />I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor .
0 Wow . Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anybody ? This steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point ; it makes " The Violent Years " look like " Casablanca " ! " Santa Claus " also makes Keith Richards ' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission . I 've had nightmares , you know , waking up and sweating bullets , that will never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being . However , I can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well . Also , if you 're looking for the perfect example of a Santa - Satan dichotomy on VHS tape , look no further . Do n't check out this movie , as I 've been notified the MST3 K version is now available . Move over Satan , here 's " Santa Claus " .
0 This Santa movie starts off strange and I think Santa might be a pedo . Instead of the usual elf toy makers , this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from " It 's a Small World " ! I guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives ( it 's apparently NOT the North Pole and not on Earth ) ! ! None of these kids seem very happy and I kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes , though I guess for some of the third world kids , these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops . I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys.<br /><br />Then , the scene abruptly changes to Hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a Busby Berkeley musical . This fun in put to a stop by Satan who orders one of them , Pitch , to go to Earth to ruin Christmas ! ! Personally , I thought this movie already did that ! The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cute -- like Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees ! Or , if you are Puerto Rican , like a vejigante mask with a goatee ! < br /><br />Somehow a poverty - stricken Mexican kid named Lupita , a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa ! ! So , if the Prince of Darkness ( not Donald Trump , it 's the OTHER Prince of Darkness ) can somehow make her steal and be bad , he 'll ' win'--what , we do n't really know ! In fact , as they root her on , you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesus -- as he has all these great powers AND fights the Devil over kids ' souls ! Later , Santa meets with his friend , Merlin . He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams . Considering how much Santa laughs in the film ( like a demented chipmunk ) , I assume he must use this drug A LOT ! He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors . Considering he keeps kids as his personal ' assistants ' , this magic key thing worries me immensely ! During Santa 's Christmas Eve ride , you see Lupita behave like a little angel -- one problem down . Santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks . He gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems -- two problems solved . This is a rare case where alcohol / drugs HELP kids and solves problems ! And as for the little muggers , he gives them coal ! Frustrated with his losses to Santa , Pitch then tries to steal the sleigh ( which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer ) . When this fails , he destroys Santa 's stash of ' magic powder ' ! As a result , Santa ca n't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed . Uh , oh ... how can Santa take a detour to the Betty Ford Clinic if he 's stuck up a tree ? ! Will St. Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win ? If you care , tune in and see . However , be warned that the film is bat - crap crazy ! < br /><br />Technically speaking , the film is yecchy . While it is in color , it 's really gaudy . The music is mostly done on an organ -- which , along with bad singing from the kids , produces perhaps the worst soundtrack I 've heard in recent memory . And the story is just incomprehensible and very , very , very creepy . Devils and a Santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep - tastic . It 's a film you should NEVER show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish !
0 This was another obscure Christmas - related title , a low - budget Mexican production from exploitation film - maker Cardona ( NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES [ 1969 ] , TINTORERA ! [ 1977 ] ) , which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the U.S. by K. Gordon Murray . Judging by those two efforts already mentioned , Cardona was no visionary  and , this one having already received its share of flak over here , is certainly no better ! The film , in fact , is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized Mexican horror outings from the era , but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color ( which , in view of the prominence of reds  apart from St. Nick himself , the Devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout , was essential ) . Anyway , in a nutshell , the plot involves Satan 's efforts to stall Santa Claus ' Christmas Eve rendezvous with the Earth 's children ; there is , however , plenty more wackiness along the way : to begin with , our portly , white - bearded and chronically merry man - in - red lives in a celestial palace who , apart from accompanying toy - maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing ( laboriously for the whole first reel ! ) in their native tongue , visits Merlin  the famed magician at King Arthur 's court , here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child - like hopping and mumbling gibberish !  once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible ( by the way , the Wizard 's anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of Dr. Frankenstein in SON OF Dracula [ 1974 ] ! ! ) ; incidentally , by this time , he always seems to have gained some excess weight  so Santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney ! The Devil 's antics ( enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up ) to hold up St. Nick 's delivery program , then , is perfectly puerile : indeed , their tit - for - tat shenanigans resemble an old Laurel & Hardy routine more than anything ! To pad out the running - time , we focus on three sets of children : one , the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for Christmas than their company ( projected as a wish - fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra - large packages ! ) , a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own ( the horned one first tempts her to steal one , then invades the little one 's dreams  to no avail ) and a trio of brats who , egged on once again by Satan , think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves . There is definitely imagination at work here , but it is applied with little rhyme or reason , while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment ( unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure ) well at bay !
0 Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a " Bomb " rating , a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night . I feared the worst knowing its reputation , and it was as God - awful as I 'd anticipated . This is a Mexican - made mess , dubbed into English , and produced by K. Gordon Murray . It 's got terrible sets and effects , and features a rather frightening Santa who does n't operate at the North Pole , but instead from a cloud in outer space , and who does n't have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is . The opening sequence , where St. Nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages , seems to go on forever , and with no story . Obviously , THIS Santa Claus does n't observe the child labor laws!<br /><br />Eventually we get some nasty and slinky red - suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth , just to make little kids naughty and turn Santa 's Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare . Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience , and it 's bound to frighten little children and turn them off Santa Claus and the holidays forever . Oddly , the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas film , which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on . This easily makes my personal list of the " Worst Movie I 've Ever Seen " , but I 'm sure that 's nothing unique .
0 Why such a generic title ? Santa Claus ? ? ? So bland and unpredictable . Movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit , most notably ' Santa Claus Conquers the Martians ' , at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it , and all the stock footage being used ... for some reason , that seemed happy to me . But this movie just screws Christmas in the butt , and screws the joy of all the kids . Santa lives in space ? His enemy is a devil named Pitch ? Santa gets help from Merlin the Magician ? How random is this ! ? Well , since it was made in Mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made . I had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time . It was a all - out cluster of madness ! Though , despite all the troubles with the movie , it still feels like a Christmas movie . Good conquers evil , and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world , or possibly universe , thanks to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians .. apparently . So , I think you should give it a try , even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... though it should put a smile on your face any day .
0 This is perhaps the creepiest display of Santa Claus ever committed to any medium , whether it be a book , a picture , or a movie . Santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing Merlin in to help him defeat one of Satan 's minions , Pitch , does n't make things any better . It 's laughable to say the least , with bad effects , even for 1959 standards . If a kid were to watch this movie , he 'd have nightmares and never want Santa to visit . They 'd be scarred for life . Imagine the kid 's in " A Christmas Story " when they start screaming after being put on Santa 's lap . That 's how this would turn out if kid 's see this movie .
0 I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's / early 70 's whenever it reared it 's head like a reindeer with rabies every November - December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show . It was always stiff competition for THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T ( oops - can I SAY " Christmas " ? ) , perhaps the greatest , most iconic Christmas - season film of all time . But that 's another review.<br /><br />At the time , I marveled that the on - screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost " pink and white " , so much had the color of the sprocket - torn prints changed color.<br /><br />The film is kinda creepy ! I thought so then -- and still do , actually . I was highly entertained then , as I still am ! It 's amusing in a " retarted - elf " sort of way . By the way , the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater , circa 1969 - 74.<br /><br />If you are expecting maybe " the lost RANKIN - BASS Christmas special - forget it ! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas -- read on ... <br /><br />By nature , the dubbing on these foreign films ( the original version here was in Spanish)always makes them seem " surreal " . This adds to the films inherent oddness . It is also pretty scary in that a " mishevious demon " ( as described in the original US trailer ) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids " evil " . One particularly nightmarish scene has a young " latch - key " boy wishing he had parents for Christmas - suddenly the " port - a - family " emerges out of giant " Christmas presents - of - the - mind " until he realizes he 's just daydreaming ! See this , Christmas lovers -- and if you 're a stoner , save your stash -- this film will make you think you 're hallucinating ... without drugs !
0 I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old . My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS . She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch . This movie , however , scared the hell out of me . You may be asking yourself , how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone ? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions , Pitch , to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas . That 's right , Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause . Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day , for if Santa does n't make it back to his home in space , he turns to powder . Do n't get me wrong , the movie is funny and fairly entertaining , however , the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell ( which occurs at the beginning of the movie ) is just downright creepy .
0 Believe it or do n't , i have my very own DVD copy of this " movie " which i bought at Walgreens for a great big whole dollar . I 'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.<br /><br />Pretty amazing set designs and costumes . Apparently much thought and effort went into their making . The set designs are very Mexican in stylization . I liked them a lot . And Santa is impressive . One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom.<br /><br />I'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience . But , somehow , it comes across quite deranged . In fact , i 'm left stunned at how deranged it is.<br /><br />Maybe it 's the English dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre . One of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness . The kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very , very weird.<br /><br />Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns ? You did n't ? Neither did i until i watched this movie . One learns something new everyday.<br /><br />Is this movie actually worth watching ? Now , that 's a tossup . I ca n't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it 's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way . Yet , its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching . You decide what you 're going to do . I dunno ... for myself , it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves . Now , that 's just wrong ...
0 This is kind of a weird movie , given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his minions ... but it 's still kinda fun.<br /><br />It has some genuine laughs ... whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable , though . This movie is not good , but I can say I really enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie over " Santa Claus Conquers the Martians " , " Santa Claus " with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow , or " The Santa Clause " with Tim Allen .
0 This movie is supposed to be a " lighthearted " tale about Santa Claus and his " magical and mystical " wonders . But instead it comes off as being downright creepy . Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 ) the way Santa looks.- Have you ever seen a more horrible looking Santa Claus ? and 2 ) the " evil rep . of Satan " Pitch 's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch . Only watch this movie if it happens to be the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh . I ca n't believe this is a children 's movie .
0 I 'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film , but one word could suffice : bizarre . Hubby and I did n't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie . We kept looking at each other with our best " What the ... ? " expressions . There is no way to adequately describe this movie . Killer tomatoes were funny , but this is just sick . What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see ? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird , weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children ? Parents , whatever you do , if your child still believes in Santa , do n't let him / her see this movie . Preteens can watch it -- probably with " What the ... ? " expressions on their faces . If you decide to inflict this movie on others , you might want to spike their eggnog.<br /><br />Quite possibly the worst film ever made .
0 Yes I have rated this film as one star awful . Yet , it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies henceforth . This truly is so bad it 's good . This is another K.Gordon Murray production ( read : buys a really cheap / bad Mexican movie , spends zero money getting it dubbed into English and releases it at kiddie matinées in the mid 1960 's . ) It 's a shame I stumbled on this so late in life as I 'm sure some " mood enhancers " would make this an even better experience . I 'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said , a Christmas movie with Merlin , the Devil , mechanical wind - up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors I have ever seen bar none . I plan on running this over the holidays back to back with Kelsey Grammar 's " A Christmas Carol " . Truly a holiday experience made in Hell . Now if I can only find " To All A Goodnight ( aka Slayride ) " on DVD I 'll have a triple feature that ca n't be beat . You have to see this movie . It moves so slowly that I defy you not to touch the fast forward button - especially on the two dance routines ! This thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese - guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience . Feliz Navidad amigos !
0 With title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk . Acting bad . Script bad . Director bad . Grammar bad.<br /><br />Movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell . Movie make bad racial stereotype . Why come every movie with black hero have drug addict ? Why come hero always have to dance to be success ? Why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie ? Why come letter " s " ca n't be in title?<br /><br />Hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper English.<br /><br />Do self favor and not go see .
0 I can always tell when something is going to be a hit . I see it or hear it , and get a good feeling . I did not get a good feeling watching the preview . I was not at all enthusiastic about this film , and I am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films . I was in fact proved right.<br /><br />The first thing that threw me off was the title . Not that I have a problem with ebonics(I am black by the way ) , but for a movie they could have used a better title , and for this time use a title that does n't have bad grammar . I heard the dialog , saw the acting and all I could do was make faces.<br /><br />I also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone . At least " You Got Served " was better than this in my opinion . Even the soundtrack did n't thrill me .
0 " How She Moves " springs to life only when its high - energy , talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera . Otherwise , this stale strive - suffer - and - succeed story is low on energy , low on originality , and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other , likeminded films that have come before it.<br /><br />Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner - city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step - dance competitions , but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction . As noted earlier , the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing , but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting .
0 Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies , and I do not see where all this ' its not that bad ' rubbish is coming from . The acting is terrible , it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other ' dancing ' movies out there . Its terrible ! The name should scream do n't watch . ' How she move . ' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar ? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes , these ones do n't even deserve a watch . I give it a 1 out of 10 , just because there is no zero . I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to watch this , and not to waste your money . The 1.6/10 should tell it all . This movie should not have even be made .
0 This movie was absolutely ghastly ! I can not fathom how this movie made it to production . Nothing against the cast of the movie , of course , this is all the fault of the writing team . You take the old average plot - let 's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or STEP in this case . But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about . With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American setting - this film falls very flat . On a positive note , the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well . Looks like the production budget was very generous as well . My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film . Net result - How she move is How she sucks .
0 We 've been served - a terrible film.<br /><br />Okay , I 'll admit that since I 'm white and have had no practical experience in the " competitive world of step - dancing , " I might not exactly be an authority on this type of film . On the other hand , I do know a bad motion picture when I see it.<br /><br />And , boy , have I just seen it.<br /><br />Filmed in Low - Budget - Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid , ( " A Touch of Pink " ) , " How She Move " tells the tale of how important it is to follow one 's dreams - even if those dreams include bopping around to loud , irritating hip - hop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translator.<br /><br />I'll try to give a small synopsis of the " plot . " First of all there are two actors that look like LL Cool J who work in an auto shop in Toronto ( the Mecca of racial diversity ) , but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day . < br /><br />There are a few other guys in this " crew , " including a token white dude and a guy that looks like Denzel Washington in " Malcolm X. " There are also two women in the movie - one resembles Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old " Flip Wilson Show . " One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drug - addicted sibling . The other girl , a member of Salt N Pepa , no doubt , is just plain no good.<br /><br />There 's another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy 's Buckwheat , while still another actor who 's a Huggy Bear knock - off . These guys are rival step dancers . Evidently , this activity is very hard - core in the ' hood , and they are all practicing for the big " Step Monster " jam in Detroit.<br /><br />Since I was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue ( perhaps some subtitles would have been useful , as in a Bergman film or that one music video by Snow ) , it 's hard to explain what happens , other than there 's a lot of arguing , the Serena Williams girl ( who never smiles , by the way ) becomes a freelance stepper ( moving from group to group ) , there 's some step - dancing and a lot of irritating hip - hop music.<br /><br />It 's a typical rags - to - riches story ; sort of like " Rocky " with a really bad soundtrack , " Rudy " with annoying rap music in the background , " Cry Freedom " without the laughs . < br /><br />But why does a film - which could have made a big impact on black audiences - have to contain drug addiction , bad parents and a title that sounds like a first - grader saying the phrase , " How she moves"?<br /><br />I was " moved " by this movie , however . Moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible .
0 This movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should . Among all the stars you could n't get your kicks from any of the scenes . The movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy . The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves , the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college , and the dialogue is the worse I have seen in a movie . The plot also was worse by ten fold . I 'd stick to the amateur route . The audio commentary was useless since it 's a skin flick but even then that was bad too . Unless your a diehard Jenna Jameson fan there is little here . 4/10
0 I am a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson , but this movie is horrible . At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever . So , of course , Brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film . Now I know why they do n't make big budget porn movies anymore . In a fantasy world , porn stars could act , but this is the real world and they ca n't act . That 's why there porn stars , if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act , then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn . Just because your beautiful does n't make you a movie star . A fine example of this is Traci Lords , when she was a teen thru her 20 's she was one of the most beautiful , sexy women on earth . She made her move into low budget mainstream films and could n't act . Where is she now ? I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot , but there are better movies she has made then " Dream Quest " . Come on Jenna , we do n't want to hear you talk , as much as we want to see you have sex . Also , you Jenna , would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film .
0 Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date . I have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie . It 's just terrible . Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes , take my word for it , the sex scenes are uninteresting at best . Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film ( she does look good ) but it 's all downhill from there .
0 Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly 's clichéd , patchy , overwrought screenplay . Domino Harvey ( Kiera Knightley ) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter . This is her story ... " sort of".<br /><br />The problem with this rubbish is that there is n't much of a story at all and Scott 's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey 's chaotic life.<br /><br />You just do n't care about Harvey . Knightley plays her as an obnoxious , cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect . She punches people she does n't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it , but she is n't the least bit real and Knightly is n't the least bit convincing , either.<br /><br />The film is boring . It 's loud , too , and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I 've heard in a long time . The final twenty minutes are a poor re - run of Scott 's " True Romance " climax with Domino 's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise ! surprise ! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino.<br /><br />Unfortunately , this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing , pretentious , pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation . This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece ; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.<br /><br />Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter , but he disappears into the background as the " narrative " progresses . Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman , always solid , is underutilized.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by this film 's multi - layered , gimmick - ridden surface . It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it .
0 Repetitive music , annoying narration , terrible cinematography effects . Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.<br /><br />One of the best scenes was in the " deleted scenes " section , the one where she 's in the principle 's office with her mom . I do n't understand why they 'd cut that . The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV , and completely not needed or helpful to a movie . Speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used . It 's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they did n't want to throw away.<br /><br />Another movie with Jerry Springer in it ? That should 've told me not to watch it from the preview.<br /><br />A popular movie for the " in " crowd .
0 From the first moment , this " thing " is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work . While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller , the story is so badly told that I 'm unable to buy it . From the middle of the film , the actions of characters do n't make sense to me . Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS.<br /><br />For instance , Ed 's idea to have Edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son 's arm is way below his alleged experience ; it 's just an extremely stupid idea . Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breaking - up phone connection just eludes me ; should n't she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in ? Those FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot - out . Besides , what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder ; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that 's they way the FBI does investigations . In reality , they 'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this . We get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises . Quite the contrary , the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco , which is from Domino 's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.<br /><br />The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want - to - be dramatic razzle - dazzle . This combined with the awful , uneasy camera work just makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie . I 'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors , whose talent is out of question .
0 My flatmate rented out this film the other night , so we watched it together.<br /><br />The first impression is actually a positive one , because the whole movie is shot in this colorful , grainy , post - MTV texture . Fast sequences , cool angles , sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another " Snatch " , for the moment .... <br /><br />When the plot actually starts unfolding , one starts to feel as if one over - dosed amphetamine . things just do n't make sense anymore . i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes , but then again , the film is so bad that you are actually better off NOT watching it.<br /><br />First you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu . WRONG . This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever . Rather on the contrary , Domino 's lesbian come on on Lucy Liu 's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.<br /><br />Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter . In any case , that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes . But after that the question of Domino 's character is entirely lost to the criminal plot . So in short , NO this is NOT a movie about Domino 's character.<br /><br />Then i thought , it 's probably a story of one robbery . A pretty bloody robbery . 10 millions went missing , bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers , mafia kids are executed , hands are removed , Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates , etc . But soon this impression is dispelled by another U - turn of the plot.<br /><br />This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese Afro - American woman , who fakes driver 's licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother . Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show , tries to publicize some new , wacky racial theory , and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.<br /><br />What does this have to do with the main plot ? URgh , well , nobody knows . Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors ' fee of 300,000.<br /><br />Then at some point you start to think : " Oh , it is about our society and the way media distorts things " . There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage . The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors , who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes . But NO , this is not a movie about media , they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.<br /><br />Plus there are numerous other sub - plots : the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan , the love story between Domino and Chocco , the mescaline episode , the FBI surveillance operation ... <br /><br />Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie ? Judge for yourself , but my conclusion is clear - it is a veritable mess !
0 If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage , it must be garbage . This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life . Tony Scott 's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of Domino Harvey 's life as a bounty hunter . The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch . Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable . It seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting . Keira Knightley does get totally naked in this one though . That is the one and only upside to this film . If you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you 'll catch a whole lot of nipple . I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER!</3
0 supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter . I 'd say 95 % is fabricated . I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies , however , this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film , something i ca n't stand , and to top it off , the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head . it 's too incoherent , too flashy and way too boring , it 's a who gives a crap kinda story , and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer 's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat 's life .
0 this film is really bad ....... no i mean really really bad . Tony Scott is a terrible director . out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state , besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time . what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly ( director of Donnie Darko ) did the screenplay to this . now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.<br /><br />now i love Mickey Rourke 's new roles but i ca nt even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it . do n't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few accidence 's in his time and this is one of them . i do n't know what to say about Keira knightly , i think she 's a little too overrated . i just ca nt feel for her in films.<br /><br />all in all this film is bad . that s it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
0 I do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of Direction or Script . As you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone . It is absolutely distracting and without substance , which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie . I do not write many reviews here , but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment . Movies like this erode at Movie making as an Art form . Movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current Reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them . People hone there craft , there 5 senses , and there business sense - overlooking there own inner life . However I do not put blame on them , it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age - qualified by films like this one . But by proxy these Manufacturers I would dare not call Artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen - diffusing it to everyone . A story of bounty hunters , guns guns and more guns , heavy handed flaunting of sex - for the oh so popular actress ( did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her ? ) , over saturated , over exaggerated , one liners , non - linear plots . All different and yet all the same . Annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat . A story ? a development of character ? or just withheld , missing information , revealed at the end to create the * effect * of a story - as if one took place . It altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety . It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre . Where are the films with Awareness ? What about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there ? What about the depth of a look ? What about editing with a point about mind and consciousness ? yes even in action films this can happen . Sure they have honed a craft ; but what use is it without soul or wisdom ? of insight into the human condition ? Can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art , or compare this to Picasso and others - I say put this next to Gandhi or the Godfather , even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings ; then look me in the face and say it again . It is a good crew , but they need some help with depth and story . I hope they get it because I like the crews previous work . better luck next time .
0 It 's rare that I come across a film this awful , this annoying and this irritating . It is without doubt one of the worst films I 've ever seen.<br /><br />The plot , when it 's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing , is ludicrous . Why did Domino become such a bad - ass tough bitch ? Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this " traumatic " event left her emotionally stunted , and hating everyone . When the dialogue is not clichéd or banal , it 's littered with laughable lines such as : " There are three kinds of people in this world : the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else " . At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm . Because of a confusing mobile phone call , instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number , they blow off his arm with a shotgun . At another point , the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go ! ? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast . Mickey Rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess.<br /><br />I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott 's previous films , True Romance being one , but all I could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot .
0 I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews . Normally I see a preview this good and I buy the film outright . Something told me to ... you know watch it first . I 'm glad I did . Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role . In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it . All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it . I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino.<br /><br />Domino who ? Who is Domino Harvey ? I still do n't really know or care . I do n't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film . I did n't care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked did n't make it worth the movie . The direction was definitely lacking . The writing was trite and shallow . The editing was horrible . I do n't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it . There 's a place for it . Good examples of choppy , MTV style , colorful editing ( not sure if there 's an official name ) would be Fight Club ; just off the top of my head . Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts . It was used tastefully and was n't used as a crutch . I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide . Tony Scott please give me my time back.<br /><br />I understand there are many people who liked this movie . I guess the idea that you 'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment . Frankly , I hate it .
0 Tony Scott has never been a very good director , but every film he 's made after " Crimson Tide " seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today ( Michael Bay may fall into the same category , but at least his big , dumb , delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level ) . And like other overblown Hollywood biopics ( " De - Lovely " and " Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , " for instance ) chronicling the lives of pretentious , overrated , or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of " mystique " by a society that thrives on the juicy behind - the - scenes details , " Domino " is a film that begins with little potential , and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty - minute mark . With an already - distended running time of 128 minutes , the film feels twice as long , and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable ( unlike the superior " Rules of Attraction , " Scott 's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via Domino 's smug , self - aware - rich - girl voice - over only draws attention to the film 's sledgehammer cluelessness ) becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable . The story ? Spoiled - upper - crust - babe Domino Harvey ( Keira Knightley , in an ersatz - badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks ) is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles , and accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade ; along the way , there are double - crosses , shootouts , media attention ( courtesy of a tongue - in - cheek Christopher Walken , phoning in his trademark sleazebag ) , and laughable hints at romance . Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds , cranking up the resolution to make the film a neon - drenched nightmare that 's frankly unpleasant to watch -- if Scott 's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image , ghost it , or distort it in some way , he will ; but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot , characterization , and suspense the film has ( to say nothing for its , ehm , " entertainment " value ) . Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical , oftentimes both ( observe the unbearable , several - minute segment where an African - American introduces a new list of racial categorizations on " Jerry Springer " ) , and I found myself wishing they would all get the " tails " end of our protagonist 's coin by the end . " Domino " is utter , unmitigated trash -- whatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience , it is lost in a sea of migraine - inducing neon pretension a few minutes in .
0 What of Domino did I hate over everything , and I mean everything , else ? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter ; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character ; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui ; who deserves a lot better than this junk ; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light can not directly hit with the same dumb look on her face . Maybe it 's the editing ; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they 're uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who , if you buy as a bounty hunter , then you 'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.<br /><br />Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility , absolutely nobody at all . It is a painful and misguided experience , taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them . The principal question is : ' Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy ? ' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she 's coming across as ' tough ' but really , she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school , attempting to impress her peers . There are things you genuinely do n't know how to react to , whether they 're supposed to be funny or not . If it is supposed to be a comedy , that begs the next question : ' Is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs ? ' I do n't think so.<br /><br />The film opens with the title card ' Based on a true story ........ sort of . ' If that 's supposed to be some sort of post - modernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose , then you 're simply on another planet . Truth is , in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying ' sort of ' which I guess is supposed to enable them to make Domino older than she should be and appear on Jerry Springer . Following this , we learn of Domino 's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something ; here is the first use of the ' sort of ' cop out as in real life she was just four . But if the film had gone by reality 's dates then her entire drive would 've been born out of the death of ........ her goldfish.<br /><br />We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey ( Rourke ) ; Domino ( Knightley ) herself and would - be love interest Choco ( Ramírez ) . During the scene , an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son 's life to be spared . What a really misguided opening ; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers , fire off weapons at innocents we do n't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.<br /><br />The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads , a feeling of ' No , why are you doing this ? Why is this happening ? ' Bad seeds are planted and , would n't you know it , they stick . The film is painful to watch , excruciating even ; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210 . Here is another daft post - modernist slant , people playing themselves and that ' sort of ' Joker card being played again . Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jr 's Natural Born Killers character.<br /><br />So as the film plods on and Domino is cast into Ed and Choco 's gang , purely for her good looks I might add , it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver 's registration I.Ds or something that Choco and Domino may have feelings for one another . The problem is , as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character ; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two ; the film is n't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place ? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up ? If there is any ' feeling ' between Choco and Domino , it exists on such a small , tiny , minimalist scale that you have to ask why it 's even included.<br /><br />So then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative - wise . We find out the reason for the fake I.Ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble . The sound proof bubble I can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded ? He must 've swam really quickly  double the speed of the film 's fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second . Yeah , sure . The film 's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up . Plus , there 's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film 's comedy runs SO dry , that it has to resort to the " Jerry , Jerry ! " chant whilst people are on a popular American talk show . When did we last laugh at " Jerry ! Jerry ! " ? when we were , say , seven years old ? I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film 's existence .
0 how can you take her hard - living , glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with * that * accent ? It 's absurd . Apart from that , the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky , the plot is a shallow , boring , confused gangster - movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing . The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused . The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says " that did n't really happen , this happened " - see the ( apparent ) killing of the ( fake ) ' first ladies ' . What have we seen the first , wrong , sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Terrible choice in casting , a convoluted , messy plot and a headache - inducing directorial style . 1/5 .
0 What do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you do n't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget ? Why , you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made ! I 'm referring , of course , to Domino.<br /><br />Here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie:<br /><br />"Ooh , wow , the storyline is told out of sequence , that has n't been done a billion times before . And much more skillfully than in this movie." < br /><br />"Wow , look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions ! The director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style ! It 's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they 're in , and it 's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating!" < br /><br />"I've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before!" < br /><br />"I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before!" < br /><br />"This one too!" < br /><br />"Uh , did n't they reveal this ' plot twist ' about half an hour ago ? Was that supposed to be surprising?" < br /><br />"If this movie is supposed to be showing a ' tough chick ' going around kicking ass ... when why does n't she do very much of it?" < br /><br />"I ca n't believe how unoriginal this dialogue is." < br /><br />"How long is this thing ? I feel like I 've been watching it for over four hours already." < br /><br />"I have no idea what just happened , but also , I do n't particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out." < br /><br />"Is this over yet?" < br /><br />"I want my money back." < br /><br />"The songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here." < br /><br />"It 's ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one." < br /><br />"UGH." < br /><br />And , finally : " I might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me." < br /><br />In summation , this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect . Avoid watching it at all costs . If your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that is n't flammable , you should seriously consider being burned alive instead.<br /><br />(If I sound bitter , it 's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and , uh , I did n't enjoy it very much . )
0 Now I had the best intentions when watching this one . I like some of Tony Scott 's work , also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie , even though I heard otherwise from other people . But this was simply hopeless . < br /><br />In my humble opinion , Tony Scott was trying too hard . It was all just too much . Allow me to elaborate . < br /><br />Miss Knightley was overacting , and not in a good way . The people who did perform well , were Mickey Rourke , Edgar Ramirez , and Christopher Walken , but their screen time just was n't able to save the movie . < br /><br />There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality , yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer . A certain tune was used around 4 times , which really started to bug after the second time . I 'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once . < br /><br />Also , the editing really went out on this one , as the cutting rate is rather high . Oh , and the repetitive echoing of some of Keira 's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second , third , fourth time , and so on . < br /><br />Basically , my opinion is that if you want to see an action - flick that is high - paced and " somewhat " funny , and you do n't care about everything I mentioned above , you might like it . < br /><br />(On a side note : I 'm not a Keira Knightley fan . )
0 I am , as many are , a fan of Tony Scott films . When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like ' Man On Fire ' . To find out that the movie it 's the furthest thing from it ! The story was treading water from the get go , and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea . And the whole ' arm'scene was too gratuitous ! < br /><br />The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly , and this movie reveals that she 'll never become a movie star ! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.<br /><br />I like Tony Scott 's direction ' n all , but this takes the whole friggin cake ! Sorry Ton , 1 out of 10 !
0 This is a bad movie . Not one of the funny bad ones either . This is a lousy bad one . It was actually painful to watch . The direction was awful , with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly . Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all , and I can not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid . The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard . If you have n't seen it , don't . You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults . This one is just a waste of time .
0 I recently viewed Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival . I was drawn to the movie as a photographer because I 'm both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky 's work . While I believe the movie does a good job getting it 's message across , I could n't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by Burtynsky . Obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them . While this is a good effect when used economically , I felt like 75 % of the movie was just stills from Burtynsky 's book ( which I already own ) . That 's probably an exaggeration , but that 's how I felt . If you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one .
0 Beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory , Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies . Its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented , as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum . That there might be a connection between the present - day Asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned.<br /><br />At the same time , there 's an effort to present Edward Burtynsky 's photographs of industrial waste as somehow " beautiful " . Much of the film is a slide show of these images . They are well produced , of museum size , and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions . To me , however , they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented . Industrial waste is still industrial waste . The relationship , if any , between the photographs and the film 's spoken message remains unclear.<br /><br />I do n't mean to imply that there are n't real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize . Manufactured Landscapes , however , offers only strange and bitter hopelessness . It 's like a two - hour lecture by Noam Chomsky . Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what 's wrong with the American ( and Canadian ) Left .
0 The movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers . My , what we 've done to the planet you might think . I hope we get to see other things like this.<br /><br />That 's very rare . When you 're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall , you 're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations . It 'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he does n't . So , then you 'll hear some more narration , watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera . Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead ? It really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk.<br /><br />I could read tips on how someone set up their camera , fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time .
0 I was very excited about seeing this film , anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature , containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of " Rivers and Tides . " However , that 's not what I received . Instead , I get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature . Which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim.<br /><br />The photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed " ethical " duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images , along the periphery . And frankly , the images were not generally that impressive . And according to this " artist , " scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful.<br /><br />In all respects , a stupid film . For people who 'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it .
0 holy Sh*t this was god awful . i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor Oedipus Rex . dear god . this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff . please save your money , this movie can offer you nothing . unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters . you know , h3ll , bring your girlfriend and make things interesting . you will be the only ones there anyway . F@ck this slide show . < br /><br />Ye Be Warned.<br /><br />I recommend not watching this.<br /><br />hello.<br /><br />how are you?<br /><br />I'm pretty good.<br /><br />enjoying this day?<br /><br />I am.<br /><br />this comment was one - hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie . this is sad .
0 That song keeps humming in my head . Not the greatest song , but it 's the 80 's . This movie is about a lead singer who " supposebly " gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band . The lead singer who s name is Billy " Eye " ( yeah , right ) is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time . Billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and makeing people around her think there s something wrong with her and that she s imagining things . She finally decides to go to a cemetary and dig up his grave to see if he 's still there . She sees that he 's dead but still see 's and hears his voice . During the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this , Billy has a brother named John ( right again ) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy . The ending is very cheezy and the acting is very lame and wooden . But .... I like it anyway . I watch it for the song . I wish I had it .
0 A group of people are invited to there high school reunion , but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on . Now , he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines.<br /><br />Dark slasher film with an unexceptional premise . Bringing it up a notch are a few good performances , some rather creative death scenes , plenty of excitement & scares , some humor and an original ending.<br /><br />Unrated for Extreme Violence , Graphic Nudity , Sexual Situations , Profanity and Drug Use .
0 Well , on the endless quest for horror , we will come across this film , apparently re - released on DVD recently for some ungodly reason . The transfer is awful and the quality just sucks . I do n't think this is due to a bad remaster or anything , I just think the film is poorly done.<br /><br />Obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks , " Slaughter High " starts out slow and does n't pick up pace until about an hour in . First , we get to see a ' nerd ' as he is picked on by a group of ... I actually do n't even know what they were supposed to be ... jocks ? The ringleader , with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd . Then , there is a ' big guy ' and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be ' hot ' but are n't . It 's a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own , but I guess the viewer is to assume these are ' cool kids ' picking on a dweeb . The casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty - somethings . As other reviewers on here have pointed out , the actors ( if you can call them that , ) are a bunch of Brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap . We are left to assume that this group of ' children ' were the only students at this school , as their ' reunion ' is only them at the school , which is now shown to be abandoned , is just them.<br /><br />The kills are lame , the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people ; lines like : ' This place gives me the creeps ... ' and ' Someone gimme a beer ' are highlights ... It 's just not good . Skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher . If you wanna see good , get Bava 's " Bay Of Blood , " done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better . If you wanna see a good BAD slasher , see " Just Before Dawn " or " The Burning . " 2 out of 10 , kids .
0 The movie opens with a flashback to Doddsville County High School on April Fool 's Day . A group of students play a prank on class nerd Marty . When they are punished for playing said prank , they follow up with a bigger prank which ( par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds ) goes ridiculously awry leaving Marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough . Fast forward five years , where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion . We find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene , as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious , jester mask - clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind - numbingly ludicrous fashions . It does n't take Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery of the killer 's identity , as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred Marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario . The film takes a turn for the bizarre as Marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors , only to be haunted by their ghosts . Marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life . Finally , the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as Marty wakes up in a hospital bed , breaks free of his restraints , stabs a nurse , and finally disfigures his own face.<br /><br />The script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic . The only originality comes from the mind - numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched . The absurd it - was - all - a - dream ending feels tacked on . It 's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream.<br /><br />Technically speaking , the film is atrocious . Some scenes were filmed so dark that I had to pause the film and play with the color on my television . The acting is sub - par , even for slasher films . I ca n't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray , which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable . Their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them ca n't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie.<br /><br />All of this being said , if you like bad horror movies , you might like this one , too . It is n't the worst film of the genre , but it 's far from the best .
0 Slaughter High is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick . A prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt . A few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him . Now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining , but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors.<br /><br />The acting is horrendous , however , actually not as bad as one would suspect . Though it does n't help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable . The lead , Carol Manning ( Caroline Munro ) is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she 's the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for . Not to mention , the geeky guy is almost too geeky and I think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his , so when he gets mauled , does anyone really care ? < br /><br />There is much unintentional laughter potential . Munro 's lack of acting talent is quite apparent , which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast . However , the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose Munro , who is in her mid 30s at the time , as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers . And then when it comes to later life and Munro is playing around her real age , the rest of the cast do not pass as adults . This all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking " I 'll get you . " With that being said , Slaughter High really is n't a very good slasher flick , but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it . Perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans , but do n't expect dilemma , suspense , or any credibility from it . Horrible ! ! !
0 What a terrible movie . The acting was bad , the pacing was bad , the cinematography was bad , the directing was bad , the " special " effects were bad . You expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher , but even the killings were bad.<br /><br />First of all , the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes . I thought it would never end . They could have removed 80 % of it and explained what happened well enough.<br /><br />Then , the victims were invited to the " reunion " in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on . One of the victims thought this was a little odd , but they dismissed it and decided to break in anyway.<br /><br />Finally , the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchable.<br /><br />There is no reason to watch this movie , unless you want to see some breasts , and not very good breasts at that . This movie makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane .
0 We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust . Maybe that 's a bit hastey but damn if " Slaughter High " was n't terribly unoriginal , even for a slasher flick . Pretty much , the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie - like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former - bullies who all show up to reminisce . As you 'd expect , they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution , burning , hanging , and chemically altered beer . I 've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie , but considering the ending , I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time . Ignore any thought of viewing this movie ...
0 ... but i expected better from Caroline Munro . She 's done some good films , and i was hoping this would be just as good . as a matter of fact , she and this other blonde girl character ( the girl who got electrocuted i think ) were the only two out of the 8 - 11 actors who could act . this film has the worst acting i 've ever seen . almost as bad as ' Psycho ' ( 1998 ) . the really dumb part was when the woman was in the shower and marty rigged it to pour battery acid in there . she starts screaming , and her scream is probably the most annoying sound in the whole world . she attempts to get out , but " accidentally " falls back in . i will admit , the violence and story is good , along with harry manfredini 's music , but the acting could 've been a LOT better . there were two other characters , frank and joe . i do n't know about you , but they bare a strange resemblance to dan akyroyd . also , when they find that woman 's fried corpse in the bathtub , you would think they 'd be screaming and barfing . No . Caroline Munro and the blonde woman are the only ones who react . Frank and Joe barely show any signs of fear or disgust . i do n't know about you , but i know that if i saw a fried skeleton of one of my best friends , i 'd puke . also , when joe starts saying stuff like " what happened to marty was an accident , it was n't our fault . " he says it like his nervous or scared but barely shows any facial expressions . then the blonde girl starts crying and says " i 'm scared frank ! " . and she grabs joe . i guess the actress really did n't know which guy was which . the film 's ending is the most confusing thing i ever saw . more confusing than the climax of " jaws : the revenge " . all the eight friends end up dead , marty kills them all , but then , you see something that looks like him being chased by their rotted corpses , and then it just cuts to marty still in the hospital from the accident , and then when the film ends , marty dresses up as a nurse trying to sedate him , but then we see that marty has gotten into her clothes or somethin like that kills a doctor , and the film ends with marty peeling skin off his face . which leads me to this next question . WHAT WAS THE WRITER ON WHEN HE CAME UP WITH THAT ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened ? ? the ending left me so confused . were the characters still alive ? is marty still holding a grudge ? did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all ? i do n't know . overall , this movie was pretty dumb . the acting sucked , the music was okay , the story was pretty decent ( except for the ending ) . basically , this is just one of your average 80s teen slasher flicks . see it only for harry manfredini and caroline munro . 2/10<br /><br />P.S. - Simon Scuddamore ( Marty ) committed suicide shortly after the film 's release from intentional drug abuse . i guess he was the only person who knew this film was what it really was . A PILE OF SH * *
0 Slaughter High the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history . Unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell . A very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness . The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released . If you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember , choose life .
0 The school nerd Marty ( Simon Scuddamore ) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion ( set by them also ) where his face is scarred by acid . Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school ( since closed ) for a reunion . What they did n't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them . Then a storm starts , they 're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty silly . The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school -- but that 's about it . The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel ( he 's stripped , has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt ) and are just uncomfortable to watch . Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view . Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity . There is full frontal of Scuddamore ( surprising for any movie ) but one girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them ! And then there 's the couple that has to have sex . This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them . It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV ! The acting is bearable -- not good , but bearable . Caroline Munro is in this too . She 's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere . Otherwise it 's run of the mill and forgettable . Scuddamore 's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves .
0 Another FRIDAY THE 13TH ripoff , even featuring some of its music ! A group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la Jason Voorhees . Could it be that nerd they used to torment in school?<br /><br />Routine slash - fest is fun for fans of the genre , and contains the usual T&A quota for films if its ilk . The ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher.<br /><br />MPAA : Rated for violence / gore , language , sexuality , nudity , and some drug content .
0 For die - hard Judy Garland fans only . There are two ( 2 ) numbers that are really good -- one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady ( you 've all seen the pics ) , and a pretty good number at the very end . There are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny . But , basically , the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it 's hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout . But it 's worth the 2.50 to rent the movie -- just be prepared to fast - forward it .
0 This was filmed back - to - back with the 1992 re - make of Conan Doyle 's famous novel ' The Lost World ' . And it shows.<br /><br />The film starts promisingly enough , with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau , but then things go downhill . Everybody is stranded on the plateau and we 're left with a feeble , boring , over - length rehash of the first film.<br /><br />The dinosaurs ( who are hardly ever seen ) are just laughable . Are we expected to take that cuddly toy that 's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously ? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World . Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects , the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re - make .
0 Born Again is a sub - standard episode from season one . It deals with the subject of reincarnation and just does n't fly . I 've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode . It does reference the Tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode . But the positives end there . Which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode . I think it 's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl . And he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge . There 's even a serious lack of witty Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat . If you 're into reincarnation , maybe this episode is up your alley . If you 're not , then at least you can learn what bradycardia is .
0 Only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x - files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch . A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances . The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place . Mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge . Now for the bizarre bit . The little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation . I think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x - files history !
0 I 've now seen this film twice , and I must say I enjoyed it both times . It 's fast paced and fun , but ultimately daft . Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original . It is clear for those who have seen the awful ' Zombie Creeping Flesh ' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei , and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci . This is not idle Fulci sycophancy , the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout , and you can tell who directed what , particularly in Mattei 's case.<br /><br />The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus ( oddly referred to as ' top secret ' by a scientist , it 's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind ) somewhere in south east Asia . The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected , and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land . Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone , and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians.<br /><br />The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick , and an out and out action adventure , and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves . They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all . Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety , so well rendered in the original , and probably Fulci 's creation here . The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves , but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu : Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims . Martial arts skills are n't their only talents either , they are well versed in guerilla tactics , hiding on rafters and under bales of hay , and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves . This is all definitely the work of Mattei.<br /><br />There is a third , more chatty , variety of zombie . This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well ' I 'm really thirsty ... FOR YOUR BLOOD ' . The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind , only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution.<br /><br />Then there 's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air , a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face , as if to say ' yeah we know how bad this looks'.<br /><br />The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect . But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously . Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace . Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro , and one of the only effective scenes in the film.<br /><br />The guy who played the chief scientist has heart , but no talent , utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random , so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic . The scientists ' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing ' now lets put these two molecules together ! ' < br /><br />There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however . In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage . Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor , all shot in an atmospheric diffused light . The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her . His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film . The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak , and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance . There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead , and this is quite tense . Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs . But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been.<br /><br />All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest , rather than simply a through and through bad film . If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I 've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties .
0 I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorist 's body , infected with a stolen chemical , is recovered by the US military , the corpse is then cremated , releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island . Soon the infected locals turn into flesh - hungry zombies , and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead . I did not find this film to be as good as the original film , Zombie Flesh Eaters . But it was still an OK horror film with some good action . I did not think that it was one of the best in the series . 4/10
0 Next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s , ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub - genre . While slasher films had ' Black Christmas ' and ' Halloween ' to get the whole thing going , zombie flicks had George Romero 's ' Dead ' films . And unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series , other directors wanted to cash in . A lot of Italian directors were especially interested , such as Lucio Fulci who brought us ' Zombie ' a year after Romero 's ' Dawn of the Dead ' , known as ' Zombi ' in Italy and some other countries , and it was there that Fulci 's film was known as ' Zombi 2 ' . Apart from the walking dead it has no relation to Romero 's film , but is a good film in it 's own right . It was a big success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born.<br /><br />Pros : Lots of beautiful , lush scenery . Awesome score . The acting is n't exactly good , but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience . After kind of a slow start , the pace moves along like that of an action flick . Plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers . Good job on the make - up effects . Lots of blood and some decent gore.<br /><br />Cons : Virtually plot less . Nothing you have n't already seen before . Blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of ' Return of the Living Dead ' films . Cardboard characters . Has n't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music(Not that I 'm saying all rock music of that period is bad ) , clothing , and overall feel of the movie.<br /><br />Final thoughts : First of all , this is not a true sequel to Fulci 's cult classic . In fact , I do n't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off . For those that do n't know , Fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with Bruno Mattei . Mattei 's films are pretty laughable , but like this film many are good campy fun . And that 's all this film really is , just something to watch for fun.<br /><br />My rating : 3.5/5 ( So - bad - it's - good rating ) 2/5 ( Serious rating )
0 I am an avid fan of Lucio Fulci , and yet I must say that " Zombi 3 " ( aka . " Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 " ) of 1988 , which he made with two other directors , Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso , was quite a disappointment . Especially compared to its great predecessor , Fulci 's very own Gore classic " Zombi 2 " ( aka . " Zombie Felsh Eaters"/"Zombie " ) of 1979 , this is vastly disappointing . Sure , the low rating of 4.5 already suggests that it 's not a good film , but , these low ratings usually come from people who are not into Italian Zombie flicks , and as enthusiastic fan of Italian Horror films and low - budget Exploitation cinema , I love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings . Also , many of my fellow Italian Horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated , which I sadly can not agree with . Not that the film was a complete disaster . It has some redeeming qualities , above all Fulci 's nauseating gore effects , that are always a pleasure to watch for an Italian Horror / Gore buff . The basic idea behind the film is also not bad ( allthough far from original ) and I liked the ruthless portrayal of the military . Sadly , that 's about it . While the great predecessor " Zombi 2 " was extremely gory , but beyond that also genuinely creepy , this is not creepy or scary for a minute , and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch " Zombi 3 " . The film is sometimes fun to watch , but only for the gore , and as an unintentional comedy . I guess that it was mainly the gore that came from Fulci , and the disappointing rest that came from Mattei and Fragasso , the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cult - flicks ( such as D'Amato 's " Porno Holocaust " ) , and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made , the god - awful " Troll 2 " . Overall , this is definitely watchable for the gore , but , out of all Fulci films I 've seen so far , this is definitely the worst , and I 've seen the majority of this great filmmaker 's repertoire . I am a Fulci fan , and I always will be , but this sure is n't his magic moment . It may be fun for the gore , but I recommend to watch any other Fulci film before this !
0 Ohhh man ! Now this is what I 'm talking about ! As far as bad / cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own . A real gem!<br /><br />First off , the film was n't originally in English . That 's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional ! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog ( and there is plenty more where this came from )   " I 'm feeling a little better . I 'm just thirsty   FOR YOUR BLOOD!" < br /><br />And what drama ! Here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists  < br /><br />Scene 1   Scientist : " You ca n't do that   It 'll be a disaster ! " -- Military Officer : " That 's just science fiction " ( he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted).<br /><br />Scene 2   Scientist : " If you do that many people will die ! ! ! " -- Military Officer : " you do n't know what you 're talking about . " ( he does it and many people die).<br /><br />Scene 3   Scientist : " Do n't do that   It 'll kill everyone ! " -- Military Officer : " That 's nonsense " ( he then proceeds to kill everyone)<br /><br />Scene 4 , 5 , 6 , 7   ( you get the idea).<br /><br />If that was n't enough   there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics ! In one scene , the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men . The leader yells , " Go get ' em ! " and all 10 army guys , one at a time , drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries ! Instant classic!<br /><br />And do n't worry . No attention to detail was left out ! This movie even had a hip / upbeat ' 80 's keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood!<br /><br />And trust me   I realize this review might contain some spoilers , but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratched the surface . A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade ! A true movie watching experience ! A masterpiece ! Wow !
0 Although the likeliness of someone focusing on THIS comment among the other 80 + for this movie is low , I feel that I have to say something about this one . I am not the kind of movie - watcher who pays attention to production value , thought - provoking dialog , or brilliant acting & directing . However , I claim that this movie sucks . I do n't know why I do n't like it ... I mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie : blood , outrageousness , unintentional humor , etc . According to this evidence it should be my favorite . Still , Zombi 3 is a baaad movie.<br /><br />There are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen . Like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water ( this spoils nothing so do n't worry ) . She walks into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something . Did she not see that there was a friggin ' lake in the middle of the building ? ? ? Yes she 's looking for water and passes up a lake . Why ? Cuz she wants to know why the people ( who are n't there cuz the place is abandoned ) wo n't answer her when she calls out : " Is anybody there ? " Oh this is just a little , insignificant piece of the big picture I 'm painting.<br /><br />There is a reason , though , why I gave this film more than 1 star . It 's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is , like I have a few times , you 'll want to watch it again because it 's just so over - the - top in every aspect . I called it blood in the first paragraph , but this movie has no blood , it has an ocean of gore . Also , it has pretty weird creatures in it as well : a zombie - baby ( with an adult - size hand ? ? ? ) and a magically flying head to name just two.<br /><br />You know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with ' 50 's sci - fi movies ? I believe that Zombi 3 and movies like it should top those . It has all the elements : scientists arguing with the government , warnings of the apocalypse on the radio , armies battling monsters , and so on . This IS the Plan 9 of the ' 80 's ! While I wo n't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it , just expect the very worst . And when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating Zombi 3 , it wo n't be all that bad . You might actually like it , I 'm not saying that 's impossible.<br /><br />Don't think I hate this movie , I do n't ... really . Oh , P.S. Killing Birds ( aka Zombie 5 ) rules ! ( did I just blow my credibility ? )
0 First off I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci . This film was utter trash . I could n't stand to watch it . The storyline was a joke , the acting was a joke , and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke.<br /><br />We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE . Whatever , this movie is n't worth the $ 1.00 it cost to rent it . I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible . If Zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be I think I will just skip them.<br /><br />Zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho .
0 The dubbing / translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick . I have n't laughed so hard in my life as I just did watching Zombi 3 ( and I 've seen some really bad dubbing in my life , believe me ) . Seriously , the filmmakers could re - edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars . It 's just that funny.<br /><br />But ... If falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a Fulci zombie movie is n't your cup of tea , then AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS .
0 Where do I begin ? I wanted to enjoy this movie , and I did . Still , I wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another zombie film that was worth my loot , and it was nt . This was a different kind of enjoyment . This was unhealthy , a perverse glee that I partook in watching one of the most ridiculous films I d seen yet . And I do nt much care for whatever Fulci 's excuses were , there was no excuse for this film going how it went . This was a bad film all the way around , yet I still ca nt give it below a 4 out of ten , which is what I gave it , because well ... at least I was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie.<br /><br />I had to imagine these zombies , that were all over the ceilings of these buildings everywhere ... had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they crawled up on the beems , and perched themselves high on stone erections , or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerk - offs coming around , so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambushes . Hell , what else is there to do when you re dead?<br /><br />I had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings , kicks , and jumps , and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers . I feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained . I watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in , the Phillipenes , was absolutely engulfed in fog , heavy doses of fog , and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats . I had to even cringe when I saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle , with " Dead One " written in the middle . I had to ask myself ... if the science of curing zombies is that easy , then I wonder if I could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here!<br /><br />All in all the effects were overboard , the dubbing horrid , I m sure the original acting as poor , the story absurd , the zombies inconsistent , even in a bad way they could ve all been similar , and the women ugly , but I found myself enjoying this thing . It was a fun watch . It turned out to be a very very bad film , and I would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films , but still , again I say ... it was worth a good laugh . I crave zombie films no matter what , but when this had Fulci 's name attached to it , it should ve been much better . Let me dare say , Zombie Holocaust was better .
0 When i finally had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3(Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe)on an import Region 2 Japanese dvd , i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is . The transfer is just about immaculate , as good as it 's ever going to look unless Anchor Bay gets a hold of it . The gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx . The sound is also terrific . It 's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2,you can really appreciate the cheesy music(actually a very good score),and the effective although cheap sound effects . It never sounded so good , and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I never realized just how much blood flows in this film , it 's extremely brutal with exploding head shots , exploding puss filled mega pimples , a cleaver to a zombies throat , a woman 's burned off extremities(how come it did'nt burn the guy also),intestinal munching , zombie babies and so much more i lost track.<br /><br />This is no doubt for hardcore Zombie action fans , especially of the Italian kind . There is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found , i think people do n't give it enough credit , if you see a clean print , and not some horrendous pirate copy , it 's a whole other experience entirely.<br /><br />This film never lets up for a second , and i realize it 's inconsistent plotwise , the dubbing is horrible , the acting is stiff , and it 's sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion , but that 's part of it 's charm.<br /><br />To me this is one of the best horror films ever made , you ca n't make a film this bad , so good , on purpose . It 's accidental genius of the highest order . If they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster , but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it 's nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards.<br /><br />Tons of action sequences , exotic locales , excellent set design , good , sometimes great cinematography , wonderfully cheesy acting , and inconsistent but still interesting plot , great makeup effects , beautiful women who can kick butt , excellent music , and sometimes hilarious , sometimes creepy , but always entertaining zombies . How can you go wrong with this film , it has it all , a cult classic that stands the test of time .
0 I admit that the majority of this film was uninspired , but i was still entertained . It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy , above average music , and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves , there 's no prissies here . I can think of dozens of other films that were way worse , at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary . They allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics , destroy everything in sight , even if it means the people you 're supposed to be saving . Also , how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist . Fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work(zombie , beyond , gates of hell)in an effort to somehow improve on them . He failed , but definitely not miserably , like a number of people would have you think . I have a soft spot for zombie films , so i admit that i 'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them . All i 'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around , if there was n't so much descension in the making of this film(fulci quit and bruno(i can hack with the best of them)mattei took over)it could have been much better and more focused . It 's going to stay in my collection as fulci 's zombie swan song . One surprising note , is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off , i could n't believe it myself , check it out you 'll be surprised .
0 Zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead , while trying to escape the man is shot at & the metal container holding the chemical is breached . The man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie . Within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims , Kenny ( Deran Sarafian ) & his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help Patricia ( Beatrice Ring ) & her friend Lia ( Deborah Bergammi ) who has been pecked by zombie birds ( ! ) . General Morton is in charge of the situation & has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world ! But will he & his men succeed?<br /><br />This Italian produced film was to be directed by Italian zombie gore film auteur Lucio Fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke & therefore could n't finish the film so producer Franco Gaudenzi asked second unit director Bruno Mattei & writer Claudio Fragasso to step in & complete the film . Apparently Mattei & Fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded a lot of the footage Fulci shot & added a lot of their own & Zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 50/50 split . The script by Fragasso is an absolute mess , none of it is well thought out & is just as stupid as it gets . The scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd . The zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever , look at the scene where Patricia is on the bridge & the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it 's on steroids , then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft . There are so many things wrong with Zombi 3 , scene after scene of terribly thought out & ineptly directed action , awful character 's & really dull broken English dialogue which does n't make sense half the time . Then there 's the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air & bite someones neck , the scene when the guy 's in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill Kenny & Roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try & kill them by hand , even when Kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles & when Kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles & it 's one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film & then there 's the end where Kenny takes off in the helicopter but ca n't rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up & then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass , what ? Since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass ? This all may sound ' fun ' but believe me it 's not , it 's a really bad film that is just boring , repetitive & simply does n't work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs.<br /><br />It 's hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot . It has a bland lifeless feel about it & for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist , the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine & you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine & thinning out as it disperses across the scene . Since a lot of it is set during the day it does n't add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever & when they do get it right & the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day ! The direction is poor with no consistency & it just looks & feels bottom of the barrel stuff . Even the blood & gore is n't up to much , there 's a gory hand severing at the start , a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman 's stomach , a legless woman ( what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way & why did n't it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her ? ) & a few OK looking zombies is as gory as it gets . For anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which Fulci regularly served up during the late 70 's & early 80 's will be very disappointed , there are n't any decent feeding scenes , no intestines , no stand out ' head shots ' & very little gore at all.<br /><br />Technically the film is poor , the special effects are cheap looking , the cinematography is dull , the music is terrible , the locations are bland & it has rock bottom production values . This was actually shot in the Philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum . The entire film is obviously dubbed , the acting still looks awful though & the English version seems to have been written by someone who does n't understand the language that well.<br /><br />Zombi 3 is not a sequel to Fulci 's classic zombie gore fest Zombi 2 ( 1979 ) , it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash - in title . I 'm sorry but Zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film , it 's boring , it makes no sense , it 's not funny enough to be entertaining & it lacks any decent gore . One to avoid .
0 Zombie Review # 3<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />Few films are actually " so bad they 're good " , and Zombi 3 is not just bad , it 's wretchedly , unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them all < br /><br />More than that , it 's a film credited to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency , sense or reason . However we ca n't blame Fulci as it was n't really directed by him but by Bruno Mattei , who does n't even have Fulci 's sense of style to help carry the film . Mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude.<br /><br />So , I 'm ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3 . It has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin characters , weak story , and lack of film making skill , Zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it 's even funnier than Nightmare City.<br /><br />The " action " starts when the " Death 1 " gas is stolen from a military base , and damaged in the escape . Who is the thief , why did he steal it , and why did the US military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea ? All these questions and more will fail to be answered in Zombi 3 .... <br /><br />After hiding out at a hotel , the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it , sending " Death 1 " up into the atmosphere resulting in ... zombie birds ! Who then attack people and turn them into zombie people ! ! ! ( if zombies are cannibals , why do n't the zombie birds just attack other birds?)<br /><br />Then we meet our " heroes " , a trio of horny GIs and a coachload of girls . There 's a couple of other guys with them too , but they 're not important - NO ONE is important here . You 'll be hard pressed to remember anyone 's face , let alone their name or find a reason to care about them . They end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief ( " a week ago this place was buzzing with life , now it 's buzzing with flies ! " ) but there 's no escape from the undead.<br /><br />By this point you 'll either be completely sucked in or you 'll have turned the damned thing off . The script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world could n't save it , so it 's just as well they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters , the zombie acting here is an all time low . There 's no consistancy in how the zombies behave - some shamble about in the time honored style , others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes , not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk ( a gimmick that gives the film it 's HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING ) . They die from gunshots to the chest ( rather than the head ) and even get knocked out by a good left - hook . How can you punch out a zombie ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! In fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of V ... <br /><br />The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding , seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life . They hide in bushes , in garages , in huts , on roofs , in the water , and even underneath pregnant women . At one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs . To kill and eat her ? No ! To push her into the water , those zombies and their wacky sense of humour!<br /><br />There is plenty of gore though . Limbs are hacked , wounds ooze green pus , and there 's much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in . There 's nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing , but if bad make up effects are your bag you wo n't be let down.<br /><br />All this and I 've not even mentioned the awful music , the inexplicable flying zombie head , the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as REALLY bad , or the final chilling punchline .... in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies , Zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie DJ ! ! " He 's gone over to their side ! " our escaping hero 's cry , before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came.<br /><br />Zombi 3 is rubbish - it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it 's existence erased , yet somehow I feel my life is richer for having seen it.<br /><br />Did I say richer ? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
0 This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard - to - find gem . It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like " SPASMO " and " BEYOND THE DARKNESS " . Unfortunately , the previews were the best thing about this movie.<br /><br />"ZOMBI 3 " in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous Lucio Fulci " ZOMBIE " franchise which began in 1979 . Similarly compared to " ZOMBIE " , " ZOMBI 3 " consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this ' horror ' trash barely afloat . The gore is nearly non - existent ( unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces ) and the English dubbing is a notch below embarrassing.<br /><br />The plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ( ie . an idiotic male and his stupid female side - kick ) who are developing some sort of chemical called " Death One " that is supposed to re - animate the dead . Unless my ears need to be checked , I do n't even recall a REASON for the research of " Death One " . It seems to EXIST only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to ' star ' in this cinematic laugh - fest.<br /><br />Anyway , " Death One " is experimented on a corpse ( whom I swear looked like Yul Brynner ) , and after it is injected into his system , he sits upright and his head explodes ! The sound effects are also quite hilarious - as the corpse 's face bubbles with green slime , the sound of ' paper crumpling ' can be heard . The " Death One " toxin is transported outside and is ' hi - jacked ' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it , but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial.<br /><br />Needless to say , the guy turns into a zombie , but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel , infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror ( ! ) . The military catch wind of this and immediately take action before ' eliminating ' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the ' contamination zone ' and turn the motel upside down . They find the infected thief and burn his body , only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack(!).<br /><br />We cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army , listening to ' groovy music ' that is coming out of a little dinky boom - box while trailing a trailer - load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests . Can someone say " zombie food " ? We also have a sub - plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that were infected by the ' zombie ' smoke ! < br /><br />The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water . This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie . She walks around this old dirty , rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud , " HELLO ? IS THERE ANYONE HERE ? PLEASE , I JUST NEED SOME WATER ! " She encounters a group of zombies , one of which is chained to a wall ( ! ) and the other is swinging a machete . After a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground , she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter.<br /><br />Meanwhile , the birds attack the trailer - load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected . They all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place , and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place . After a matter of hours ( a day at the most ) , the same motel is now caked in dust , has vines growing throughout it , and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years . Anyway , what better place to take refuge than this particular building ? Needless to say , the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack.<br /><br />The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village , of which the woman comments , " THIS PLACE IS A DUMP ! " She then proceeds to get ' pushed ' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna ( ? ) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds ! Meanwhile , her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected HOURS earlier is still TURNING into a zombie!<br /><br />Unfortunately , there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words . For example , the time rate concerning infected people being ' zombified ' differs greatly . Sometimes it takes seconds , other times it takes hours . Some zombies run , others drag their feet and walk really slow . Some even do kung - fu moves , while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people . Some of the zombies even talk ! The funniest moment of course is the infamous ' zombie head in the fridge ' gag which ' elevates ' itself in mid - air and ' attacks ' a stupid man who goes looking for food . Funnily enough , his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it 's ' headless ' counter - part ( LMAO!).<br /><br />The biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story - lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies . We never get to see them come back as zombies , in fact the only ones we do see ' zombified ' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off . Other than that , I was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and/or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies . It is also amazing that these zombies only take a ' few bites ' and then move on to their next victim . < br /><br />The most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus . A pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital . A woman who seems to have a lot of ' medical knowledge ' tries to deliver the baby ( ! ) and has her face pulled off by a zombie , before having her head pushed into the woman 's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off . Timeless!<br /><br />As usual , all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre . The megalomaniacal military officer , the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed , the obvious characters who are ABOUT to get killed ( ie . watch for the man chasing a chicken ! ) I guess this movie really is a comedy . There were many laughable scenes , such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade ( obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent ) and a climatic scene where a man screams , " I'M THIRSTY .... THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD ! " . The costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film , wearing the same ' Asian - like ' clothing that may be found in a Bruce Lee film , and watch out for the blue 60 's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man.<br /><br />The end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story - line . A radio DJ who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the ' beginning of the end ' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter . Hardly " DAWN OF THE DEAD " material if you ask me.<br /><br />Regardless , this movie does deliver many laughs . The gore is minimal , and what gore there is , it is very unconvincing , let alone unimaginative . The usual mix of black blood , thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and ' zombie make - up ' consisting of green moss . " ZOMBI 3 " makes for a good rental for a sleep - over party or a night of beer and popcorn . Other than that , horror fans should stay away.<br /><br />3 out of 10
0 In 1979 Lucio Fulci released his film Zombi . However , due to the earlier import of George Romero 's Dawn of the Dead , which had gone by that name for its Italian release , it was retitled to Zombi 2 . ( Which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second Romero movie ) . Continuing this theme , the second Zombi film , which would have been called Zombi 2 , was then consequently titled Zombi 3 . In the UK , the original Zombi film ( that is , Zombi 2 ) was titled " Zombie Flesh Eaters " . To continue THIS theme , the second Zombi film ( Zombi 3 ) was then titled " Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 " for its UK release . ( Are you following all this ? ) So if Zombie Flesh Eaters was Fulci 's Dawn , then is 2 his Day of the Dead ? While this is only a flippant observation , this tale of military compounds , helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance.<br /><br />Some of Fulci 's European direction compels in a film like this , but the acting , dubbing and exposition - heavy script are absolutely horrendous . Its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext , while there 's an ( unintentionally ) hilarious Birds homage . Combining this last element with MOR 80s rock is not a good idea . For some reason I could n't stop thinking of Time of the Apes ( q.v . ) the whole time I was watching this . This is obviously not a good thing.<br /><br />While there 's nothing here to rival topless scuba - diving , shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter , Fulci 's misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaner 's mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood . His fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing . Both themes are combined when a woman 's face is ripped off , first by one zombie , then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant woman 's stomach.<br /><br />Production - wise , this is obviously a step up from Zombi , coming five years later . ( Nine years in worldwide release terms ) . But without the original 's low - key charm it struggles , while Stefano Mainetti 's music is inappropriate and uninspired . Fabio Frizzi 's score was one of the best things about the ' 79 movie . Here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like Bonnie Tyler 's " Holding Out For A Hero " . In the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest , and Roger and Kenny , two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious . ( " We 're out of ammunition " to a stalling gun is a particular standout ) . But where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves . Low key or not , Fulci 's original had truly magnificent , rotting zombies . Skull faces , worms in eye sockets ... they really were something to behold . By contrast , this dull follow - up opts for the more traditional " men with a bit of paint on their faces " option . < br /><br />The climax rips off too many Romero movies to even be funny , while the use of the DJ is a crass and cheap narrative device . Not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first , this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal . < br /><br />It turns out that Fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes , the rest filmed by Bruno Mattei . I 'm fairly sure that even Fulci would have balked at the ludicrous " flying zombie head " scene , and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave . Unfortunately , however , it 's his name that 's above the film title on releases , so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a Fulci film through and through . On that scale then it 's a major setback for him , for this movie commits what you imagine Fulci would regard as the worst crime of all : that of being boring .
0 " Gone With The Wind " is one of the most overrated movies in history . It is a film loved by mothers , grandmothers , and shut - ins who go to the movies once every five years . As a zombie movie , it blows . There is n't a shambling corpse in sight , and it 's terribly light in the gore department . " Zombie 3 " , on the other hand , is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood - spilling -- therefore , it is better than " Gone With the Wind " . It is also not overrated . Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish . It is , however , not boring rubbish . After a terrorist steals a virus , he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter , and the chemicals leak into the ground . The terrorist , who has been exposed to the nasty concoction , hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh - eating zombie . One of his first victim 's is a cleaning lady . Once she 's bitten , Lucio Fulci 's brand of hell breaks loose . As usual for a Fulci flick , the acting is atrocious , the storyline is riddled with plot holes , and the gore is plentiful . Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei , so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature . It is badly shot , too , poorly edited , and the sound design is flat . Still , it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing . Definitely worth picking up if you 're an undead completest . Or do n't like " Gone With The Wind " , undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time .
0 I 'm a big fan of horror flicks , and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine . That said , Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen . So needless to say I really enjoyed it , it 's the best bad movie I 've seen in a long while . The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon 's " Return of the Living Dead " , but whereas that film was intentionally funny , this one is the opposite . It has some of the most laughable acting I 've ever witnessed , especially from the main scientist character . His scenes with the General were just hysterical . Also , the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy , and the death scenes are often just downright stupid . This , of course , makes it all the more fun . POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head , which then opens its eyes and somehow FLIES OUT OF THE FRIDGE ( obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string ) , latching onto the guys neck , killing him . Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now ? It defies every law of physics known to man , and it 's one of the most absurd things ever filmed . That 's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess . I ca n't believe it 's gotten so high a rating here . If you are a fan of bad movies , do yourself a favor and rent this sucker .
0 Title : Zombie 3 ( 1988 ) < br /><br />Directors : Mostly Lucio Fulci , but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei < br /><br />Cast : Ottaviano DellAcqua , Massimo Vani , Beatrice Ring , Deran Serafin < br /><br />Review : < br /><br />To review this flick and get some good background of it , I got ta start by the beginning . And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead . When Dawn came out in 79 , Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2 . That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie . You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark ! OK so , after that flick ( named Zombie 2 in Italy ) came out and made a huge chunk of cash , the Italians decided , heck . Lets make some more zombie flicks ! These things are raking in the dough ! So Zombie 3 was born . Confused yet ? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we 've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one , the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead . Lets see ... there 's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies . Canister gets released into the general population and shebang ! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh . A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel . They got ta fight the zombies to survive.<br /><br />There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie . First and foremost , Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick . So he could n't really finish this film the way that he wanted to . The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei ( Hell of the Living Dead ) and Claudio Fragasso ( Zombie 4 ) . They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good . You see Fulci himself did n't really have his heart and soul on this flick . He was disenchanted with it . He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said : " Do whatever the hell you want with it ! " And god love them , they did.<br /><br />And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its " director " . The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore ! There 's no substance to it whatsoever ! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it , the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies . Now in some cases this can prove to be fun , if # 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and # 2 there 's a lot of gore and guts involved.<br /><br />Here we get neither ! Well there 's some inspired moments in there , like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people . That was cool . There 's also a scene involving a flying zombie head ( wich by the way defies all logic and explanation ) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs . But aside from that ... the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.<br /><br />Endless upon endless scenes that do n't do jack to move the already non existent plot along . That was my main gripe with this flick . The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non - existent . I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished ! I like my b - movies , but this one just really went even below that ! Its closer to a z - level flick , if you ask me.<br /><br />The zombie make up ? Pure crap . The zombies are all Asian actors ( the movie was filmed in the Philippines ) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies . But that s not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway . Its the look of the zombies that really sucks ! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason . And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up ( more like smudges ) on their faces . One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up , but it still was n't good enough to impress . Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces . So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap . These are supposed to be dead folks ! Anyhows , for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick do n't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else 's flick . And those two involved ( Mattei and Fragasso ) did n't really put there heart and souls into it . In fact , when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick , he does n't even take it to seriously . You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they " just had a job to do and they did it " . And that my friends , is the last nail on this flick . There 's no love , and no heart put into making this film . Therefore you get a half assed , crappy zombie flick.<br /><br />Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made . Everybody else , do n't even bother ! Rating : 1 out of 5
0 Miraculously , this is actually quite watchable . I mean , it 's bad . It 's really bad . But whereas the original was so - bad - it's - ruining - my - life bad , this is so - bad - it's - mildly - entertaining bad . Right , that 's enough faint praise . Production values are rotten across the board , the acting is excruciating and the Romero - wannabe satire ca n't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it 's mocking . Internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges , virus incubation times fluctuating as the ' plot ' requires , bullets working against the zombies or not , zombies having the power of speech or not . Gore is the draw , obviously , but the framework is so slapdash it 's annoying . The dialogue sounds like it 's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals , and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of Romero 's films . It 's all topped off with a horrendous synth score . Absolute rubbish .
0 I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement . On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel . Unfortunately the more I watched it the more I realised how well made Danny Boyle 's original was and how much this movie influenced 28 WEEKS LATER < br /><br />One ca n't help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of Italian horror movie . I was totally convinced ZOMBI 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest - In which case I would have called my summary 28 YEARS LATER ( Geddit ? ) - but was n't until I came to this page to find it was released in 1988 . All the production values scream that it 's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade . I might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now < br /><br />Much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity . For example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a DJ . Likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they 've had their head chopped off , wait till you see the fridge scene , you might just die laughing . Even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he 's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career < br /><br />Obviously you 're reminded of the earlier film THE CRAZIES which also reminded me of the later 28 films . Bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you 'll have worked out that basically everyone dies . The problem with this is you 'll instantly be reminded of how the British franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget . Not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie . ZOMBI 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience
0 I 'm a nice guy , and I like to think of myself as genre - tolerant . And , I guess by that , I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in . If nothing else , that saves me from feeling like I should be saying really nasty things about people or films , which I do n't like doing.<br /><br />The plot in this one was patently obvious , the production values very low and sets , uhm , simplistic . The acting rose into " good for a high school play " territory from time to time . My feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was.<br /><br />Worst of all , the sex , while reasonably plentiful , was fairly mundane , hampered by , at least in my copy , a " sound - over " that was inconsistent with the action ( climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra ? ? ? ) . There was definitely no " edge " to it at all -- nothing distinguishing or interesting , and with surprisingly quick cuts.<br /><br />My vote is a " 1 " then , with the following summary statement : would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded , and the rest of the movie condensed .
0 I have two very major complaints regarding this film.<br /><br />1 . That my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the " suspense " category . ( Had I known what it was , I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place . And yes , this movie is a soft core porn.)<br /><br />2 . The title has nothing to do with the movie . No one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive , let alone a combination of the two.<br /><br />Actually , make that three major complaints:<br /><br />3 . That I for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list . Boy do I regret that . Stay away from this movie . Learn from my mistake . This movie is valueless on virtually every level .
0 My teacher taped this and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people . It just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny , unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and could n't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such . I would n't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script . Stacy 's ( the carrier of the baby ) mother is a riot . She is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window . Bobby 's ( the father ) best friend 's name is Dewey , and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn 's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High . This movie is horrid , simply because none of the characters are believable . Thank goodness it 's only made for TV , limiting the public 's chances of viewing it .
0 Batman Mystery of the Batwoman , is , in a word , stale . < br /><br />The plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante ( " Batwoman " ) is intruding on Batman 's turf , and while Batman is trying to combat a Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne threesome , he 's trying to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is . < br /><br />There is nothing strikingly wrong about this , but there is nothing really special about it either , noting really made it stick out . < br /><br />Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce 's long lost love re surface and mess with his head.<br /><br />Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr Freeze . < br /><br />Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off , Return of the Joker , dug deep with the characters involved . < br /><br />But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots , a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat . Frankly , this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight , lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in it 's prime .
0 I am a back Batman movie and TV fan . I loved the show ( new and old ) and I loved all the movies . But this movie is not as great as some people were hopeing it to be . In my opinon , it is a big let down . I think the problem was it had no drama . Batman : Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond : Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama . and Batman & Mr. Freeze : Sub Zero had some drama too . Also , I think this movie is to light for Batman . The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end . Anyways , it 's an ok Batman movie . But I would just rent it .
0 The story is very trustworthy and powerful . The technical side of the movie is quite fine .. even the directing of it . The main problem is with the castings , that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression . Beside the small role of the father , Rafael ( played impressively by Asi Dayan ) , all other actors were unfortunately not in their best . The role of the elder Blind girl , played by Taly Sharon , was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role . therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile . There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie . But after all it 's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future .
0 Ignoring ( if possible ) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking ( which seems to be mandatory in Australian government - funded films ) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance . That 's a far as it goes . The rest is simply awful . The plot 's overburdened with " wow " symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere . A gross example is the giant peach float , obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory . It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free , but nevertheless irrelevant , prop ! The peach is given a cursory , unexplained wash - down at one stage but that 's where it ends.<br /><br />Similarly , the contrived " black spot " road sign where Steph 's parents were killed , is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past , but her escape to what ? She 's had a pretty good deal where she was , especially considering her visual disability and the unending , loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.<br /><br />The Guinness ' prize for corny melodrama , however , goes to the characterization of Alan . Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but " rats " on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi - national - hiss ! hiss ! As a supervisor , Alan performs the boss ' villainous dirty work . He implements redundancies until , surprise , surprise , the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic , unemployed failure . No cliché - free zones here , mate ! Not only this , but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you 'd encounter . If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic , do n't ask about detail . What 's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph 's seductive leg ? Why does n't the hotel , where the couple makes love , eventually twig that someone 's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and , among other pandemoniums , the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion . Summing this movie up in one word : Avoid , Avoid , Avoid .
0 Yet again one of the most misunderstood Goddesses of my country has been twisted by " Westerners " who can not understand the esoteric symbolism of the Mother Goddess in her dark forms . The Mother takes on the frightening form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner demons , and to terrify our egos . And though blood sacrifice is given to Kali and Durga , the events depicted in this film are just absurd . The Mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons , limitations , and ego when no other form will suffice . It 's also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your Karmas in the " Smashan " fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her , and she will bring you to reality and truth . Reality and truth has a dark side as well as light , which serves a purpose . The Mother is the embodiment of the physical Universe as well , she is Nature . Nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance . You can not have growth and life without death and destruction . Kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe . It 's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of India or it 's divinity can just take one of our beloved Goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low - budget , talentless horror film . How dare they take our beloved Mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off ! ? She is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion , greed , anger , and other inner - demons . It 's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self - deluding ego , and serious inner - demons to see Kali as so horrible and terrible . When the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting , beautiful , and young , a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire Universe with it . Kali Maa is an ancient Mother , not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment , let 's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie.<br /><br />The audacity that Westerners have in using religions like my own , or the religions of the Caribbean Islands such as Santeria , and Vodou which are actually very positive , and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the Western mind can not comprehend , is totally ridiculous . It 's clear that there is no respect for what people live , breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks.<br /><br />Kali Maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother , whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for . And I am happy that my Mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces.<br /><br />Many Praises to the REAL Kali Maa , who has shown MANY the path of God and realization .
0 I ca n't understand all the hype about this movie . OK , if you like cheap splatter , you will love this movie , but if you like good stories and good actors - do n't watch this . Personally i really disliked the actors in this movie , they seem to be hired straight from the street . The Dialogs are completely flat and you always know what 's coming up next . The overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget . When we saw this movie ( me and 3 other people ) we all had in mind , that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this , just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort . Another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam ( very shaking ) and the bad sound , the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone .
0 This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to watch it for a college class about India , however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it does n't really contain much cold , hard information on those details . It is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together . The gore factor is superb , however . Even right at the very beginning , you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense . Only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore , because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it . I 've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events , however you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch .
0 Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks , but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... I know it is low budget , but anyway : the actors behave like playing in a soap , the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago . I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies , but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished . But at least one good thing : the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to . The DVD cover promised a lot , but that is by far the best this film has to offer ...
0 Ever since I started visiting this site , and voting for movies , I have never given any movie a rating of 1 . Even the disturbing " Dance ! Workout with Barbie " got a 2 . There is a reason for this.<br /><br />Any time I find myself watching what I think is a really bad movie , I have to stop and ask myself the following question : " Is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul - sucking beast that is ' Theodore Rex ' ? " And I 've never been able to answer " yes".<br /><br />I would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said " Hey ! Let 's remake ' Blade Runner ' with Barney in the Harrison Ford Role ! " and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film . Furthermore , I want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it had n't gone strait to video . This is that rare monster : a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults . I 'd ask " what were they THINKING ? " but in this case , it might actually be redundant.<br /><br />Anyhow , all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you 're one of the five or six rabid fans of " Howard the Duck " , or if you are curious to see the most Evil Insane movie of all time , or you want to REALLY punish yourself .
0 Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining . So can Whoopi Goldberg movies . But Whoopi AND dinosaurs?<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes of " Theodore Rex " , I had come to one conclusion : this movie is evil . Evil , vile , wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience . Nothing this bad is made by accident ; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber.<br /><br />First of all , Whoopi does not make good action movies ( watch " Fatal Beauty " if you think I 'm lying ) , but the film makers do n't care - she 's a tough cop here , yet again . < br /><br />Seen a million cop buddy flicks this week ? Well , here 's number one million and one , pal.<br /><br />Don't like cute , humanistic animated dinosaurs since that Spielberg TV show about them ? Too bad , here 's another one and he 's a cop , too!<br /><br />You one of those people that hates car chases , shoot - outs , sloppy dialogue , boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people ( Goldberg , Mueller - Stahl , Roundtree ) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write - off ? A BIG tax write - off?<br /><br />And you read this review all the way to the end . You DESERVE a sequel . Seriously.<br /><br />No stars , not a one . And if they really make a sequel to " Theodore Rex " , Hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise - cracking foam rubber dinosaurs.<br /><br />Now , I 'd pay to see that .
0 I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at Wal - Mart earlier in the week . All three children actually got physically ill while watching it . I 'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate , or something they all had picked up from school , but really it could have been this film . Absolutely disgusting . How any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me . Fortunately , I turned off the film when I noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely . For any parents out there , I strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie .
0 This is , without a doubt , the single worst movie ever created . There 's no arguing here . This is it . End of story . The story is juvenile and sub - moronic , looking like it was created by a three - year - old fascinated with dinosaurs . The entire concept is just plain dumb . It 's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining . The jokes are also completely lame . If you have n't seen this movie yet , consider yourself lucky . If your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is , please do n't make me describe it . Words ca n't express how completely awful this movie is . This is n't just bad as in being a bad movie . Even those have cohesion , if not entertainment value . This . . . This is . . . Ugh ! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000 , and you still have n't come close to how awful this movie is . After giving Pokemon the Movie one point , giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity . That 's how bad it is . Did the producers and directors even take film classes ? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film . It looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film . If you rented this , please take it back and ask for a refund . And do n't even think about renting it again .
0 No matter what anyone tells you , there is a mere fact to the word " possession " in film circles -- such as " what possessed you to greenlight this film ? " Religion does n't have anything to do with it , but common sense does . That is , if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment.<br /><br />On many levels I tried to rationalize where this film would entertain .... or even interest the average consumer . The star ? The story ? The unique idea ? A buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman ? On , my goodness ! I am sure when this was an " idea " , it sounded good . But somewhere during the course of development ... someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for ... unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see.<br /><br />Regardless , this is a complete mess . Mess , mess - sin and a mess.<br /><br />Who cares about the plot ( what plot ? ) et al . Whoopie got a paycheck , but I would have been embarrassed to take it . I sure hope she fired her agent / manager / publicist over this career move . Obviously not , she went on to make more bad films . And more bad films . Sad .
0 This movie was astonishing . It is beyond atrocious . I often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value . My friend suggested this one , but as we watched it , people began to leave . I really wanted to finish it , just so that I could say that I had , but I was unable to . It 's that bad . Horrible running gags , lame acting . The main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg . I would rather watch Costener 's The Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again . I think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues , but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail , and then guffawing about it . It hurts . Watch it if you 're an aspiring masochist , otherwise , leave this one alone .
0 What a mess ! ! Why was this movie made ? This , and other movies of its " caliber " should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie . Children may like it , but anyone over 10 may or will disapprove . To make matters worse was the fact that such great talent like Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were entirely wasted in a film unworthy of any notice .
0 From the What Was She Thinking ? file : Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur ( ! ) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice - age . Straight - to - tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous , a high - concept in search of itself . Apparently this was a labor of love for its writer - director , Jonathan Betuel ( who also served as one of the producers ) ; sadly , the end results are anemic , to be charitable . Goldberg 's mere presence on - screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script , but here she 's drowning and you can see the unfunny results . NO STARS from * * * *
0 Poor Whoopi Goldberg . Imagine her at a friend 's dinner party , and she adds a comment to the in - depth political discussion going on . People just look at her and say , " Oh what would YOU know , you were the star of ' Theodore Rex ' " . How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap ? Even little kids would be cringing in horror at this Thing . It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of ' Sigmund And The Sea Monsters ' . Actually , come to think of it , ' Sigmund ' was vastly superior to this.<br /><br />And however did it get made ? By plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it ? Watch this hideous abomination at your own peril .
0 I watch LOTS of bad films , LOTS ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's kind of a hobby , really . Almost every Saturday nite a group of friends and I get together and watch trash from around the globe - ANYTHING . Turkish super hero movies , vampire flicks from Brazil , Italian gorilla transplant movies , Kevin Costner films , ANYTHING ( except maybe Raising Helen ) but Ihave never seen a WORST film than THEODORE REX . Never . And it 's not even entertainingly bad in an Ed Wood kinda way - it just SUCKS . Now this film was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she HATED THIS PIECE OF CRAP = she tried to get out of her contract , she whined , she moaned but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see , yikes ! ! ! ! And you can just see her seething during takes - doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him . The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible a third grade class could do a better job if promised cookies .
0 These reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one . This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6 , Battlefield Earth and Gigli had . Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful . I have n't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies . Before I start the review let me tell you the story . Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters . They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight - to - video movie in decades . Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.<br /><br />Plot : a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age . A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.<br /><br />The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery . Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful . Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail . Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen . Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose ) . I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex : the worst movie of Whoopi 's career.<br /><br />Don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable . I did n't see that when I watched this movie . All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck . The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney . Utterly painful from start to finish .
0 From watching only the trailer to Theodore Rex , you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume . That is true , but this is mostly a futuristic story , which looks a lot like Batman Forever with it 's direction style and weird character designs . It was mismarketed , and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale , instead of just a lame cop comedy . Whether or not this movie is mismarketed , it 's still a horrible movie.<br /><br />In the future , dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology , and they talk and walk around like humans . Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously , but after a dinosaur is murdered , he 's given the case to work on , but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all , Katie Coltrane ( Whoopi Goldberg ) . It 's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder , and it 's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud.<br /><br />Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character , but by the end he is unbearable to listen to . For some reason along with being a detective , he 's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator . He does imitations of famous people and accents , and has some truly awful lines . Whoopi blames him for farting and he says , " It 's not my butt trumpet ! " Wow ! What a puerile , immature line , even for a kid 's movie of this caliber . Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone . I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film.<br /><br />This movie never knew what it wanted to be . When the futuristic scenes and action occur , there is no comedy or humor . In any non - action scenes , the characters try to be as funny as they can , which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome . The action scenes do n't work as they 're too weird and not violent enough , and as stated earlier , the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes . Nothing ever works here.<br /><br />Having a dinosaur / human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie , if nothing else . Nope ! This movie is a huge rip - off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit . Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons , and set it in the future , and it 's the exact same plot . A man is killed , a dinosaur is killed . A dinosaur and detective solve the murder , a toon and detective solve the murder . The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels . The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels . The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs . This is a huge rip - off of a much better movie!<br /><br />Overall , this is a bad movie , not even deserving of it 's straight to VHS stature.<br /><br />My rating : 1/2 out of * * * * . 90 mins . PG for mild violence , language and crude humor .
0 Do not see this movie if you value your mind . At the end of our collective viewing , me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5 % of our brains during its course . The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer.<br /><br />Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth . I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion , this movie has bred a deep hatred within me . I hate this movie so very , very much.<br /><br />Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously . If only it did n't take itself seriously . But it does . The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runner - esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies . The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful . Whoopee Goldberg is n't even trying , but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul . And whether its Juliet Landua with her off again on again British accent or Richard Roundtree ( aka Shaft ) as the blustering Commissioner , you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall .
0 I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT . Even he could n't make this movie enjoyable . The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though . It 's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.<br /><br />If you took the actual film , dipped it in paint thinner , then watched it , it would be more entertaining . Seriously.<br /><br />If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S - Mart , back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake .
0 Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 m ? Let me give you a choice ; you can either a ) shred it and flush it down the toilet or b)make a film based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like " I did n't butt trumpet " and blows raspberries on the basis that this is funny . That 's right , you would choose the option that has more merit - flushing down the toilet.<br /><br />This has to be seen to be believed . I can not even find the words to describe how bad this film is . It does n't even fit into the " so bad - it 's good " category . I actually have it on the television as I write - and whilst watching I felt the need to come onto IMDb and register my disgust.<br /><br />Considering Jurassic Park was made a couple of years before , how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit ? WG should have simply walked and damn the consequences . Everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money.<br /><br />I have to stop writing - I am about to implode .
0 This movie was amazingly bad . I do n't think I 've ever seen a movie where every attempt at humor failed as miserably . Let 's see ... the acting was pathetic , the " special effects " where horrible , the plot non - existant ... that pretty much sums up this movie.<br /><br / >
0 There have been very few films I have not been able to sit through . I made it through Battle Field Earth no problem . But this , This is one of the single worst films EVER to be made . I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to get of acting in it . I do not blame her . I would feel ashamed to have this on a resume . I belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it 's face . Well it happens here . Not to mention the SFX , look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end ! ! ! ! ! ! Halfway through the film I was still looking for a plot . I never found one . Save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life .
0 I must say that during my childhood I 'm quite proud of a lot of the movies I 've rented . The exception being Theodore Rex . Talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor 's resume . Could you just imagine what Whoopie 's fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap " Hey Whoop , you ever seen that show Dinosaurs , yeah well they 're making a movie out of it , and you get to see Germany ! " After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot.<br /><br />This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed . I just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory , because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie . I mean c'mon , I 'll even admit I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters ( good reasons why I gave up on both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for awhile ) , yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood , and the biggest rental regret of my life , and that was 16 years ago . I 'm 24 now if you want to do the math.<br /><br />Whenever I think of my all - time list of worst movies I do n't even mention this one , because like a raped step - child , I try hard to repress that it ever happened . Screw you Whoopie , just be glad people only acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff .
0 I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT . Even he could n't make this movie enjoyable . The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though . It 's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.<br /><br />If you took the actual film , dipped it in paint thinner , then watched it , it would be more entertaining . Seriously.<br /><br />If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S - Mart , back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake .
0 I can say nothing more about this movie than : Man , this SUCKS ! ! ! ! ! If you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain , watch this movie . It 's the best cure in the world for taking away happiness . When I started watching this film , I was completely happy . Afterwords I could feel my brain melting , like it was struck by molten lava . God , I HATE that stupid Dinosaur . So if you want severe brain damage : Watch this movie , it will do the trick .
0 Joe Don Baker . He was great in " Walking Tall " and had a good bit - part in " Goldeneye " , but here in " Final Justice " all hope is gone ... the dark side has won . < br /><br />As with most of humanity , my main experience with this one was on MST3 K , and what an experience it was ! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker 's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely . It 's obvious they were just beginning with " Mitchell " on their anti - Joe Don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme.<br /><br />It makes for a funny experience , though : there are plenty of choice riffs . My favorites - " John Rhys - Davies for sale " , " It 's ' Meatloaf : Texas Ranger ' " , " none of them are sponge - worthy " , " Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed " , and my favorite - " ' Son of a ... ' ? What ? What was he the son of : son of a PREACHER MAN?" < br /><br />By itself , " Final Justice " is , as Joe Don puts it in the movie , " a big fat nada " . But here , it actually has some entertainment value . You get a chance , catch THIS version of " Final Justice".<br /><br />Two stars for " Final Justice " . Ten for the MST3 K version ONLY.<br /><br />Oh , and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don 's in town .
0 In short , the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing , somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast , and the 3rd act ... there virtually was n't ANY 3rd act!<br /><br />Regarding the 3rd act , the movie just abruptly ends . There is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act , so there was n't much of a 3rd act . The bad guys die and that 's that ; the end credits roll . There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on . The audience would 've likely left the theater after the movie , asking " that 's it ? " A real letdown.<br /><br />Music was composed by David Bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time , but it 's certainly nothing outstanding . It 's just functional , but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative . It is also apparent that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion . What least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of James Horner from " 48 HRS . " and " Commando , " particularly the brass.<br /><br />In all , the film had potential as the basic story itself is good , but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction , weak acting , and somewhat inconsistent pacing.<br /><br />There was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story , and this omission is major and unforgivable as it does n't allow the movie to end satisfactorily . This could either be the screenplay or , possibly , the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints ( but I 'm speculating as to why there is n't a 3rd act ) . Whatever the reason , the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall . < br /><br />This is good for a view if you 're curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap as well as to learn the reason WHY you need to have the 3 acts ( beginning , middle , end ) if you write screenplays and make movies.<br /><br />Otherwise , you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3 K version to at least get some laughs out of it .
0 After apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss , Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo , III , is assigned the task of taking the killer back to Italy . On the way , however , the plane is diverted to Malta . Not long after landing , the killer escapes . Now , and with little help from the Maltese police , Deputy Sheriff Geronimo is out to recapture a murderer . But will his " shoot first , take names later " brand of Texas justice work in a foreign country ? < br /><br />Let me get this out right up front , I 've seen Final Justice both with and without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary . I 've seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole . And I 've seen the cut - up TV version that was used for MST3K. Having said that , I 've got to admit that I much prefer the MST3 K version . Why ? Because Final Justice is one lousy movie . The MST3 K commentary helps make it much more palatable . On its own , it 's a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue ( often delivered with such thick Italian accents that it 's impossible to understand ) , bad acting , weak direction , gigantic plot holes , and most everything else you 'll find in a bad movie . And if most of Final Justice was n't " so bad , it 's good " , it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else . So , yes , I enjoy the often very funny MST3 K commentary over the bad movie on its own.<br /><br />My main sticking points with the MST3 K commentary and with most of the reviews I 've read on Final Justice , however , involve the criticisms of Joe Don Baker . The main weaknesses in Baker 's performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction . Instead , I think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place . Joe Don Baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor , but he 's not the kind of guy I would call an " action hero " by any stretch of the imagination . He 's more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of James Bond movies . Or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with Final Justice , point your finger at director Greydon Clark . Clark 's resume ca n't begin to compare with Baker 's . So I say , " Lay off Joe Don Baker ! "
0 The only words you need fear more than Joe Don Baker if your thinking of watching a film are Greydon Clark , and if they are both there , run for your life . However this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously ! It starts out bad and goes downhill from there , repeated scenes , the Good The Bad and The Ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter .Yes , he 's the best deputy sheriff in Texas , tracking a mafia hit - man to Malta as only he can . He makes his own rules , does things his own way , all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style . You want to see a bad but funny film ? Go ahead on , its your move !
0 Two qualifiers right up front : I actually think Joe Don Baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director ( the " Cape Fear " remake , a small role in " Goldeneye " , " Walking Tall " ) . And I even liked Baker in " Mitchell " , because he was playing an anti - hero who was SUPPOSED to be unlikeable . Yes , MST3 K 's coverage was hilarious , but they took a lot of cheap shots at Baker - that he did n't deserve - to keep things lively and entertaining - he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie , and he was the best part of the movie.<br /><br />"Final Justice " seems to be more of the same , but in spite of the exotic locations and the " cowboy frontier justice " theme , it is quite a bit weaker than " Mitchell " . And the main reason is that Baker 's character , as written , is an idiot . The movie has the conceit that because Baker embodies old style frontier machismo , he challenges his opponents to old style mano - a - mano quick - draw contests . And because he 's so tough and macho , he always wins , even when he 's hurt , wounded , outnumbered , etc.<br /><br />That 's a conceit with a lot of potential ( it worked for Gary Cooper ) , even if it condemns the film to " B " movie status . But Baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy 's henchman to a showdown in a public market , with civilians all over the place . He COULD have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guy 's headquarters ( which was why he was following them in the first place ) and they never would have noticed . Or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender , and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point . But no , he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead , and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout ! < br /><br />This is a guy we are supposed to admire ? < br /><br />The whole movie is basically like this . Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK ( the henchmen ) to pretty good ( the chief bad guy and his father , who are two well known European actors - they just go through the motions , but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent ) . But through it all , Baker 's character pulls silly , unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed , plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force.<br /><br />On the positive side , since 90 % of the movie is set on Malta or in the Mediterranean , you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras . And really , Baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic , but he is n't that bad ... certainly not the tub o ' lard that this films critics ( including Mike and the Bots in their hilarious coverage ) seem to think.<br /><br />In short , this movie is good for video wallpaper , but the viewer should not pay any attention to it .
0 I ca n't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984 . It 's got some laughable acting , not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever . Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy ? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact , it 's about as generic a title for a wannabe action / cop film as I can think of.<br /><br />I'm glad I only saw this on MST3 K with Mike and the bots as a shield . They remark on the female lead 's resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld ( " None of them are spongeworthy " ) and riff non - stop on Baker 's weight . This movie probably is n't worse than " Mitchell , " but Baker 's reputation definitely precedes him here : when his title comes up at the beginning of the film , Tom says , " I wish I was illiterate so I would n't have to read that . "
0 I can count ( on one hand ) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker . This is not one of them.<br /><br />Interminable chase scenes , dim - witted dialogue , and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send - up on MST3K.<br /><br />And that is the only way I was able to watch this ...
0 What reviewers and MST3 K left out is the best part ( and only memorable scene ) of this otherwise dreadful movie : There is a very good rape - in - the - shower scene committed by the bad guy ( Ben Gazzara look - alike ) on Maria ( as mentioned , killed later through T.J. 's ineptitude ) . Perhaps rape is too strong a word , " prison mating ritual " may be more appropriate . The background behind this chance , yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding " Ben Gazzara , " introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool . The 30-ish blonde disses him , but our villain must be quite smitten by her , because the courtship is on at that point . His first move is to attempt drowning her , until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off . Kind of like the girl in high school you did n't like , but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway ... Let 's just say , he catches UP with her in the cabana later .
0 There are movies that are awful , and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long - forgotten and unwatchable . Also , lots of violence and bad stuff ( not just cheesy stuff ; you know what I mean ) add to the mix as well . What is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content ? Why , " Final Justice , " of course ! < br /><br />Remember " Mitchell ? " Joe Don Baker was the star of that movie , and that was riffed by Joel and the Bots on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 . " Now this time , with Mike taking Joel 's place on the Satellite of Love ( but with the same bots ) , that trio got to make fun of MST3 K 's second Joe Don Baker movie , " Final Justice . " Of course , much of the naughty stuff that I mentioned was removed for television release , but still , I want to watch that episode ( and " Mitchell " as well ) , because what does Joe Don " hate " the most ? Why , none other than " Mystery Science Theater 3000 ! " < br /><br />P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby , check that store for the uncut tape ! LOL That happened to another user !
0 Jimmy Dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish . Hysterical if viewed through the eyes of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 , which I rate as a 10 . I mean , the sight of this obese , corn - fed hog trouncing around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory , if you make it that far into the film . This ugly , hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of " Booty Call " , " Pumpkinhead " , " Swarm " , and " The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh " . A -gulp- film like this proves that sometimes actors , writers , producers , etc . get behind on their mortgage , or get stoned to the point of insanity . It begs the question " who was so stupid to finance such a whale ? " But then , had good judgment prevailed and " Final Justice " never was , then we would n't have the delightful spoof voice - over in " Mystery Science Theatre 3000 " !
0 I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck . The concept of the film was n't very good to start with . This movie has so many bad things about it I do n't know where to start . The acting is horrible . The cinematography is marginal at best . The soundtrack was pretty bad . The score is terrible . There 's a reason why this movie ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I voted before I wrote this and I can not believe that 9 people actually thought this " film " is excellent . They must have liked the two go - go dancers . Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again ! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves .
0 Joe Don 's opening line says everything about this movie . It takes place on the island of Malta ( the island of pathetic men ) and involves Joe Don Baker tracking down an Italian mobster . Joe Don 's character is named Geronimo ( pronounced Heronimo ) and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over agin . Everyone in the movie hates him , just like everyone hates Greydon Clark . I liked an earlier Greydon picture , " Angel 's Revenge " because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys . Avoid this movie at all costs ! !
0 From the Star of " MITCHELL " , From the director of " Joysticks " and " Angel 's Revenge " ! ! ! These are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie . And the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ! ! ! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this film . It 's like a bad remake of " Coogan 's Bluff "
0 I did n't think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb ' Mitchell ' , but this one succeeds.<br /><br />I would n't recommend this if you 're a fan of Joe Don Baker 's MUCH better work . But , if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really , really drawn out gun fights , you 'll love this movie .
0 This movie was just heckled by MST3 K and with good reason . First and foremost because it is a " cop " movie starring Joe Don Baker , who we all know is about as good a cop actor as Michael Jackson is a country western singer.<br /><br />All the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads , bar fights , children hostages in shoot outs , bad acting , lame police chiefs , bad acting , revenge / justice , endless goons , and of course , bad acting . Do n't watch this without an MST3 K filter folks .
0 I 've never been impressed by JD anyway , and Final Justice ( which I had n't seen prior to its MST3k airing ) proves to be no exception . It 's not that the character is any less likeable than Mitchell : it 's just that there 's less that Geronimo ( " Call me ' Heronimo ' ) to dislike.<br /><br />In fact , one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all schemes of a revenge - seeking agent of Joe Don 's trying to get the " star " killed by inducing a heart attack.<br /><br />Joe Don must have found a new agent , since he 's now graduated to " comic relief " in James Bond movies . The problem is , it 's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there , and his " serious " characters in his action - movies like this one.<br /><br />As for the plot ... umm , what plot ? They repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you 'll think you were watching Groundhog 's Day 2 . Presumably , the fact they keep using the same scene of Geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort . Ummm , yeah , whatever.<br /><br />On the plus side , the Malta scenery is pretty gorgeous , so that kicked it up to a 2 for me . One suspects this flick set Maltese tourism back a couple of decades , though .
0 Sergio Leone spins in his grave ... If there was any film that tramples upon a man 's life work its this one . The lead character 's " lone wolf " bravado is uninspiring and lame , and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education . Whoever 's idea this was should be horse whipped . The only reason I 'm spending time trashing it is because there 's a 10 line minimum . Sergio Leone 's family should sue , not because its crap , but because now it 's immortalized as crap by MST 3000 . Shame . Disgust . I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey makes crap that wo nt offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts ... this film is pure blasphemy .
0 Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas , shooting people who shoot people . Then he 's off to Malta where he shoots more people . He gets locked up many times for shooting people . Then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy , who is dressed like a monk . There is a boat chase , and Joe Don winds up in jail again . Finally Joe Don , with the help from Elaine from " Seinfeld " kill the bad guy , blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare . All this and a catchy theme song , just like Mitchell !
0 This movie was not made by Who fans . Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half - hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over : In Christmas , they did n't show Daltry 's screams after the line " Tommy does n't know what day it is ... " , they showed almost * no * Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard , there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror , and worst of all , in the second half of We 're Not Gon na Take It ( Listening to You ) , they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete 's blazing guitar chords . Huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band . It 's a very frustrating film to watch , and does n't deliver the goods . I do n't know if director Murry Lerner is just not a Who fan , or worse , for him at least , if he * is * a Who fan and this is all the * eight * cameras could deliver for him . To its credit , there are some rare numbers before Tommy , as well as some faves , that are very well shot , and sometimes the editing is brilliant . This might be enough to make some viewers happy , as long as you 're not anticipating Tommy . The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV ; it may be different on video or DVD .
0 What a boring film ! To sum it all up , its was basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughter - in - law Karisma Kapoor , while she tried to flee from the village , with her son . Can someone say BORING ? ? ? The concept was n't too bad , but it was poorly executed . The Canadian locales , and some of the village scenes were nicely shot . However , overall the cinematography came up short . The story could have been great , but the movie just seemed to drag on . There is only so much stupidity a person can take , let alone three bloody hours of it.<br /><br />The best part of the whole movie was the song " Ishq Kamina " , and that was only five minutes long . Other than that , this movie was a piece of crap .
0 I saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema . I had some hopes for the movie because I really like Spoorloos ( The Vanishing ) and the book it 's based on . The movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller . Quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines , characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for ( like Marjoke ) and terrible editing . The movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long , a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just do n't add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped . After suffering through the story you 'll get treated to one of the worst endings I 've seen in a very long . It should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you 're probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies . It 's hard to mention any good things about this movie . About a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and I did n't hear a kind word after the movie was over . Avoid this movie at all costs . it really destroyed any faith I had left in the dutch movie industry .
0 With movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts . Eva as a ghost is pretty funny . And the other actors also do a good job . It is the direction and the story that is lacking . That could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better . The problem only is that there are n't many jokes . Sure I laughed a couple of times . Apart from the talking parrot there was n't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie . I blame the director not using the premise to it 's full potential . Eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so . Overall this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon . Other than that it can be skipped completely .
0 I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body actually was n't as bad as I was expecting , my mom wanted to see it , so I rented it . I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes , but actually this was n't too bad . I was just expecting this horrific movie , but it seems like the writers meant no harm , but the casting of Eva Longoria(Parker , sorry ) , she seems a little off set for the movie . I think I may have found it to be a little better without her , just she does annoy me . But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable . But you have to admit , there was no point to this movie , it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing . The movie could 've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.<br /><br />Henry just lost his bride to be , Kate , who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day . But when his sister takes him to a psychic , Ashley , Henry falls for her , but Kate is haunting her from beyond the grave . Kate is jealous and does n't want Henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that Ashley does n't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles , believe me , with Kate 's voice , that 's scary.<br /><br />Over Her Dead Body is an alright movie , not sure if it 's worth the money , but I 'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious . Eva Longoria just does n't have enough star power to make the film work , no offense to those who love her , she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen . Not to mention the character of Ashley , she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls , or her " gay " friend , Dan , just again , not really likable . Just with some re - writing and proper attention , this film could have been better , but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.<br /><br />4/10
0 The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate , who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the " I do 's " with fiancé Henry(Paul Rudd ) . After two years Henry has yet to move on and his sister Chloe(Lindsay Sloane)is very concerned . Chloe arranges for Henry to talk with an attractive psychic Ashley(Lake Bell ) . Ashley is to contact Kate 's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life . When the psychic starts getting attracted to Henry , Kate 's ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud . There are some funny situations ; but if you 've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film . Also in the cast : Stephen Root , Jason Biggs , William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon - Covey . I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker . And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt . Still this movie was over - hyped .
0 " So there 's this bride , you see , and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding . Then , get this , a year later , her former fiancé falls in love with a beautiful psychic   and then , that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriend  he he  it 'll be hilarious!. " Polite chuckling.<br /><br />This , I like to envision , is how Jeff Lowell , the man who dreamed up " Over Her Dead Body , " presented his concept to the studio execs over there at New Line Cinema . The big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project , allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay.<br /><br />For if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds , then clearly you have another think coming . The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no - holds - barred satirical farce . Instead , wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy , inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy , Lowell engages in boring half - measures every step of the way , tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality . Indeed , " Over Her Dead Body " is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it 's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it . Virtually every set - up , joke and sight gag in the film is flat - footed and poorly executed , with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament . How else to explain the halfhearted , lifeless performances of Paul Rudd , Eva Langoria Parker , Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles ? < br /><br />I choose not to blame the actors , some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past ( that is particularly the case with Rudd ) . But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some ' splainin ' to do .
0 Jeff Lowell has written & directed ' Over Her Dead Body ' poorly . The idea is first of all , is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film . Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested . Lake Bell is a complete miscast . She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance . Jason Biggs is wasted , so is Lindsay Sloane.<br /><br />I expected entertainment more from this film . Sadly , I did n't get entertained .
0 This movie is similar to the play entitled ' Blithe Spirit ' written by Noel Coward . The plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to Coward 's writing . I 'm surprised that movies of this nature do n't acknowledge the original writer 's concept . I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is.<br /><br />Sad . These movies are so expensive to produce . I do perk up when a screenplay is original . I even perk up when it 's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released . There were some samples mentioned ( such as Topper , etc . ) . < br /><br />I realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment . However , I 'm not please when the public 's taste is taken for granted . In this situation , the public 's taste is overlooked.<br /><br />I look forward to better produced movie entertainment.<br /><br />In this case . I rather see the play .
0 This film is shoddily - made , unoriginal garbage . I like romantic comedies sometimes . Watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner . It 's not something you are going to do all the time , but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being . This movie made me think about how stupid I was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time . Everything about it screamed made on the cheap . It actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out . It boasts cheesy CGI and lame sets , too.<br /><br />The writing was clunky . I know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy , but you usually do n't really care because you are laughing . This movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved . Events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition . Sure , this is how all movies work , but you should n't notice that it 's happening . Inelegant . That 's the term I should use.<br /><br />There was almost no one in the movie who was really likable . I did n't care who ended up with whom , as long as they all stayed the hell away from me , and I did n't have to listen to them talk about it anymore . Why would the only really cool character in the movie , the Paul Rudd character , want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy , condescending , control freak played by Eva Longoria ? Also , almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation . A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out ( and bathe with ) with a woman he is attracted to ? The best feel - good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with Rudd 's equally annoying lying , kleptomaniac sister ? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive , appealing women . Maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road .
0 Was this the greatest movie that I have ever seen ? No . Was it the worst ? No.<br /><br />As a mother of four kids , it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing . It was great , but it was cute.<br /><br />I think that it definitely had some room to improve , but it tried.<br /><br />I am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer . They obviously do not care for Eva Longoria . I think that she was better in this than in The Sentinel . I think that movies are a matter of opinion . The actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop.<br /><br />Maybe the cast did not work out . Maybe there were too many things going on.<br /><br />I just wanted to speak up for an average movie , not a terrible one . It could just be a chick flick . Kind of like the movie The Split - Up or French Kiss . My husband still talks about those . :)
0 There have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of Hollywood . Cary Grant was an angel in " The Bishop 's Wife " ( 1947 ) . Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late ' 30s - early ' 40s . And , more recently , Warren Beatty 's " Heaven Can Wait " ( 1978 ) , which was a remake of 1941 's " Here Comes Mr. Jordan . " These were well - written , funny , entertaining comedies , all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels.<br /><br />Now comes writer - director Jeff Lowell , making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable , bitchy young woman , Kate ( Eva Longoria Parker ) , who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist , Ashley ( Lake Bell ) who is falling for Kate 's fiancé , Henry ( Paul Rudd ) . One thing that is clear at the outset : Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett ( Marion Kerby in the first two " Topper " films ) , who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured.<br /><br />There is a line right at the beginning when Henry 's sister , Chloe ( Lindsay Sloane ) tells Henry , " You do n't smile . " That aptly described my situation throughout this film.<br /><br />The main problem with the film is that the script just is n't very funny . But it 's made worse by Longoria Parker 's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen . Just to start out with , compounding her lack of comedic talent , she is covered with so much pancake makeup , who knows what she really looks like ? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue . She 's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her ( well , she actually just fades out ) , so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is.<br /><br />Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate 's death ( from what I saw of Kate , he should have felt a wonderful relief ) , so she introduces him to Ashley , who really does n't know what she 's doing as a spiritualist ( she is also a cateress to make ends meet ) , to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate . There 's a lot of meshugaas that goes on.<br /><br />The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a " B " story revolving around Ashley 's assistant , Dan ( Jason Biggs ) . This is thrown in near the end , but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she 's as much of a boob as Kate . Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women , he deserves whatever he gets.<br /><br />Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin . It does n't , and more 's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny . As it is , Norman Z. McLeod , Constance Bennett , Roland Young , Alan Mowbray , and Co. must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two " Topper " films has wrought .
0 This movie is one of the worst ones of the year . The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible . Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent , and the only one that is not annoying . I have never watched Desparte Housewives , so I do n't know how Eva Longoria is on that show , but in this movie she was horrible . It 's like she knows nothing about acting . All her character does is whine throughout the film , and she ca n't pull off being a b * * * * and still be entertaining . And the other girl , Lake Bell , displays little emotion and it 's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story , it is so cookie cutter . It goes from point A to B with little surprise . So much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost . The plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : It 's not worth watching .
0 I had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments .. <br /><br />I was hoping it might improve,<br /><br />What I saw was badly acted , directed & written.<br /><br />This movie should never even have been released directly to DVD,.<br /><br />The lead character who is a bride top be from HELL has an huge Ice sculpture fall on her killing her . She was such a revolting person I was not even sorry for her . She winds up there in a sort of heaven , & was still repulsive , I left shortly after.<br /><br />Eve Longoria portrays her & I hope I never see her again , she ca nt even act . She is just plain annoying.<br /><br />Paul Rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud.<br /><br />Jason Biggs ( no longer a teen ) is also present,<br /><br />I do like comedies BUT not stupid ones about stupid people.<br /><br />Rating : * ( out of 4 ) 30 points ( out of 100 ) IMDb 2 ( out of 10 )
0 Henry , a veterinarian ( Paul Rudd ) , and his bossy fiancé , Kate ( Eva Longoria ) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception . It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy , giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation . But , horror of horrors , the " angel " ice sculpture , ordered by Kate , arrives without wings . In an ensuing fight with the sculptor , the heavy " ice " maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter . Now , one year later , Henry 's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward . Yet , the lovely medium , Ashley ( Lake Bell ) becomes interested in Henry herself , much to the chagrin of her catering partner ( Jason Biggs ) . More importantly , Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley , as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry . Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good ? This is an abysmal romantic comedy , one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen . No , its not the cast , as they try gamely to make things work . Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious . Biggs , a funny thespian , too , is totally wasted . As for Rudd , a very gifted performer ( see Anchorman , Knocked Up , or Clueless , please ) he tries hardest of all and , in truth , is the main reason to see this clunker . His charm , looks , and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable . But , nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner , absolutely nothing . So , if you are a dyed - in - the - wool fan of romantic comedy , think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one . Even were free tickets to fall into your lap , be warned that this movie is a near - death experience for those who adore love - and - laugh cinema .
0 I confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies , and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror , but when it comes to comedies , they really need to be crazy to be funny . ' Over Her Dead Body ' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously , and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect I can think about . The story is completely unbelievable of course , and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register . The choice of the principal actresses was awful . While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy , the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too aged ( sorry ) for him , and Lake Bell seems too unattractive ( sorry again ) . A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start . Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles . The rest is uninteresting and uninspired , with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies . Nothing really worth watching , nothing to remember .
0 this movie was terrible . i thought with all the some what decent actors , it would be better . do n't waste your time . Eva longoria parker was awful . she should stick to desperate housewives . Paul Rudd is becoming a B actor . the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i 'm saying . and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons . watch just like heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a tad better . or any other ghost movie . you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time . PS i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance ! time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it .
0 Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel ( without wings ) falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her . She is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex - boyfriend with his new girlfriend , a psychic who can see her.<br /><br />Obvious unoriginal movie would n't be bad in a clichéd sort of way , except that Longoria 's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film . Its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper . To be fair Longoria , nor anyone else in the cast or crew , is n't the problem , its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings . Its just really really stupid .
0 Well this is the first post am ever commenting on IMDb . , do you get it , this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with movies.<br /><br />As most of them have given their comments I thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors(though having read worst critics against this movie ) I thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick . , Well it all started well with some ahem . , comedies .... then it all started going pathetic ... man you can believe your self , you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless ... Huh~~ Well how much can a person digest a sick all POSSESSIVE witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing.<br /><br />The next worst thing about the movie is , the " ZOMBIE " Hero , yes as he looses his fiancé he roams around like a Goat , with black marks under his eyes . , and with the hero 's " terribly stupid " sister .. you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie~ !
0 i did n't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min . of that movie again i think I 'm going to shoot myself ... and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i was n't surprised at all i mean who did n't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that . i know i did n't miss anything and if somebody ask 's me to see that movie i would say " over my dead body " .
0 Much of " Over Her Dead Body " is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors.<br /><br />Eva Longoria proves that she ca n't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy , and further , that she does n't really even have any comedic timing . She 's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé . The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd , drippy and charmless , while the psychic is played by Lake Bell , bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has . I felt most sorry for Bell , as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work . Unfortunately , she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable , and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of " Titanic . " < br /><br />"Over Her Dead Body " actually pi**ed me off , because of its laziness and utter lack of effort . I started to think of all the interesting projects that ca n't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this . Seriously , does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough ? How stupid do they really think the movie - going public is ? < br /><br />Grade : F
0 You know you are in trouble watching a comedy , when the only amusing parts in it are from the Animal cast . It is a pity then that the parrot , Cat & Dog were only in support & not the other way around , as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout.<br /><br />If I were you , Paul , Eva , Lake ( what sort of name is that ) , Jason , & Lindsay , I would forget this acting lark & do something else , as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry , & awful actors to boot.<br /><br />The main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting , me not Gay , which is funny as if you were n't , you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy , tedious & dare I say very plain women leads in the film.<br /><br />The worst film I have seen in years , & hopefully never see one as bad again , though I expect not .
0 Sorry guys , I 've already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews . There are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but what 's scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie . I do n't like to write nasty reviews or criticise other people 's opinions but I think it 's only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie . This is not a good movie . I really like movies and I 'll watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave halfway through . If you really are incredibly tempted , watch the trailer ... that 's the mistake I made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer ... after that there are no surprises , just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time . I love Michael Vartan in Alias and would hate to criticise him but I think it 's my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this ! !
0 This really was the worst movie I have ever seen . Michael Vartan is hot , but who is this woman ? And she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie , the hair is so bad ! They talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry . The cover of the DVD does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is . Really , really boring . I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch . I really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good ? hhaha they literally just like talk and say " yeah " and there is no passion whatsoever . I could not tell at all that they were in love . I 'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I have ever seen .
0 Sure , it had some of the makings of a good film . The storyline is good , if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though I did n't understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the US . My biggest problem , however , was with the wardrobe . I know as rule , the average American is considered a frumpy dresser by any self - respecting European but this was beyond that . Anna 's colour combinations were positively ghastly ! ! And that potato sack - like , sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives . I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible ( how many school teachers walk around in Prada ? ) but simple does n't mean an absolute lack of taste . A word to the wise ...
0 I just want to make one thing clear- I love Michael Vartan ! But this film really lets him down . His acting is still superb , he 's still as charming as ever , and he still looks great . But the film itself is a load of rubbish ! Natasha Henstridge , I 'm sorry to say it , comes over bit manly ... you 're constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend , who 's own sub - storyline is a little weird . Myself and my family ( who sat down and watched the film with me ) were also put off by the soundtrack to the film ; at times the music just did n't fit with what was going on in the scenes . However , even this was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing film . I could forgive the leading lady 's butch - ness , I could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix , and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment , but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end ? ? ? The ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold . If you 're a Michael Vartan fan skip this film : buy yourself a poster instead .
0 Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - " At Last " . This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone .
0 Look , there 's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film , it 's just boring . It 's a typical rom - com with an ending you can see coming before you 've seen so much as the trailer . The key difference is that the classic rom - coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension . This movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement , you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment . The production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago . I 'd recommend re - watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow imitation . Oh , one other BIG problem ... no chemistry . If you 're used to seeing Michael looking all cute as Vaughn in Alias , you 're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they 've made him look here .
0 I 'm a sucker for a good romance , but this one does n't qualify as either good or a romance . I had the plot nailed down before the credits were through . With such poor dialog , plot and character development , I suggest investing your hour and a half elsehere . I had to rush out and rent Serendipity for the third time so I could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth .
0 Poorly structured , badly written , loaded with cliches and flat dialogue . Not a single scene shines . The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises , plot twists or conflict . You know from the first ten minutes where it 's going.<br /><br />For a movie set in NY , it has almost no feeling for the city . There are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget . This one seems like it was shot in Toronto.<br /><br />If you cast Natasha Henstridge , why dress her in baggy sweaters ? Why make Vartan look boring and drab ? Where 's the attraction ? I felt like I was watching a sub - par Christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing.<br /><br />Steven Feder 's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie .
0 " It had to be You " is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas . This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned Author . When Charlie 's fiancé goes out of town he 's stuck with all of the wedding planning . He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married . The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together . This is when the plot gets boring , Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie . This movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else . Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch .
0 This is supposed to be well - researched and based on fact . How come therefore that it 's so packed with McGovernisms . Did the people of Derry live in some kind of bizarre Philip K. Dick world in which reality was uncannily like Cracker/ Liam/ Priest ? Or is McGovern an idle hack who just keeps repeating hims
0 Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood actually was . < br /><br />What I got was a disappointing self - centered , conflictive , contradictory compilation of bitter self - aggrandizing has - beens . < br /><br />Where people DO remember Ed Wood Jr. , do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space ? < br /><br />It appears as though , the very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood , these people come out of the " Wood"work ! Only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no - one else would ! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they did n't get the $ 75 they were promised!<br /><br />Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain . In - fact that was ALL he lived for . You may giggle when you see Ed 's films , but somehow you are aware that you are laughing WITH him , and not AT him . < br /><br />But , I digress ... Back to the film at hand . If you are expecting a film ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr. , you wo n't get it here . If you want a film about cranky bitter old actors , this is the film for you !
0 Essentially a story of man versus nature , this film has beautiful cinematography , the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going . Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation 's foreman , played by Dana Andrews . The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch 's late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch . The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right - of - way . The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture . Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch .
0 ELEPHANT WALK was a thoroughly dull film and I really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film . Considering the money and cast , you 'd sure expect the film to be a lot better , though I also question the odd casting of Dana Andrews as a man who is in love with Elizabeth Taylor . It 's not just the age difference but I just ca n't see the pair as a couple . Perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting Miss Taylor for Vivian Leigh at the last minute ( due to Miss Leigh 's deteriorating mental condition)--though I also have a hard time visualizing Andrews and Leigh as well . In addition , for an English woman , Miss Taylor does n't even seem to try using an accent.<br /><br />The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor meeting and marrying in England . Their plan is to return to Finch 's tea plantation in Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) and at first it seems like a good life . However , there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her . On top of that , once back home , Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable . Neighbor Andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her . However , Taylor is n't yet ready to abandon her marriage . But , through the course of the film Finch treats Liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave ... when out of the blue , Cholera strikes the plantation . So it 's up to Andrews , Finch and Taylor to work together to save the day -- though by this point I really did n't care , as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters , the dialog is pretty dull and you ca n't understand why Taylor did n't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell.<br /><br />The film is n't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by Paramount , the film is a sluggish mess . I particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location , many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected ( and grainy ) shot that was n't integrated well . In one scene , for instance , Taylor , Finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green . Then , when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them , the grass is brown ! It 's clear they really are NOT in Ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining Buddha . My advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake . Despite its budget , it 's just not a very good or inspired film.<br /><br />By the way , could Miss Taylor have been pregnant during part of this film ? In some scenes ( particularly at the beginning ) she 's wearing billowy clothes , has a double - chin and looks puffy . This is n't a criticism -- after all , women do get pregnant ! But if you look carefully , you 'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Also by the way , the basic plot in many ways is similar to GIANT -- a great Taylor film indeed ! It 's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much .
0 the author of the book , by the same title , should not have let her name be used for this movie . if you have read the book , this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details . the movie adds nothing , in terms of artistic merit , to the book 's own literary achievement.<br /><br />for those who have not read the book : you will also be disappointed . not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace , it does n't offer anything more while it is moving slowly ( like character development , for example ) . some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie , but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle -- its fairly tame and not imaginative at all .
0 I 'm not sure how related they are , but I 'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie ( or the story that it 's based on ) . Very similar plotline , and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very , very similar . Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie , so see that one instead.<br /><br />This one moves very slowly , but being a late 60s French movie , that is to be expected of the style . Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school . The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first , particularly since the audio from each overlaps ( ie , hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa ) . Also , the " girls " are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school . Finally , not much character development to even get you attached to the movie .
0 Shallow , shallow script ... stilted acting ... the shadows of boom mikes lingering over the actors ' heads in scenes ... worth watching because Kate Mulgrew plays the most selfish mother in TV movie history and it 's all before Ben Affleck got his teeth capped .
0 The tragedy of the doomed ship Titanic has inspired many books and movies . The battle between nature and technology always caught man 's imagination . The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron . The story of " Titanic " involves two fictional characters ( Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet ) from different backgrounds ( one is a hobo - artist , the other is an aristocrat ) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.<br /><br />First of all , although using a historical name , this movie had little regard to history . The plot was built around two fictional lovers , French diamond , and treasure hunters . The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background . Many historical facts were simply forgotten . Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings ? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal ? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy . And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.<br /><br />The overall plot was rather shallow ; rich equals greed and corruption , poverty equals compassion and heroism . It is very ironic to spend $ 200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts . There was absolutely no human side shown in anti - heroes . It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil . Casting was also very poor . If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet , you could swear she was his baby - sitter . The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours . First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse . Hearing corny pick up lines such as " I see you " and " This is my side of the ship " generated more pain than the screams of drowning people . Also , jokes were too abundant and rather lame.<br /><br />"Titanic " did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original . The best thing about this film were its special effects , and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.<br /><br />Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense , the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo ( DiCaprio ) , and so the movie became a success . Now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture , so it seems that " Titanic " did achieve something after all .
0 Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James . He brought us wonderfully , thrilling science - fiction such as Terminator and Aliens . These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry . Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era.<br /><br /> ....... and then it happened ................... 1997 ........ countless awards .......... obscene amounts of money ............ outlandish barrage of advertising ............ maximum profit margin ........ Titanic was here!<br /><br />I have never ( ever ) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it , in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going . Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!<br /><br />Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210 , the acting was more wooden than my nephew 's tree house , images meant to terrify were actually comical ( man falling from ship and hitting propeller ) , historically false ( do n't even get me started because there 's too much ) , it had dire theme music ( up there with the bodyguard for cheese ) and the pointless love story was so tedious , self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved ( I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).<br /><br />It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching , bubblegum chewing , boy - with - car chasing , teenage girls ( DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band ) who would drag their sex - starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick - flick hoping to get lucky later ! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point . Millions of dumbed down , culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because " it cost so much to produce it must be great " and " Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies " . < br /><br />The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards . King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based . It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people . < br /><br />However , if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off . Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money , I 'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!<br /><br />It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly , historically false / human interest tripe like " The Patriot " and " Pearl Harbor " .
0 I 've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions . A bunch of kids , 14 to 22 put on the DVD of " Titanic " on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal . Only two of them had actually seen it before . But they all had seen the moment of Kate , Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie . Shortly after the epic started , they started to get restless , some of them left asking the others -- " call us when the iceberg appears " Over an hour and a half into the movie , only the two girls who had seen the movie before , were still there . They started shouting : iceberg , iceberg . A stampede followed , they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic . They sat open mouthed , emitting Ohs and far outs . So , just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene . What is this ? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it . Dr. Zivagho , for instance , had a similar running time , but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time . In " Titanic " Leo teaches Kate how to spit . Look at the faces and hands of the , supposedly , creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship . Look at the historical details , if you can find them . The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink . The real sinking here is of film standards . All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends . The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so , what do I know ?
0 What I think I 'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film , " Phantom Menace " , is that it will likely blow " Titanic " out of the water , if you 'll pardon the pun , when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts , and thereby knock it out of the number one spot . Every time I hear someone declare " Titanic " is the greatest film they 've ever seen , I think to myself , " You do n't see a lot of movies , do you ? " What a travesty . You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than " Titanic " , and for the same price tag.<br /><br />"Well , it won lots of academy awards , lots of people really loved it , " as someone might say in its defence . Well , lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald 's , but that does n't mean it 's high quality . Yes , millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit , that part of the problem for me was the mega - hype over the film . I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately , it did n't live up to the expectations set upon it , which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story . It 's true , " Phantom Menace " will likely suffer a similar fate . but.<br /><br />James Cameron 's " Titanic " is . a ) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece . b ) a three - hour epic that has it 's finest moments given away in the trailer . c ) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment . d ) something left better to documentarians , which I would 've enjoyed much more . e ) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship . f ) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back , therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of . When I meet someone who has n't seen it yet , I say , " I wish I could trade places with you . " g ) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia . How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences ? h ) thankfully a film that was n't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars . i ) a technological achievement in filmmaking , and little else.<br /><br />The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who 'll no doubt come to his defense , and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic 's story , acting or length .
0 First of all , as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs , I feel entitled to comment on the film . I do n't really care how many awards and accolades the film won , but to me it is still an absolutely awful film . Cameron had the resources to make a ' proper ' semi - documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po - faced romantic mush . The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows , to my mind , the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days . Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love ? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one . I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi - documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible . I almost threw up in the last sequence where the ' dead ' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause . Is this an intelligent film ? Ask yourself .
0 I see people writing about how great this movie was . It was horrible ! The acting was sub - par at best . It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo . Where the hell did they get the money ? Anyway , I wanted to learn more about the Titanic ; why it sank , what was running through a lot of people 's minds ; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff . Does anyone realize that certain people did n't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off ? No , you do n't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked ( did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).<br /><br />I did cry in during one scene , though . The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship . It looked like pool water ! I 'm thinking this movie made all this money and they could n't even make the water from the ocean look real ? unbelievable ... <br /><br />Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank .. Just ridiculous . This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the " Nothing to Do With Reality " department .
0 I , like many people , saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in ' 97 . It was a below average film at best , defiantly not the " masterpiece " that all these " Titanic " fanboys like to make it out as . First off , DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it . People just like him because of his looks . His acting " skills " essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy . Second , the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot : girl falls in love with guy , ship they 're on sinks , lots of crappy love scenes thereafter . Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this is n't ingenious in any way whatsoever . Nor is it original . Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3 + hours . I could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot . In conclusion , " Titanic " is the most overrated movie to date . Why it got so much attention and money is beyond me .
0 There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film . Let 's just face it , though , the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate , who are not necessarily the best actors in this film . I 'm not saying they 're not good actors , I 'm saying they stunk in this film . The special effects were decent ( and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye - pleasing ) , but IT even has several major flaws . For instance , right before the ship goes under , you can see an unfinished blue - screen image behind your main characters.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic , but I find this movie an insult to that story . Editing was atrocious -- there 's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours ( with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie ) , and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.<br /><br />I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted ( and not just the " My Heart Will Go On " song either ) . There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard . That could very well be the highlight of the film . As for the mood throughout , it was extremely dull . I was more relieved than sad when Jack died , which I know can not be what the director intended.<br /><br />In a nut shell , I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over - hyped chick flick .
0 What a piece of junk this movie was . The premise was okay , but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people ( even the effects in Hercules was better ) I knew this would be bad . But the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs . It 's completely incoherent , silly and stupid . I felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a D- . I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie through.<br /><br />I've had my share of cheesy and bad movies ( I love the tremors series ) , but this ... I do not recommend it at all . It 's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe .
0 " The fallen ones " falls under the waste of life ( WOL ) category . I am sad that I am now two hours older was not entertained . My other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy . I felt sorry for the actors ( Wagner ) . I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any loss of plot . It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all . In my humble opinion , The 42 foot mummy should have been 8 - 10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons . The heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges . Later after everything was screwed up by the evil people . The heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong .
0 Some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to Earth , decided to disregard what he 'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans . Reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall , is beyond ridiculous . There was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world , that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans . These were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human , somewhat supporting the " David and Goliath " tale from the bible . There is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being . If I was rating this movie on my own scale , it would have been a negative value instead of a one ...
0 I saw not so fabulous rating on IMDb , but I went to see it anyway , because I am a big fan of Bible related material . First thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie , but it also looked like Casper Van Dien did n't see those Jones movies through ( but he should ) . I believe he tried his best , but script just stunk . Music tried to be kinda Jones style too . Great work , but for such movie it seemed like too much work , like the video part did't deserve all that great music . Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills , he did a good job , but somehow the script was bringing everything down . " Jokes " are old school , somewhere 20 years old ; they brought only cynic smile to my face . There are some really bad camera angels , SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic . Kevin VanHook had probably a good idea on the story ( in my opinion , but I love such stories ) , but things just did n't work out in the end . Maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head . When I ( in first minutes ) saw that movie was going to be one of those ' low budget movies ' , I hoped that I will at least ' hear ' a good story , but sometimes movies just disappoint .
0 The Fallen Ones starts with archaeologist Matt Fletcher ( Casper Van Dien ) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant , now there 's something you do n't see everyday . Matt is working for property developer Morton ( Robert Wagner ) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist Angela ( Kristen Miller ) for reasons I 'm unsure of . Anyway they both try to figure out what they 've got on they 're hands when some of the team go missing , Morton calls in security guy Ammon ( Navid Negahban ) to handle the situation . Meanwhile ancient text translator the Rabbi Eli Schmidtt ( Tom Bosley ) translates some ancient text ( as he would ) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the Fallen One , or something like that . It 's up to Matt to save the day & the whole planet ... <br /><br />Written & directed by Kevin VanHook , who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start , I personally thought The Fallen Ones was a terrible film & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . There are so many things that are just plain bad about The Fallen Ones both on a technical & conceptual level , the script does n't make a whole lot of sense & it does n't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time I had almost lost the will to live . The character 's are awful & as clichéd as you like , the dialogue is bad as in very , very bad & the entire film is predictable , I mean it 's not going to come as a surprise that Casper Van Dien is going to save the day is it ? It 's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state . This is bad , very bad . You have been warned.<br /><br />Director VanHook does n't impress , the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple ? They look naff . To give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant Mummy itself are actually good although there 's not that many of them since he does n't make an appearance for over an hour , there are also some normal sized Mummy 's that look to have come straight from the set of The Mummy ( 1999 ) , unfortunately these are n't used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief . The mechanical Mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on Earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it , actually the more I think about the more ridiculous the idea is . Forget about any scares , tension or atmosphere & do n't even think about any gore or violence because there is n't any.<br /><br />Technically The Fallen Ones is n't anything special & apart from the impressive giant Mummy effects there 's little her to get excited about . The ghost CGI & water effects are terrible , it was made - for - TV & it 's shows . The acting was poor , Wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of Dien & Bosley can get these days.<br /><br />The Fallen Ones is a bad film , there 's no two ways about it as far as I 'm concerned . Not recommended on any level or in any way , one to avoid .
0 I came into this movie really wanting to line it . I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie . Do n't get me wrong here , I was n't expecting Citizen Kane , I was taking this for the B movie that it is . That said , it still fell short of the expectation . The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold . The acting in the movie was very wooden . All in all I give it 4 for a great idea , but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals . Is it worth seeing ? I did n't wish for my two hours back , but I do n't know that I 'd recommend it to others .
0 I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park . It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup . The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end . The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in " On Deadly Ground " as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder . I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew 's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage . The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear . What Robert Wagner , Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie . My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing . On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies . Beware and be safe avoid at all costs .
0 ... from this awful movie ! There are so many things wrong with this film , acting , writing , direction , editing , etc . that it 's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst . The music ! I noted that the film has two composers listed . This must be the reason why every single frame has music , of the absolute worst " D " movie style drivel . They have never heard of the expression " less is more " . It got so painful to listen to , I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue , not that the dialogue was that good . You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley , I 'm sure they did n't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers . See it at your own risk .
0 An archaeologist ( Casper Van Dien ) stumbles accidentally upon an ancient , 40 foot mummy , well preserved underground in the Nevada desert . They are determined to keep this a secret and call in a Jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it . The mummy , as explained at the beginning , is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in " those days " . In order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything , he mummifies his son , burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to awaken him years from then . In our present , the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place . Most of the movie is slow , having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy , air - punching fights . The mummy is decent looking but is n't shown nearly enough . It should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so ... eh . Do n't bother .
0 Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football . Unfortunately , it did n't make the goal . The historical subject of giants is a good one , but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese . I say , take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff . I could n't even watch the entire film . That says a lot because I rarely walk away from any movie . I always like to give them a chance for last - minute redemption . It 's impossible to redeem something this bad . Well , at least the acting was good .... NOT ! < br /><br />The only thing " falling " in this film is the rating . 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers !
0 Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval , a dying , lonely old nut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend , " Do n't try to doctor me , doctor ! I 'm disgustingly healthy ! " He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by " shrinking the brain " ( ? ) < br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Morteval / Karloff ends up dying , and murderous " toys " ( designed by his dead brother ) start killing off the relatives . A mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face , a life - sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing Sheik stabs people with a knife . One guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces . At the end , Julissa and her boyfriend find Karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room . He plays the recurring organ theme music ( sort of a death rattle used for the killings ) , the brother 's spirit starts talking ( " The whole house will go with me ! " ) and the mansion goes up in flames.<br /><br />This senseless mess is too dark , boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips .
0 " House Of Evil " aka " Dance Of Death " of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great Boris Karloff and directed by Jack Hill and Juan Ibánez . Unlike " Snake People " ( 1971 ) , " The Incredible Invasion " ( also 1971 ) and " The Fear Chamber " ( 1972 ) which were all released after Karloff 's death in 1969 , " House Of Evil " was released in 1968 , when Karloff was still alive . " House Of Evil " is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies , which are without doubt all rather crappy , but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are . I personally prefer " The Fear Chamber " and " House Of Evil " over the other two , simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme , and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies , the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor.<br /><br />The odd story ( I do n't know if I can really call it a ' plot ' ) is set somewhere in Europe in the 19th century . After some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out , Mathias Morteval ( Karloff ) , an enthusiastic organ player , invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion , which is full of eerie toys . His kinfolk includes Lucy Durant ( Julissa ) , who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders.<br /><br />I wo n't give away more of the story , but I can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie . There are some very funny moments , especially some things Karloff 's character says . Boris Karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the Horror genre who ever lived , and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness , and although ( or because ) his role is ( due to a poor script and and directing ) in no way scary , it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor . Just like in the movie 's successors " Snake People " and " The Fear Chamber " , the female lead is once again played by Julissa . < br /><br />Most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish , the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt . The storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense . It is the poor story and dialogue , however , that makes this movie so entertaining to watch . " House Of Evil " may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie , but it is certainly as ( unintentionally ) funny as it is bad . Fans of Ed Wood 's movies should be very amused , I personally found it hilarious . Crappy but entertaining nevertheless , and definitely worth watching since there 's Boris Karloff in it and due to the fun factor . 3/10
0 Felt mine was while watching this ... but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film . Not that makes a lot of sense anyway , as others have mentioned , this was one of Karloff 's last films and it 's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all . It 's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this . Marginally , Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much . < br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together . The strident background music does n't help and distracts from any lucid moment . Apart from Boris , the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange , clipped , English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies . < br /><br />At a guess I think it 's Edgar Allen Poe 's ' House of Usher ' that this is taken from but you 'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still , there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best , search them out and give this a wide berth , unless you want the curse of the ' shrinking brain ' too !
0 I could n't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons : Robin Williams and Toni Collete . The film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on . Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon , a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues : his lover moves out and Gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller 's block . One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named Pete Boland ( Rory Culkin ) . Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents . He lives with his adopted mother and social worker , Donna Boland ( Toni Collette ) . Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete , but things seem strange when Gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist . I wo n't go into detail because I do n't want to spoil the film , but I will tell you this : it is quite predictable . Fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from Robin Williams and Toni Collette , who I thought was the film 's key character . Collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses . Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and I hope to see her win an Oscar ( hell , I think she might pull off getting a Best Supporting Actress nod for this one if the script were a little better ) . The film starts off as a psychological thriller , but a predictable one at that . If your curious to know the film 's ending and twists , then see the film otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called " Hide and Seek " .
0 This movie is trash - poor . It has horrible taste , and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real - events - which does n't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment . Direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out - of - place . Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story . To start , Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting . What 's worse , his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device . You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting " d_ck_smker " - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character . Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end . Toni Collete 's character is just plain annoying and a re - hash of her 6th Sense performance with poorer direction . Very Miss - able .
0 I did n't really expect much from " The Night Listener " and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover in the videostore . However , the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension . On occasion it drags a little , but it actually helps to keep you wondering what 's going to happen and more importantly : when . As the movie progresses , the character played by Robin Williams gets dragged into some kind of " cat and mouse " spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no - one seemed to have ever seen in person . The Night Listener is an interesting story , which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you 're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what 's real . However , in the end it kind of disappoints and does n't live up to the potential it could have had . It does n't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character , which would have been helpful and interesting .
0 Robin Williams gave a fine performance in The Night Listener as did the other cast members . However , the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a " must see . " I think the problem happens because there is n't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the Gabriel Noon(I had to spell it this way , because IMDb wants to auto correct the right spelling to " No one " ) character . The movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes , or so it seems , Noon begins his search for Pete Logande , the boy caller.<br /><br />This happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times . The conversations are n't too in - depth mostly consisting of how are you ... I 'm in the hospital ... why did you boyfriend move out ... etc . In the book , the kid almost becomes Noon 's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy , once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax.<br /><br />In the movie , Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande , but the audience is left to wonder why ? Since there really is n't a strong enough bond established between Noon and the caller , why bother ? Who cares if the caller does n't exist ? < br /><br />I know there 's a difference between a book and a movie , but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen , because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie . Since it does n't , the movie falls apart.<br /><br />This is surprising because of Maupin 's other work , Tales of the City . When it was made into a mini - series , it worked beautifully .
0 I felt that the movie was dry ... very disappointing no plot .. kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone .. a wast of money .. One of Robins Williams worst films .. if you do n't believe me wait a few months it will be out on DVD because that seems to be a pattern for movies that do n't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over ... This is one you will not want to see or say why did I spend my money on that!. Plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it .... This was on a Friday night the 9:50 showing . I also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake . When they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying ..
0 My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan . I like him too , but have generally found that he should " stick to what he does best " and focus on comedic roles . My thoughts were confirmed with this movie . I was completely bored throughout the entire film . The story was predictable . I realize it was inspired by a true story . But , my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story . None of the characters were well developed . There was a side story about the main character and his partner . This relationship could have been explored further . More important , though , would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the " boy " . Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into . She obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way . If my husband was n't such a huge Williams fan , we would have left 20 minutes into it . Too bad I ca n't get my $ 20 or 2 hours back .
0 Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold true.<br /><br />BUT .... If I have to sit through a movie were the:<br /><br />Director < br /><br />Director of Photography < br /><br />Editor < br /><br />Can't EVEN miss the darn Microphone Boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every Chapter of the movie , how can I enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when I 'm reminded of the technicalities of making a movie!!!!!!!<br /><br />WAIT FOR THE DVD OR DON'T BOTHER
0 I rarely write a negative review for this site , but this time felt complied to . Night Listener is without doubt one of the dullest films I have ever seen.<br /><br />There was nothing happening in this film what so ever - I did n't care for any of the characters , did n't buy in to the whole mystery type plot , did n't care how it ended .... nothing.<br /><br />There is no comedy , no action , no thrills , no suspense , nothing . The highlights include ( no spoilers - there 's nothing to spoil ) : a man climbing through a window , a dog barking outside a hotel room , a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it 's horn.<br /><br />I really enjoyed " One Hour Photo " and hoped for a similar eerie role from Williams , but alas was sorely let down . What 's more disappointing is that I 'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters , but it just did n't work for me.<br /><br />I might even have given it 1/10 but that score is reserved for the remake of The Producers
0 Trying to compare or represent this " swill " as anything " Hitchcockian " is an out - n - out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to waste $ 7 on this movie ... Weak acting Weak story Weak script . < br /><br />No real suspense , no thrills . You wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff ... You're left thinking , what the heck was that all about.<br /><br />And please , enough with the movement to make " alternative lifestyles " HIP and politically correct!! ... I ca n't recommend this to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the acting is ? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and " Mork " . But those were MUCH more innocent times ...........
0 This movie is a mess . I 'm surprised it even has a theatrical release . WIthout Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video . It is poorly written . It is poorly directed . It 's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic . Especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it . Save your money . The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie 's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring .
0 Let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this . Normally I enjoy Robin Williams movies , however this gem was not one of them . It was billed as a suspenseful thriller . The night listener was anything but . To be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day , 2 walked out , for good reason . The movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed . The acting was alright but again there was n't anything to work with . The movie is about A storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid . However * insert spooky here * no one can verify the kids existence . So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author , however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker . There that s it , that s all . You wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends . It had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit . The homosexual undertones , or overtones had really nothing to do with the story , and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense . In conclusion i really ca n't write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it , it was as captivating as watching paint dry . I gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it was n't directed by Uwe Boll .
0 I would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.<br /><br />Why I did n't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie I can not say . I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately ! ! Several people in our theater did and sadly I did n't follow them out.<br /><br />The story lacked all criteria for a movie . NO plot . Awful acting ! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in . Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk . I did like the tazer scene . Too bad it did n't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot . Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film !
0 I usually come on this website prior to going to the movies , as I like to see what other people think of the movie . I read many reviews which said ' thriller not a horror movie ' . This prompted me to give this film a try . I really must take issue with these ' thriller / horror ' statements , as it was neither ! I almost went and asked for my money back , and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish .... well you must be easily pleased ! At the end of the movie , the people behind me said out loud " what a waste of time " and I turned to them and replied " I could n't have summed it up better " . I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it did n't . There was the potential for a lot of good scares ( or thrills if you like ) but none happened . Williams acted the part quite well but I felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere . Save your money folks , this is a turkey which will be featuring at a DVD store ' bargain box ' near you in the very foreseeable future !
0 This movie was n't awful but it was n't very good . I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress . The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid . The book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it . Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you do n't know if this kid really exists or if she 's making it all up . I am not gon na ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette 's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams . < br /><br />The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD .
0 Another chapter in the ongoing question , whatever happened to Mel Brooks 's sense of humor ? It starts out nicely enough , with Mel as Trump - like mogul Goddard Bolt ( " You can call me God " ) , who accepts a bet that he ca n't live on the streets for 30 days . But the moment the movie hits the streets , it turns into a pathos - laden mess , with occasional " funny " bits interjected ( Mel sees a black kid break - dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck - and - wing , yuk , yuk ) . Leslie Ann Warren is nothing short of wasted . The worst part is this movie 's musical number , in which Brooks and Warren do a silent dance to Cole Porter 's " Easy to Love . " Brooks 's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies ; here he plays the whole thing straight , like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on " The Carol Burnett Show " ( on which Rudy DeLuca , this film 's co - writer , began his career ) . Go rent Charlie Chaplin 's THE KID , which covered the same ground 70 years before and did a lot
0 Woody Allen made " September " , proving that even a genius could screw up . This is Mel Brook 's " September " . Monumentally stupid , boring , and unfunny , I must confess I did not watch it through to the end . The flick ranks among the dishonored few ( e.g. , " The Money Pit " , " Out to Sea " , " Spitfire Grill " ) which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the " rewind " button . And I say this , sadly , as a devoted Mel Brooks fan . He should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone . How the same fellow that made " Young Frankenstein " and " Spaceballs " could crank out a dog like this is beyond me . To be avoided at all costs .
0 Whenever I make up a list of the absolute worst movies I 've ever seen , this movie is always on it . It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing , and I would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again.<br /><br />What 's wrong with it ? Let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater.<br /><br />I went to a midnight show , on a Saturday night . I the only ones in the theater were myself , and a bunch of loud , boisterous , rather unruly teenagers , sitting somewhere behind me . They were obviously out having a good time on a Saturday night , and had come to this " comedy " for some laughs . Before the movie starts , during the previews , they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time . It was borderline annoying ; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie , I might 've said something , but I was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun , so I let it go . And they did settle down once the movie started.<br /><br />Why am I telling you all this ? Because you can judge this alleged " comedy " by the effect it had not just on myself , but on this rowdy bunch.<br /><br />During the entire run of the film , not one person in the theater laughed . Not once . Not myself , not the boisterous kids . Absolute silence , aside from the soundtrack . And when the film was over and the lights came on , we all , all of us , slowly filed out of the theater in slow , somber , absolute silence . It could 've been a funeral.<br /><br />This was the effect that this " comedy " produced . Not laughter , not enjoyment , but absolute DEPRESSION . It was a depressing , depressing movie , and not the tiniest bit funny . Preachy , self - indulgent , depressing , but not funny.<br /><br />I consider Mel Brooks ' " Blazing Saddles " to be on the short list for Funniest Movie Ever . It still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the Least Funny Movie Ever.<br /><br />In short : if you 're feeling too happy , give this movie a whirl ; otherwise , do n't say I did n't warn you .
0 I ca n't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness . Of course , Brooks has not made a comedy about _ real _ homeless people . No mention of drugs , prostitution or violence on these streets . The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they do n't eat quite as often . Brooks ' movies have become worse and worse over the years . This is just another nail in the coffin .
0 I have done quite a few reviews on IMDb and this film is unique in that I never saw the entire movie . It was so terribly stupid and unfunny that I just could n't sit through it -- though I tried.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie I call " the Mel quotient " . In other words , the better his movie , the less of him you see in the film . Think about it -- The Producers and Young Frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all . BUT , films like Life Stinks and Space Balls are chock full of Mel and are pretty dopey movies ( yes , I DID NOT LIKE Space Balls -- but this is n't the place to talk about that).<br /><br />Second , apart from cancer , rectal itch and mental retardation , I ca n't think of a less funny topic than homelessness . This is just a comedy breaker . Think about it , folks . The FUNNIEST ( ? ) scene in the movie has Mel making whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster ! ! And this is funny in what way ?
0 So there 's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there 's KEVIN , the world 's biggest wuss . Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive , bratty , and virginal girlfriend AMY . As he returns from work to ... a random house ... he finds his " friends , " the sexually confusing red - shorted KYLE and the truly revolting sluttish DAPHNE . They are soon joined by Daphne 's boyfriend , the trigger - happy sex - crazed macho lunkhead NICK . And there 's the title creatures , horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart 's desire . Kyle 's heart 's desire is to mate with a creepy , yucky woman in spandex . Nick 's heart 's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- I mean nightclub . Kevin 's heart 's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks . Amy 's heart 's desire is to be a disgusting slut . Daphne 's already a disgusting slut , so she does n't have a heart 's desire . Along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song . The hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up . " Citizen Kane " can not hold a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema .
0 No matter how you look at this movie , it is just awful.<br /><br />If you view it as a horror , then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.<br /><br />If you look at it as a comedy , then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.<br /><br />If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a B**ch!<br /><br />If you look at it as an action you ca n't really pull for the whiny hero.<br /><br />As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining . As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie . This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre . Critters looked pretty good , so did the Ghoulies , heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these . The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable . The hero is a whiney security guard , his girlfriend is always complaining , they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend , and another friend who is a spaz . At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes ... this movie is just utterly stupid . I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum ( which is obviously not a club , but more likely a diner ) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 . Give me a break , I am 25 and I look younger than any of them .
0 This rip off of the 1984 hit " Gremlins " is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made . Even for a ' B ' grade movie , all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot , acting , and goodness.<br /><br />It begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance . Why ? Because a few minutes into the film he walks into the ' forbidden ' safe , and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub.<br /><br />This is just an appetizer for the scat - filled main course . The main character , KEVIN , struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy . Perhaps he succeeds within the film , but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor . Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard , and is guided through his security shift in the ( wait for it ) abandoned studio lot . Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself . Back to the film . Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins . The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason . They must be returned before sunrise or else ... or else what ? Exactly.<br /><br />Other characters include Kevin 's ' macho ' army friend NICK , Nick 's ' woman ' DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitch - slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits . There is Kevin 's manipulative and ' reserved ' girlfriend AMY , whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher look - alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top .. Do n't ask me how that works . Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE . How such groups of friends are made is up for question . Kyle is a perverted creep who ca n't go an hour without self - stimulating . His hobbies include calling up sex - chat lines from other people 's houses and most likely sniffing underwear.<br /><br />The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins : knee - high creatures ( aka . hand puppets ) which , for some reason , attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood . Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars ... or the film having a big budget.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD : The twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering " What ? " . The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by ... their own free will . Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc , or perhaps the story - writers got writer 's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending . Upon returning to the safe , the old security guard reveals " What he learned in the military " and detonates explosives which destroys the safe , signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride ; better fitted to a ride on an escalator.<br /><br />The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears . If you plan to watch it , I recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind .
0 Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I begin?!?<br /><br />This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst film ever made . This one is fun to laugh at , where as Manos was just painful to watch . Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term : " 80 's cheeze " . The acting ( and I am using this term loosely ) is atrocious , the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see , and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed . The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3 K , and that version is the only way to watch this mess . This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one - liners they have ever done . If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots ..... God help you ! !
0 This movie is not just bad , not just corny , it is repulsive . Something about Daphne , about the creepy call - girl , about the whole damn ( and I use the word literally ) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress . This film makes my skin crawl , makes me regret having reproductive organs , and makes me feel unclean.<br /><br />One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept . A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results , rather than the cliché Worst Nightmare and the overdone Twisted Wish , is a truly fascinating film idea.<br /><br />Thought : The reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights . During the day , bright lights do n't show up well , so they could go anywhere.<br /><br />Count the Hobgoblins : Four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio , and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush - toys are killed throughout the course of the movie.<br /><br />Discussion Question : If you had a frigid , demanding , unappreciative girlfriend , would you enter garden - tool - combat with a military chunkhead ? Explain .
0 How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion . This film is absolutely criminal . Before watching this movie I thought Manos : Hands of Fate was the worse piece of crap I ever saw , but at least Manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep , thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer . The greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the Hobgoblins " locked " up makes it to the final scene . The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life .
0 There can be no questions of spoilers for this movie , the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways.<br /><br />A blatant rip - off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins , this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films . It ends up a sleazy waste of time , where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director , who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them . They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles , shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening . It 's painful to watch , and not helped by the mental 80 's fashions worn by the cast.<br /><br />Basically , some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement , and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds . The guards new recruit , the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings , gets his gang of 80 's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem ... Hobgoblins.<br /><br />All life is here , with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock , his 80 's slut girlfriend , the ' hero 's frigid and prissy girlfriend , and the young hero , lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway.<br /><br />First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene , where the ex - military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully , poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours . Then there 's some running around , terminating in a real pie - fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand - grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them . Then the film sorta ends , and alls well that ends well.<br /><br />It 's not . This is like watching a train wreck , you ca nt take your eyes off it , it 's so bad . Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater , but god - awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut . The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast , and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight . This scores 2 out of 10 at most , on a good day .
0 For starters , " Hobgoblins " tries to ape the more successful " Gremlins " . That 's bad enough but they do n't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here . Instead , it 's more like a bargain basement , everything - must - go clearance of embarrassing scenes , inappropriate sound FX , acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube - aroo.<br /><br />The plot ? Grrrr .... Meddling kids track down gremlin - like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies . Sound cool , does it ? Well , see that wall on the other side of your room ? Run right at it , top speed , face first . See , THAT is cooler than this movie.<br /><br />You dare to doubt ? Quick , name something else one of the leads has been in other than this . What other scripts have the writers done since " Hobgoblins " ? Name another Rick Sloane directoral effort . How many " Hobgoblins " action figures do you have ? See ? THANK you.<br /><br />I can not believe I took so long to write about such a horrible film . I 'd rather write about more important things ; like the separation of church and state , economic restructuring in Europe , that kind of thing . But no , " Hobgoblins " it is and it is bad - bad like your grandparents ' wallpaper , bad as pink flamingos on your lawn , bad like underwear that says " Home of the Whopper" ... and I think we 'll stop there.<br /><br />Well , Mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might , they can do only so much with " Hobgoblins " before they realize that , yes , the director DOES need kicked in the shin.<br /><br />Real , real hard.<br /><br />One star for " Hobgoblins " , seven stars for the MST3 K version .
0 Wow , I just finally managed , after several attempts , to finish watching this god awful movie , only to learn that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a straight - to - video sequel this year.<br /><br />Of all movies reviewed by MST3K -- and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel , screening the reputationally bad ' Manos , ' ' Werewolf , ' ' The Incredibly Strange , ' and the lesser know disasters like ' Laserblast , ' ' Zombie Nightmare , ' and ' Time Chasers,'--this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they 'd ever shown ( which makes it perfect for riffing ) . Very simple , the movie is about a bunch of Munchies - like gremlins on the loose , exploiting people 's desires for fame , fortune , prowess , and of course , sex in ways that end up with people getting killed . But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous ( a test of machismo , for example , is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools ) , the writing is so forced ( such as the oft - described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it , if only she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is n't the first time in the movie this happens ) , and the story is so ... rarely given attention ( hence the MST3 K riff about a " law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers ) , that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen . Worst movie ... ever .
0 * * * * MINOR SPOILERS * * * As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet " Hobgoblins " stands apart from all others in it 's own unique way . Classic baddies such as " The Creeping Terror , " " The Mighty Gorga " and " Manos " are uniformly bad from start to finish . " Hobgoblins " on the other hand , starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes . During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film . I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer . The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept " Club Scum " sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another . With just this one film , director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time . How bad can a bad movie be ? Watch " Hobgoblins " and wonder no longer .
0 Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3 K version , you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production . The filmmakers insult the viewer 's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously could n't care less that they are doing so.<br /><br />Everything about it is rock - bottom cheap . Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.<br /><br />The " hobgoblins " are , as you probably know , " realized " with badly - crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys ; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them , it 's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body . When the critters scurry away from the two security guards , this is shown ( or rather , not shown ) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past . It 's reminiscent of the scene in the film " Tangents " where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world , surveying the wreckage , and we are n't shown any of it . Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you wo n't have anything worth showing , so why try ? The " sets " were utterly laughable . " Club Scum " was an obvious diner ; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot . The " spacecraft " is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model - making 10 year - old.<br /><br />The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he has n't made her " proud of him . " I 'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end , but any guy with real self - respect would have told her to go to hell and left her . Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training ( yeah , nice regulation haircut , Nick , ) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic , moronic animals who are sex maniacs . Kyle is a phone - sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex - clad dominatrix type , but he 's so effeminate that he 's more likely gay than not . One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.<br /><br />And the hobgoblins ? At the end they all head back to the vault where they 've lived for 30 years . Why ? Who knows ? Who cares ? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film - making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script , incompetent direction , actors who are so bad they 'd be rejected from a high school theater production , and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood , Jr.
0 If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins , then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies . These barely - animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies ( which involve basically groteque characters ' sex dreams - oh joy ) , but what that has to do with anything is anybody 's guess , except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica . They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell , one suspects . There 's no real plot - just " goblins - kill ! " and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience .
0 Hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done Gremlins rip - off . That 's the best thing one can say about this stinkpile . Pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability . It was very painful to watch.<br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs .
0 I really do n't have anything new to add but I just felt like I had to comment on this sack . So here goes:<br /><br />Atrocious . I 'm running through my MST3 K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time . It 's really , really painful but it was next on the list ... You can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is " Hobgoblins " but it just could n't get out . Everything about this movie is 4th rate . The story , the acting , the effects , the women , the " action scenes " , the ... ahhhh forget it . I can watch a piece of crap like " The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z " ( aka " Zaat " ) over and over and over with hardly any ill effects ( I like it in fact- btw , it will be on TCM later this month- October , 2009 ) but " Hobgoblins " is a whole ' nother ballgame.<br /><br />The worst part of it all may be that it 's now about 12 hours after the movie ended , I had a good night 's sleep , some coffee and some dry toast , my medications , and yet the ersatz " New Wave " dance music that Amy , Red Shorts , and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD . This torment will last for days . < br /><br />Good luck , wo n't you ?
0 This movie is so bad , it 's comical . In fact , Mystery Science Theatre 3000 , the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies , used this very film to mock . I suggest watching it ( maybe on YouTube ) instead of actually seeing this movie.<br /><br />Please , do not see Hobgoblins if you 're not prepared to stop within the first scene . Actually , do not see this movie , period . Please . At least not seriously . Its jokes are not funny ( to say the least ) , and you 'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie.<br /><br />You may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching , so spare yourself . Read a book . Do the laundry . Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins .

Apparently , garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used , not just in fights ( tell me I 'm not the only one who noticed this).<br /><br />The simply truth is this film just came out wrong . Period . There is n't much meat on the bone , nor does it do anything really well . Even average . It 's just bad . However , I 've seen far worse , and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold , intentional or otherwise.<br /><br />2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse then this . At least the film never took itself seriously .
0 A group of extremely unlikable A - holes are tormented by lame puppets that some elderly douche bag night - watchman has kept locked away in a film vault for twenty years for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />Many people know this film merely from MST3 K 's spot - on ribbing of the flick . But I 've seen the actual movie and can safely say that yes it 's bad , really , REALLY bad . From the one of the most awful ' fight ' scenes I 've ever witnessed to the stuffed toy ' aliens ' that suffer from a lack of motion ( I had a My Pet Monster that was scarier ) right up to the atrocious acting ( I had a My Pet Monster that was more charismatic ) However , that being said Rick Sloan 's " Vice Academy " films are somehow , and trust me I have no earthly idea how , much worse . That 's not to suggest that this film is anything but crap , because it is n't . Just throwing it out there.<br /><br />Eye Candy : no nudity in the movie proper , but there 's 2 pairs of tits in the DVD Introduction to the film < br /><br />My Grade : D- < br /><br />Retromedia DVD Extras : Introduction by Jim Wynorski ; Stills gallery ; and Trailer for this film
0 I once thought that " The Stoned Age " was the worst film ever made ... I was wrong . " Hobgoblins " surpassed it in every way I could imagine and a few I could n't . In " The Stoned Age " I hated the characters . In " Hobgoblins " I hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity . I wo n't include a teaser to this film , I 'm not that cruel . I could n't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment . In fact , any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning . Words I would use to describe this film are as follows : insipid , asinine , and ingenuous.<br /><br />In conclusion , PLEASE do n't watch this film . I beg of you , from one movie lover to another ... no , from one human being to another , PLEASE . For the sake of your own sanity and intellect DO NOT WATCH IT . Destroy any copies you come across .
0 Description : Corny , utterly stupid and worthless . It 's so cheap and lame , it 'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget ( I 'm guessing this ... ) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie . It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater . I am giving you the best advice in the world:<br /><br />Spare yourself , spare your time , life , and money , by NOT -- I repeat , NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie . This movie is so corny , it 'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom . If you have a one - digit IQ , then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie . You might actually admire it . ( Like I said before , IF you have a one - digit IQ)<br /><br />With about 12 actors of your own , a few puppets you bought at a garage sale , and of course cameras and music , I gaurentee you 'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap .
0 this is the result . A piece of trash movie that does n't deserve to even be classified as a movie , it 's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel , that makes no sense whatsoever . Well back to the actors , which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film . Well it 's a great horror anyway , nevermind being a film . There 's plenty of horrific acting in " Hobgoblins , " but the worse is the main guy named Richard , who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for . Well , when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary , on a less than shoestring budget , no less , this is what will happen . Oh well at least the MST3 K version was hilarious . But this is still a horrid movie , that deserves all the bashing it gets . 9 for the MST version .
0 ... Bad at being intentionally bad ... <br /><br />This little gem shot straight onto the MST3k big screen . While it 's obvious the movie is n't trying to be taken seriously ( Hopefully that their goal , anyway ... ) , the movie is still plain bad . Hell , it makes Leprechaun In Space look big budgeted ... <br /><br />In short : Paint my muscle car prune colored !
0 Good Lord , what were they THINKING ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! Here is your spoiler warning , even though I do n't think it 'll really matter . You wo n't be seeing this piece of trash anyway.<br /><br />A group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people , who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them , and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies . In other words , the whole thing is really stupid.<br /><br />You KNOW it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots ca n't save something ! ! And they did n't ! I know , some of their lines were funny , like what to add to the sign " HIT " and the hand comments , but , geez , this was pretty dang sad.<br /><br />All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE O CRUD . IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR EYES .
0 Good grief ! While I still maintain that Manos : The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available , Hobgoblins came awfully close . This ... this ... thing insults the audience at every opportunity.<br /><br />At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k , this one was a struggle to get through . I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish . This thing managed to embarrass me - alone!<br /><br />Even if you are a die - hard MST3 K fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment , think twice about seeing this one.<br /><br />It 's that bad .
0 Hee hee hee . This movie is so bad that it does n't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time . I remember the day I first saw this on MST . Sun was shining , looked like a good day . then , I saw this product of Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land . Kevin , wussy extraordinaire , tries to impress his girlfriend , manages an assistant security guard job , fights with rakes , and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images . No plot or story is needed . Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves . An army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff , and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say , " He has got some nice red shorts " . Plus , I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart . Just when you think it 's over , wait until the Club Scum scene . Ask for Road Rash.<br /><br />I advise that after viewing this film , a good month to regain senses and sanity . And if you see Rick Sloane , give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins .
0 My favorite quote from Crow was , when the car was going off the cliff , " The movie is so bad , even the car wants to get out of it!" < br /><br />This had to be the funniest movie I have ever seen . It was seriously out there to scare you , which makes it even funnier ! If it were n't for Mystery Science Theater I would n't be here today ! :-P
0 I did n't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts .... really awful . The fact that it does n't take itself seriously ( usually a good thing ) works against it , primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards . On the upshot though ..... the MST3 K version , as always , has a few laughs ....
0 Hobgoblins ... what a concept . Rick Sloan was a master with this film . He had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that could n't act . On top of that , he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong . Put it together , you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners . This movie was very painful . The pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your genitals carved out with a spoon , and then having the entire wound covered with salt and Hydrochloric acid .
0 This movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself . I think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage . The main characters are the whiny non - hero Kevin , Amy , his bratty , ungodly conservative girlfriend , Kyle , a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex , Daphne , a scrawny , horny girl who is supposed to be " cool " and has no sense of how to dress , and her oversexed boyfriend Nick , an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything . No , I 'm not a pervert , that 's REALLY how the movie goes . The movie itself is an over - sexed rip - off of 1986 's Gremlins , only you 'll never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere . No , these Hobgoblins , unleashed by Wimpy Man ( I 'm sorry , Kevin ) , make someone 's wildest dreams come true , and then kill the victims . Yes , you guessed it - Eventually , they wind up in a strip club , where the nerdy Amy 's greatest dream is revealed - She wants to be a stripper ! Look , I watched this flick via MST3 K , and even with Mike Nelson , Tom Servo , and Crow T. Robot making a laughing - stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes . Not really , but I wish I had . I 'm not giving you anymore plot , because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain . Besides , it 's not like there 's a plot worth mentioning . They should put a Surgeon 's General Warning on this film .
0 Yep .. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies , but I have definately seen worse . Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway , I met Rick Sloane at some sci - fi convention , that amazingly , he was lecturing at ! It was one of those really low budget conventions , where everything goes , an everyone brought in something ( if you want to see crap , you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in).<br /><br />He seemed like a very nice guy , he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins , and he even told me not to take it seriously , and said he loved the MST3 K version!<br /><br />All in all , Rick Sloane knew what he was doing . And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks . So I guess I 'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 , and betraying all my fellow MSTies . Sorry guys .
0 Even for the cocaine laced 1980 's this is a pathetic . I do n't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid , time , effort , money , and audience brain cells to make such drivel . If your going to make a comedy , make it funny . If you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself . If you 're going to release it as a joke like this : DON'T ! ! ! I mean , it was a joke right ? Someone please tell me this was a joke . please .
0 The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co - stars in this movie . She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role . I do n't consider it a supporting role either , but rather a " bit " part . Also the plot has many unexplained elements . Some examples are : why does the main character reject her oldest son ? Why does her youngest son drive head on into the train ? He says its for a " sucker " bet which does n't explain anything . Obviously the screenwriter does n't know the definition of a sucker bet . This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion . Save your money and view it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen .
0 Margret Laurence probably did n't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film , let alone the Stone Angel . Hagar , as a character , was one who constantly challenged the social norm ( Gainsay who dare , anyone ? ) , and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process . The symbols in the book ( the Stone Angel , Silver Thread , etc , etc . ) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new , and the carnage ( so to speak ) along the way.<br /><br />While the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book ( but it is n't really a plot kind - of storytelling , is it ? ) , I think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film . Hagar 's defiance ( for the sake of defiance ) was not there . Bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed , and Hagar 's father could have been played more " traditionally " , so to speak . If the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals , the film would drive the point straight to home.<br /><br />Along the same vein , why should we see cell phones , organic produce , and other modernizations ? Are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points ( e.g. , the Muslim girlfriend and the Native people ) . Hagar and co. are everything but politically correct in the book , so why should we see that in the film version . Modernization may be an excuse for a low - budget operation , but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically - correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel ( and the film ) seems like throwing punches below the intellect.<br /><br />There is also the audience . It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable . Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums ? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at , or with , Hagar . These people are frustrated and are full of angst , and all we do is to laugh at them . I do n't think it did Hagar and other folks in her situation any justice .
0 Two sisters , their perverted brother , and their cousin have car trouble . They then happen about the home of Dr. Hackenstein whom conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life . He tells them that he 'll help them get home in the morning , so they spend the night . Then the good doctor gets down to work in this low - budget horror - comedy.<br /><br />I found this to be mildly amusing , nothing at all to actually go out of your way for ( I stumbled across it on Netflix instant view & streamed it to the xbox 360 ) , but better then I expected it to be for a Troma acquired film . Most of the humor does n't work , but their are still some parts that caused me to smile . Plus the late , great Anne Ramsey has a small part and she was always a treat to watch.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Bambi Darro & Sylvia Lee Baker got topless < br /><br />My Grade : D+
0 Dr. Hackenstein begins at the turn of last century , ' 1909 The dawn of modern medical science ' to be exact . Dr. Eliot Hackenstein ( David Muir ) is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments , Dr. Hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life ... It 's now ' Three years later ' & Dean Slesinger ( Micheal Ensign ) is round the Doc 's house for dinner . As Dean Slesinger & Dr. Hackenstein eat they talk about Hackenstien 's experiments which Dean Slesinger has always been opposed to , Dr. Hackenstein shows Dean Slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife Sheila ( Sylvia Lee Baker ) who died in an unfortunate ' accident ' & can telepathically talk to him ( Christy Botkin provides Sheila 's voice apparently ) . Dr. Hackenstein also show 's Dean Slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage & explains that with the process he has developed he will bring Sheila back to life . The Dean has some sort of seizure & apparently dies . Meanwhile sisters Wendy ( Bambi Darro as Dyanne DiRossario ) & Leslie Trilling ( Catherine Davis Cox ) plus their Brother Alex ( John Alexis ) & their cousin Melanie Victor ( Stacey Travis ) are driving along near Hackenstein 's house when they crash , they seek shelter & assistance & arrive upon Hackenstein 's doorstep . Dr. Hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night . Later on Dr. Hackenstein is visited by two grave - robbers , Xavier ( Logan Ramsey ) & Ruby Rhodes ( Ann Ramsey ) who deliver a male body when Hackenstein actually needs female parts for Sheila . Dr. Hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available & starts to ' borrow ' the bits ' n ' pieces he needs to complete Sheila ... <br /><br />Written & directed by Richard Clark I was pleasantly surprised by Dr. Hackenstein , I 'll state right now that it ai n't brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was I actually quite liked it . It moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it 's middle as things settle down . The script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when Dr. Hackenstein is trying to restrain Melanie & she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper Yolanda Simpson ( Catherine Cahn ) by kicking out & Hackenstein keeping Melanie behind Yolanda 's back who is seemingly oblivious to what 's happening , with a touch of gore but I 'd say Dr. Hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception & feel throughout . There are some tacky puns & sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh , Dr. Hackenstein to Wendy " would you like to see my instruments " as an example . I also thought the scene when Mrs Trilling ( Phyllis Diller ) reports her missing daughter 's to the bemused detective Olin ( William Schreiner ) was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle 's talking about why he is n't looking for them even though he has only just been told , why the cell does n't have a prisoner in it & that if he did n't find the cousin not to worry about it . None of it 's flat laugh - out - loud but I must admit I found myself smiling on occasion & found the film as whole to be quietly amusing . There is n't a lot of on screen gore , a few severed limbs , Sheila 's decapitated head , some medical stitching & those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way . I liked the characters in Dr. Hackenstein too , which was surprise in itself . The acting is n't brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it , lots of exaggerated facial movements & some serious overacting means it 's never dull , oh & the three birds in Dr. Hackenstein are fit if you know what I mean . Technically the film is OK as well , once again it ai n't going to win any Oscars but I have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting . It does n't always work , the clothes are at odds with each other at times , the girls look like their from Victorian England while the guys look like their from a western . The house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room & stick a few candles in there ! It comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really is n't a bad looking film at all considering . Could have done without the comedy music though . Overall I ended up enjoying Dr. Hackenstein much more than I thought I would , although that in itself is n't a recommendation . It 's certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made & it certainly is not the worst either . A watchable enough piece of harmless fun .
0 Hated it . If you believe that everyone in the South is dumb , morally bankrupt , stupid , violent , a religious nut , or a child molester , then this film may be for you . Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant . In one scene , two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes . The man seemed proud of his actions , and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life . Very nice . A teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her -- despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water ( no backpack , etc . ) . Strathairn 's character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy , but he is shown to be a religious believer who ( typical for Hollywood ) reflects the vile nature of Christians . A scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear ( the one with DeNiro ) -- Bible verses being spouted by the bad guy . I am from the Great Northwest , but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC , WV , AL , MS , KY , TN , etc .
0 I saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon . It was playing on the family programming channel of HBO . At first I was drawn in , by what I thought was a Disney animation . But then , after a few minutes , I found myself searching for the remote , so I could find the ' INFO BUTTON ' , to find out what in the world was on my TV . I have nothing against Harvey F. , I enjoy him in many of his films , but one thing he is not , is a voice - over artist . Sure he has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood , but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package . Attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult . As for the rest of the cast , uninspired . I suppose working on this film did n't appeal to the really good voice over talent out there.<br /><br />So , weak voice talent , strong animation ... who was this film targeting ? Gay adolescent ducks ? I do n't get it . Is there really such a dearth of role - models for young up and coming homosexuals , that we must resort to animated ducks ? Cute story , and like the title , this movie I found hard to love , just like an ugly duckling .
0 I 've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because I have a baby girl who likes to watch TV . I began to watch this movie to see if I would like my little one to watch it ... and no . At the beginning I thought it was such a cute movie like the Bambi movie , but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual . The info said that they were making fun of him because he was n't good at sports , but that was not the case . It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay . It was also very sad , as far as the ducky 's dad and all . I do n't know , I guess if you 're gay you 'd like it , but I do n't think I 'm going to watch it again with my little one .
0 Unfortunately for me , the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was " 42nd Street . " I then expected all of his stuff to be that good . I found out that was n't necessarily the case , even here , with my all - time favorite classic - era actor James Cagney.<br /><br />Oh , the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always , but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome . They seem to always involve screaming , unhappy show producers . In this film , it 's Cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thin .... fast!<br /><br />Even the songs in here are anywhere near " 42nd Street " class , songs you could hum for years and years - decades , I should say . The songs in this movie are not memorable . No , this is one of the few early Cagney films - and Berkeley films - I totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching .
0 Usually , I know after the first minute of a movie if I will hate it or adore it ... but now , I was wrong.<br /><br />The start was great ; the " this is based on a true story " and blah blah blah thing was funny . After , the cartoons and the description of the guys ' life with pictures made me think I had made the right choice.<br /><br />Then , seeing the hilarious fake look of Toronto was cool . Also , the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea.<br /><br />That was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which afterwards looked like an eternity.<br /><br />Maybe that 's just me not understanding English Canadian humour ( that 's possible , English Canadians also do not always understand Quebecois humour ) , but hey ... there was enough stuff in that for a short movie , * nothing * more . Maybe that could be a meaning for the title ? Anyway , almost everything was filling , and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion.<br /><br />As a matter of fact , the " making of " was better than the movie . At least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad . The potential of the idea was great ; that 's why I rented the movie , being interested in the " annoying people disappearance " thing . But yet , I did not know the whole universe would vanish , and with it even a point to the movie.<br /><br />If you are English Canadian , it seems you could appreciate the local humour , considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8 . Otherwise , just think twice before losing your precious time ...
0 I honestly had somewhat high expectations when I first began to watch this movie , but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films I have ever seen!<br /><br />First of all , the pace is incredibly slow , so it seems much longer than it is ( and it 's not short).I'm sure when Jane Austen wrote the book , she made it several pages long , filled it with description , and did n't intend for people to read in in one day , or it might drag and lose it 's appeal , which " Emma " most certainly did . Now " Sense and Sensibility " had this flaw of a slow pace , but at least it had lively lines to make up for it , as well as some good performances!<br /><br />That brings me to flaw # 2 , which is of course , the acting . While I do n't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film , I am sure they are capable of good work , but I did n't see much of it in this movie . It was like people were trying too hard to be witty , too hard to be " upper - class " , too hard to be British ( well , some of them ) , so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.<br /><br />#3 . The cast , as I said , seemed only like actors , and not actually like the people they were playing . Maybe that 's a good thing , because the people they played really were n't all that nice . Why did everybody like Emma , for example ? Sure , she was nice to the rich , handsome people in front of them , but she was an awful gossip behind their backs . If her friends were " ugly " , then she did n't even bother to go behind their backs . So , why is this girl so great ? Why do people have to tell stories , " just to make her laugh ? " Of course the snob could n't even do that right . I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow , and her " Emma " did not exactly change my opinion.<br /><br />Well , it 's easy to see that I did not care for this one . I 'm sure it 's a lovely book and all , but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen , and " Emma " is one of them .
0 I was surprised when I saw this film . I 'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel . How disappointed I was.<br /><br />How any true Jane Austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes . The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times , but also ruin the feel of the period . As for the cast : Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine ( but then any ' hot ' American star would be questionable in the role ) , Toni Collette is miscast , and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable!<br /><br />I really could not say a good thing about this film . I seem to be among the very few who do n't rate it , but if you want my advice , see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me , that is far preferable to this superficial trash .
0 How good is Gwyneth Paltrow ! This is the right movie for her ... too bad she 's completely out role . I have n't read the book by Jane Austen , but I ca n't believe it is so superficial and the characters are n't much more than caricatures . It was n't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book , but I had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups . I was taking a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who did n't overstep the mark of overacting ( a couple of times ) .
0 i like Jane Austin novels . I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies , and I 'm half way through Mansfield Park . But i could n't stand Emma . I gave up on the book after 2 chapters , and by the end of the movie i could n't care less about Emma . She did n't seem to change at all . Maybe it was Paltrows acting ( which as excellent in Se7en ) or my lack of interest for the movie . Dunno . < br /><br />The costumes are nice , but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is bloody gorgeous , and although it as a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor , i liked his singing .
0 This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I ever saw outside of Star Wars . Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan but I still ca n't bring myself to forgive this movie 's existence.<br /><br />My sister has always been a huge Jane Austen fan and because of that , I have been subjected to various of the classics , Emma being one of them . I 've always considered them irritating , stupid and boring . However , after watching this terrible rendition , I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming . Ewan McGregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of Frank Churchill . Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid.<br /><br />My recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in English period drama ... go see the originals . If you 're a Ewan McGregor fan ... believe me , by skipping this film , you have n't missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut .
0 Bah . Another tired , desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.<br /><br />On the plus side , Toni Collette is superb as always ( being an actual actress , you see ) , and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes . There are even a few genuinely funny lines , and the filmwork , score and editing is competent , apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.<br /><br />But , ah , but . Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot , and they are almost all very clearly too old ( and in one case too young ) for their declared ages . Worse , they are all speaking " Austinese " , that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that could n't be further from the way people actually spoke in Austen 's day ( think Yosemite Sam , I kid you not ) . This is particularly sad , considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial " Fakespearan " that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.<br /><br />And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow . She 's only ever played one character in her films , and she stays true to form here , running through her entire range ( smirking to sulking ) in the first ten minutes , then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film . There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers , nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.<br /><br />In short , there is very little reason to watch Emma . It 's an amiable enough adaptation , but if you 're going to pack a film full of anacronisms ( i.e. an appalingly thin lead who ca n't shoot a bow or handle a period accent ) then you might as well do it properly , as with the vastly superior " Clueless " .
0 Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself baffled . How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite Jane Austen novel ? There are many problems with the film , already mentioned in a few reviews ; simply put it is a hammed - up , over - acted , chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending.<br /><br />While many characters are mis - cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them , the worst by far is Paltrow . I have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles , but here she is abominable - she is self - conscious , nasal , slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her . An extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this film .
0 How can anybody say that this movie is a comedy ? ? If I had not gone with then my finacee I would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back . I love Gwen Paltrow , but it was like she was on the wrong set . I like most chick flicks , but I hated this one . This is the only time I saw so much clevage and was not turned on . Those outfits were way overdone . No one talks that way anymore and I do n't think they even did then . The dancing part was horrible . My ex said to me later ... "Didn't ya like that part ? Did n't ya think it was sensous ? " I said yes only to spare her feelings . Now I know why we never married . This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
0 ... but I regret having seen it . Since the ratings on IMDb are relatively high ( and they must also have been relatively high on Netflix ) , I guess I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK , a category that has produced many films I liked immensely . " Saving Grace , " on the other hand , falls into the category of laugh - less comedies usually populated by Hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless . Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress , and I have liked her in other movies . The concept -- a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband 's death -- does not offend me . Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor , the film falls flat on its face ( falling flat on its arse might have been funnier ) as far as I and my wife were concerned . Be forewarned , oh gentle reader , not all offbeat British comedies succeed . This one is a dud .
0 Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the ' How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes ' award . Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana , a certain amount of silliness will ensue . However , the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny . It is a real shame , because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998 's Waking Ned Devine , which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.<br /><br />The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle - aged , recently widowed Grace Trevethyn , whose husband 's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money . Helped by her gardener , Matthew , she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana . Unfortunately , this leads her into confrontation with the local police , her husband 's creditors and a French drug baron . . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously . The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well - portrayed , and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through.<br /><br />The casting of the minor roles is excellent , even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric . However , the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace 's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all . And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing ? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants .
0 Like too many recent British films , this one takes a great cast and gives them a flimsy , cliched script to work with . The performances save it from total disgrace , and it has some charm but it certainly did n't make me laugh . Where are all the great British writers hiding ?
0 The plot , character development , and gags in this movie are all extremely weak . Quite a waste of time . The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles . There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible . The drug gags are cliched and much of the movie does n't ring true to life . The plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters are n't developed enough to care . Then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time .
0 When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality . And when it comes to acting , camera work , lighting etc ; this film does the business . It 's done by highly skilled craftsmen . That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours . But when you look under the layers of professionalism , you do n't really find anything . Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view , there 's really nothing there . The script is mediocre , the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood . In all it 's English cosiness , it 's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another " Full Monty " . Why they made this film ? I have n't got a clue , apart from making money of course .
0 My comments may be a bit of a spoiler , for what it 's worth . Stop now if you care enough .... <br /><br />Saving Grace should have been titled " A Paper - Thin Excuse for Old British Women to Get High On - Screen . " This film is dumb . The incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious , hackneyed tunes that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative ( " Spirit in the Sky , " for example - Oh , I get it ! ) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie made credible by its stodgy English setting and Brenda Blethyn 's overwhelming power to inflict emotion on an audience using her voice alone . I could literally hear the folks over at High Times magazine receiving their jollies over the enormous " buds " that litter this picture . Worst scene ? Easy . Brenda attempts to peddle her illicit wares on the street of London in a blaring white dress - suit . Not funny . Not original . Not interesting . Not a good movie . The 7.2 rating is the result of zealots over - voting . Do n't waste your time ...
0 A very " straight " nice old lady , desperate for money to save her house and possessions , grows " pot " in her house , smokes it with a few old - biddy friends and then sells it . That 's the story for this low - key comedy , emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings . For much of the film , it works . The humor is n't of the laugh - out - loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour - and - a- half , so I guess it serves its purpose.<br /><br />There ARE funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role . But the ending really ruined a " cute " movie with insultingly - bad messages that only the ultra - liberals of the film world would like to see happen.<br /><br />Like most people , I would prefer a happy ending , too , but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law . Also in here are the typical ( 1 ) children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay ; ( 2 ) clerics portrayed as morally weak people ; and ( 3 ) even a medical doctor who gets stoned , too ! < br /><br />Hello ? And reviewers here blast Hollywood ? This is exhibit A how a secular society has lowered the standards in the UK and Europe in general . Hey , people : at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a Timothy Leary " If it feels good , do it " message .
0 I absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film . The humor seems to be destined for corpses . It 's slow . The story is too simple to be true . The characters do not raise much sympathy , a few non - important characters aside . Nothing surprising happens . What did the writers of this script think ? " Oooo funny ! Let 's make some old lady 's high on pot ! Let 's make them .... giggle ! Let 's make them ... behave like little children ! ! Oooo , yes , that 's absolutely brilliant and original!" < br /><br />This film has irritated me most from all the films I 've seen in the last five years .
0 Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja - growing in order to pay the bills . It sounds promising and the ever - reliable Brenda Blethyn does n't disappoint but the material is sitcom - thin . There 's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to " Give me one " ( a toke ) and he thinks she 's asking for sex and acts all awkward . Yes , it 's humour so twee a nun would be bored . Saving Grace does n't seem to know what it wants to be : the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryan 's Daughter whilst the light - hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow . It does speed up after the first hour but by then it 's too clichéd to care . The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I 've ever seen .
0 It feels like swedish movies are trying to become more american and I just don´t get it . In this movie the performance of some of the actors is horrible and the script is nothing special . Don´t waste your time !
0 Swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate American hardened action movies like " Heat " but with a low budget . This movie follows the same prescription as " Noll Tolerans " and " Livvakterna " . However , it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie.<br /><br />The story has been seen before , the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor , especially from the main actress . The movie tries to paint a picture of hard - boiled military - like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational . It does not succeed very well.<br /><br />The bluish - cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore , and it is not even done well in this picture . Only a very few scenes actually look good . Also , the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward.<br /><br />The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk , though not making a convincing portrait of a SWAT - team leader , has some really funny lines . Also , the music is quite well .
0 Standard procedure for Swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process . Rånarna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense.<br /><br />Banks in Stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient " military - styled " gang of robbers . Two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first.<br /><br />As usual in Swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again . Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film from the last few years ! But that 's OK i guess since Persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here ( like he usually does ) . The problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself . First of all the robberies feel mostly like background . Rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world ( like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin ) . Also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as Aliens landing . But still , i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then . It spiced things up a bit ( and actually saved the rating from dropping another step).<br /><br />In the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other Swedish movies of this kind . Simply that the action and suspense does n't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind ( mostly Hollywood ) . It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison . In my opinion Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting , and forget about trying to make " Hollywood - action light " like they do now . Because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the Swedish movie - industry . I rate it 3/10 .
0 Quite typical for swedish movies of this type . Strange that the acting was soooo bad , these actors usually give a good show . The casting was poorly done , it made you expect something ( I wo n't tell you what ) . The lead character was awful ... I do n't know where they find her . Anyway , stay away from this and go see " Den Tredje Vågen " instead , this is swedish action in is prime .
0 This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I was actually expecting a bad movie but I was caught by surprise believe it or not . The storyline is the traditional , all clichées are included.<br /><br />The dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half - descent actors are trying to make it sound real . The photo is not too good , the music is so malplacée it actually made me angry , the actors are not even trying , altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the " action " itself.<br /><br />I do nt understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming , who is financing this shit ? Where is the screening ? And why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script?<br /><br />There are a million hollywood - movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters , but even them Straight To Video things actually manages to look professional in comparison.<br /><br />I can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all , I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life .
0 When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script , I was like , " alright , I 'll give it a chance , it 's not going to be better than the first , but we 'll see what happens . " Well , I saw what happened . I saw a great late 70's/80 's show that was a classic , basically humiliated by Hollywood . It 's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters can not come up with something original these days . They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience , and try to " REMAKE " the classic show . HEADS UP Hollywood ... IT AIN'T WORKIN ! ! ! ! Anyway , more about the show . I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott ( Stiffler from American Pie ) to play Bo . I 'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of . Also , Get for real , Johnny Knoxville , as Luke Duke . How low can you go ? ? A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke . This sickens me . Also , I 'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman , but her acting sucks . Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy , was smart , sexy , strong , opinionated and a good IL ' southern girl . She was every little girls role model growing up ! ( I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you very much ! ! ! ) Anyway , Jessica Simpson played a smart ass , 2-bit slut as Daisy Duke . Daisy never was blonde . Why did they have to cast her . Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke . She can speak with a great southern accent , and she is gorgeous , and would have done a wonderful job . Anyway , I 'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce . I feel like I got ripped off by paying $ 8.50 for tickets , and they should refund my money . If you like the Dukes of Hazzard ( the original series ) do n't see this movie . It 'll just upset you . CMT ( country music television ) plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night . So set your TIVO 's and go with the real thing , not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood .
0 Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it ? They ask why Hollywood is n't making the money it used to . Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage . The TV show was what it was , good people in bad situations where the good IL ' boys come out on top . It was n't Gone with the Wind but it was fun . This movie is garbage ! Hollywood ca n't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $ $ $ $ . I only hope that this movie makes 10x 's less than it cost to make . The only one 's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee . The audience is the victim.<br /><br />Don't see it , watch the reruns of the TV show instead . They still hold up 20 years later .
0 Film makeovers of old TV shows seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days , but this disrespectful , toilet humor , do - you - kiss - your - mother - with - that - mouth foul language , rip - off is a blatant middle finger to all Dukes of Hazzard fans both north and south of the Mason - Dixon Line . From the opening sequence of Bo and Luke Duke making a moonshine run for Uncle Jesse ( no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation ) to the closing sequence of Uncle Jesse smoking weed with the Governor of Georgia ( Uncle Jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways ) this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult . I ca n't tell you how many parents I saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived . The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a family show with basic moral values . The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a kid safe , Hemi powered , show of fun that parents did n't have to worry about teaching their kids George Carlin 's seven words . I have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist . Those commits might be correct about the movie . Those commits are ABSOLUTELY incorrect about the show . The show , if anything , was about how to get along and be friends with ANYONE . Hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us , Yankee , Rebel , or otherwise , who still believe in honor , loyalty , trust , family , and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing . Hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid , uneducated , beer swilling , foul mouthed , trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell . Prove the Hollywood Elitist that they are wrong . DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE . Boycott the sponsors . Fill Warner Bros. email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we do n't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest T.V. shows of all time . Save your money and buy the DVD 's of the original show , but whatever you do   DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE
0 ... then you 'd better not watch this movie . They 've completely ruined the premise of the show . In the movie the Duke boys are idiots , Daisy is trampy , Roscoe is sinister , Boss Hogg is capable , Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters . At least Enos is kinda close.<br /><br />At one point they open the doors to get into the General Lee -- nuff said.<br /><br />The original show may not have been great TV , but it was entertaining and the characters made sense . This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets the Simple Life .
0 In Hazzard County , Georgia , cousins Bo and Luke Duke ( Scott , Knoxville ) and their cousin Daisy Duke ( Jessica Simpson ) run moonshine made by their Uncle Jesse ( Willie Nelson ) while avoiding the local authority , Boss Hog ( Burt Reynolds ) . Their problems with the Boss are only beginning as they learn he 's been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it.<br /><br />I have never seen the TV show and after watching the movie , I 'm not going to start any time soon . I like stupid comedies but this one did n't offer many laughs . It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through . The second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity . The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much . The characters in general were n't very interesting and the actors portraying them did n't do a very good job.<br /><br />The acting was n't very good . I was n't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny . Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances . The latter was pretty good as Stifler but he tries way too hard here . The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else . Jessica Simpson is n't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing . She 's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things . She is pretty but she 's a weak actor . It does n't matter though because she does n't really appear in the movie and the character she plays is n't complex or anything . Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he does n't do anything special.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by John O'Brien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard . The first one was Cradle to the Grave , which was okay . The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny . He does n't do a good job here though as the story is a mess . He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better . The movie is also pretty long for a comedy . Okay , 106 minutes is n't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there 's very little humor in the first hour . I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time . The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes . The car sequences were average and they do n't save an already troubled film . In the end , Dukes of Hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it 's better if you just skip it . Rating 4/10
0 What a snore - fest.<br /><br />Of all the bits of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to remake and update , this is by far one of the most pointless . This was a totally pointless show in the first place , and we REALLY do n't need a ' modern ' update.<br /><br />Never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning , so many advances have been made , socially , since the show ran that the entire point of the show ( if it ever had one ) has been lost.<br /><br />Also , what is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he 's NOT overweight ?
0 For this review , a list of good points and bad points . I'll start with the bad.<br /><br />Bad points : The casting choices(especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg),the acting of said badly chosen cast , the storyline , the idea of setting the film in the modern day , the direction , the editing , the soundtrack , and above all , the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that was n't that great to start with , despite it 's popularity.<br /><br />Good points : Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that 's it!<br /><br />One might make an analogy here . In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke struts her way up to Michael Weston as Enos , and asks the question,"Enos , where 's Boss Hogg and Roscoe?",in his clouded judgment , tells her where they are . She might just as well have asked,"Enos , is this a good movie?",the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes , even though in his right mind he would have said,"No , not really."As good as she looked in the bikini , she could have been stark naked , and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film - making . Stay out of Hazzard !
0 First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan , but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order . The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg . Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg , and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe , If they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop . He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with the usual errors , cars getting torn up , and continues like nothing happened . The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Billy Prickett , and the General is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop , but goes on to win the race .
0 This movie sucked ! They took something from my childhood , and raped it in an outhouse ! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and hold my " Dukes " dvds and cry in a corner . The cast was terrible ! It was n't " The Dukes " , it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car . When was Boss Hogg evil ? When was Rosco a tough guy ? They never were ! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot . When did Jesse smoke pot ? He never did ! Now do n't get me wrong , I'm very liberal and there 's nothing wrong with a little chiba , but it had no place in this movie ! The only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits . It was a waste of money time and air . Avoid at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 I 'll tell you what happened , some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV . Did we really need a big screen re - make ? Did they ask the fans ? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of " Rocky Horror Picture Show " with actors like Ashton Krutcher , Steve Martin , Britney Spears , and Kiefer Southerland , took out all the music , and made it a drama . Do you think they would like that ! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had . Sure the original was a bit corny at times , but Bo and Luke were always nice , they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble , and their main objective was to help people that passed through town . None of that mattered to the people that made this film , they might have never even seen the original show all the way through . My big question is , what will they ruin next ?
0 Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines , in spite of the good box office returns . If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next , STOP . Stop making our TV shows into these repellent , stupid , money grubbing waste of time movies that suck . By doing so you are proving one thing : Hollywood is out of ideas , and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust . What 's next -- You guys gon na go & ruin The Bionic Man??<br /><br />The film is just plain wrong , and manages to get the most stupid , simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting ( or ignoring ) that Tom Wopat & John Schneider 's Bo & Luke Duke were * REFORMED * moonshiners . They had been busted , learned their lesson , gone straight , and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen . Denver Pyle 's Uncle Jessie was also the moral center of the family , always insisting that the Boys do good , even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done . They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naiveté about them that was quite appealing . We wanted to be more like them than we were , sorta . My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off , which was apparently too moral for this film.<br /><br />By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering , wisecracking , criminally minded , redneck baiting , misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint , where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were -- Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys ? I wanted to punch them both in the nose . They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends , if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who have n't grown up . There should be no marijuana use , no gawking at buxom , nubile coeds & their breasts , no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood . All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies . The problem being that 14 year old boys can not possibly remember the show , IMHO should n't be seeing this movie either , and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers , director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money , which is exactly how I feel . What were they thinking???<br /><br />And boy did they * EVER * get Daisy wrong . Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace , but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her , printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom . She is hardly in the film at all ( which is the movie 's only saving grace ) , and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive . Catherine Bach 's Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts , and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her , but the Daisy she played was a * PERSON*. The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it . She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home . And most importantly she was a sweet , caring person who could n't help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her.<br /><br />By contrast , Jessica Simpson appears phony , contrived , made up , costumed , posed , aloof , bored , out of place , and I do n't think she even looks that great in the outfit . She does n't look like a person but a plot device , conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent . Ms. Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened . Whatever the joke was , she is n't in on it and is disgracefully exploited for T&A. If that 's all she wants from her career , executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least , because this effort was just pathetic.<br /><br />The bottom line is SKIP IT . For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together . That was why it worked . The only real purpose I can see in the film might be it 's future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay . Twenty minutes of this & they 'll be singing a choir.<br /><br />1/10 , and I mean it . And STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE BIONIC MAN , you schnooks .
0 If this movie should be renamed , it should be " The Jackasses of Hazzard . " To sum it up , this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 Dodge Charger around town and in the country , chasing the girls and eluding the law.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the " Dukes " and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key . The overindulgence of profanity , sexual references , and drug use , has made the good name of the " Dukes " into trailer trash.<br /><br />Side from comparing it to the television show , the acting was horrible . The only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee . The others have exaggerated the character 's role which tarnished the movie.<br /><br />The " Dukes " have been another casualty of the 21-st century Hollywood television - to - big screen transition tragedy . Skip this movie and just buy the television series on DVD.<br /><br />My grade : F
0 I do n't understand why making remakes has become the trend . Every remake I have ever seen is awful , and this is no exception . If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones , that it is a " sleazy " piece of trash , he is quite right . Why they would take a wonderful television show , which I loved , have never missed an episode , and own seasons 1 - 4 on DVD , and ruin it , I 'll never know . The television show was a family show , and although Daisy has the body , it was really flaunted , or even addressed in the show , save the outfits . A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage , and I would n't recommend anyone go see it . Another thing I did n't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors ( along with the rest of the original cast ) , and they are also extremely cute . The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute . That was one of the drawers for the show . The casting is terrible . They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy . I do n't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg , either . Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role . The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse , but still it is no comparison . Denver Pyle is an actor all his own , and that made him perfect for the role . I think that the casting is awful , the story is awful , and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty , terrible movie . I would n't recommend anyone go see it . I only saw it out of curiosity , plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD . I would never have paid to see this movie , but it was free . DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE .
0 When a movie like " The Dukes of Hazzard " brings in over $ 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society . Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe I 'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no - effort trash will appeal to.<br /><br />Hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen . This is that . I walked out despite getting a free movie pass . The dialogue could not be dumber . The stunts could not be more over - the - top and outrageous . Perhaps this " bigger that big " image appeals to Texans but it did n't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater . None of the " big names " were in this career - ending flick , except for Burt Reynolds , which says all you need to hear . Jessica Simpson -- do n't make me laugh.<br /><br />I would n't even recommend this film for video , even if you were desperate . This was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing . They did despite the public being forewarned . Stupidity abound .
0 Have I seen a worse movie ? Perhaps only " Manos : The Hands of Fate " dragged more than " Dukes " . I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point . Let 's touch on a few ... <br /><br />There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they do n't respond . He shrugs and moves on , since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he 's talking about ( nor do we ) . It was like the engine died and was restarted.<br /><br />The few times the General Lee flew through the air were n't even that exciting . Nothing I have n't seen on the TV Series.<br /><br />Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott . The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked . The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it ( although roughly ) . The rest of the time it seems distant and forced.<br /><br />Seann William Scott 's awful , horrendous accent ( or lack thereof).<br /><br />I hated Willie Nelson 's performance . Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing ? I wanted him to disappear.<br /><br />Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen . She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film . That 's telling you how horrible this movie is . She 's a goddess.<br /><br />During the climax of the film , I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County , starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices . A nuclear bomb would have sufficed.<br /><br />This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film , but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film.<br /><br />If only we could erase and start over ...
0 OK we all love the daisy dukes , but what is up with this cast . Lets start , Jessica Simpson as Daisy , there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy ! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original . No offense to Burt , but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall . That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size . Did they even try someone like Danny Devito ? ! ? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband ? He matches Luke Duke to a tee ! ! ! ! ! ! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members . The screen t 's were never present on the dukes ! ! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning . I give this a HUGE thumbs down .
0 The Dukes of Hazzard will academy awards ! ! Best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie.<br /><br />This " movie " was a torture to watch . So sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs . The only good thing about this crap was the car ! I remember when Daisy was a real threat to look 4ward 2 . Who 's the moron that decided that Jessica Simpson is hot ? ! We know she ca n't act but come on . In the TV show Daisy was a fox and brunette.<br /><br />All members who contributed in these waste of time please please please do n't even think about makin a sequel , a prequel or anything that 's got 2 do with a former TV show.<br /><br />I gave a empty DVD so this " movie " could be burned 4 me . I sat trough it and i want my money back !
0 I had suspicions the movie was going to be bad . I 'm a Duke 's fan from way back . Have three years of the TV series on DVD . Well I was right . Took the family to see it . I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good . But to sum it up , the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the TV show.<br /><br />Jessica Simpson was pathetic . While I can honestly say that the original Daisy 's outfits were just as revealing , Jessica Simpson 's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful . Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must be rolling in their graves as well.<br /><br />Don't waste your money . If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed .
0 i wo nt go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best . At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing . I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original . And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke . Those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all . And since when is American Pie have anything to do with the Dukes SHAME ON them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car . That in itself should have gotten the movie a R rating . The only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals . Lets all hope . So the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
0 Oh Geez ... There are so many other films I want to see out there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted - Yeah ... <br /><br />I used to watch this show when I was in college ... it was mindless , kinda fun , and somewhat action - oriented . The show had a good heart tho ... and the characters were cute ; no one ever got killed or even hurt badly ... it was like a cartoon come to life . Cut to 2005 ... What happened ? This one does n't work . As others have said , there simply is n't a cohesive story and the performances are weird ... almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters ... the whole thing is a like a Mad TV skit and it lasts over 100 minutes ! This was one of the few times I 've been EMBARRASSED watching a film . What were they thinking ? As best I can tell , must 've been for the product marketing , toys , etc . All I can say is , let this one die a quick death . It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard seem like Masterpiece Theater ... <br /><br />I think the only remake left to do from TV is Gilligan 's Island ... Good Luck !
0 I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new " Dukes " movie is a modernized version . OH PLEASE . If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood can keep it . Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)"You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is . " Well let me tell you something , I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE , and I wo n't get over it , it was a DISGRACE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY . The only thing right in the movie title was " HAZZARD . " Was all the profanity , smoking , and drinking really necessary . The cast was terrible . Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head . She is in NO way a Daisy Duke , a fluke maybe , but definitely no Duke . I love Sean Williams Scott , but not as Bo . They should have included the original cast as at least cameos , but even Hollywood knew they would n't approve of the script . I mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks .
0 If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children . If you 've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case ! This movie was HORRIBLE ! Main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment . They took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash . Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services . I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out , 15 minutes into the movie I was ready to leave . I stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute . I wish I had never seen this movie . It trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when I left . Do yourself a favor , go see something worth your money , cause it 's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back !
0 The 1980s TV show , updated with fresh female flesh , and raunchy language . " The Dukes of Hazzard " passed me by ; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in either New York or California ; or , I probably would have watched . Still , from somewhere ( like the clips accompanying this film 's updated 2005 release ) , I knew it was about a fast , orange Dodge Charger - and , the " General Lee " is still good to go . < br /><br />Hunky cousins Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville ( as Bo and Luke Duke ) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage . Beautiful Jessica Simpson ( as Daisy ) fills her skimpy short well - but , even her arousing pink bikini ca n't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing , topless coeds . The too stupid plot involves a graying Burt Reynolds ( as " Boss " Hogg ) threatening to turn Hazzard County into a strip - mine.<br /><br / > * * The Dukes of Hazzard ( 7/27/05 ) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott , Johnny Knoxville , Jessica Simpson , Burt Reynolds
0 DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT , JOHN SCHNEIDER , CATHERINE BACH , SORRELL BOOKE , JAMES BEST , DENVER PYLE , SONNY SHROYER , AND BEN JONES ! THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY ! First of all , this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse . Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series ! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series . In the series , Uncle Jesse was honest , and law - abiding . In this movie , he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia . Plus , if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion ! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood , I have one question : HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE ? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997 ! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD ? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE , WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS ? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie , they should have brought back James Best , John Schneider , Tom Wopat , Ben Jones , and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting , disgraced movie ! If you want to see good Dukes movies , either buy the original series , or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion , and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies ! They both star the original cast , and are family friendly ! Do n't waste your time on a movie that is n't worth the CD it 's written on !
0 Once again , like Charlie 's Angels , Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds , a TV series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched . Basically the Duke cousins , Luke ( Johnny Knoxville ) and Bo ( Seann William Scott ) in Hazzard County , spend a lot of time driving very fast in " The General Lee " . But they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty Jefferson Davis ' Boss ' Hogg ( Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds ) to make way for a huge coal mine . They get help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy ( Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson ) and Uncle Jesse ( Willie Nelson ) , while being chased by equally mean Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane ( Lost 's M.C. Gainey ) and the police . Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite , Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg , David Koechner as Cooter Davenport , Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline . I think the only reason I give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts , and of course the gorgeous body of Simpson ( I 'll admit her legs are n't quite Catherine Bach , but still ! ) , but besides that it is pretty boring . It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture , Worst Director for Jay Chandrasekhar , Worst Remake or Sequel , Worst Screen Couple for Simpson & Her " Daisy Dukes " and Worst Screenplay . Pretty poor !
0 The Dukes of Hazzard is quite an achievement  a $ 53 m film that 's worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25-year old TV show . The plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious : Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist , M.C. Gainey 's Sheriff Roscoe is a bland thug , Michael Weston 's Enos tiresome , a seemingly ideally - cast Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and Burt Reynolds , stuck in some purgatory where he 's doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player , is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill . You know a film is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences   But worse than the script or the casting is Jay Chandrasekhar 's hopeless direction : seemingly born with no conception of comic timing , unable to do much more than basic two - shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film , he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise . There are a couple of neat post - modern moments revolving around the Confederate Flag and Daisy 's stereotypical role in every episode , but no film that makes you pine for the days when Hal Needham was directing this sort of thing ( and badly ) can be a good thing .
0 I 'll say one thing about this film : there are no lulls . You ca n't get bored watching this . The problem is that it is TOO intense . There is too much action and it NEEDS lulls ! That is the risk you take in modern action films . You want it interesting but not overdone . This is way overdone.<br /><br />Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of " names " in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider , it still has the feel of a " B " film . The best part of it is Scheider 's dialog : the only " A " part of this " B " film.<br /><br />The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes . One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines . That was memorable . Not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long .
0 Well , sorry for the mistake on the one line summary ....... Run people , run ! ! This movie is an horror ! ! Imagine ! Gary Busey in another low budget movie , with an incredibly bad scenario ... isn't that a nightmare ? No ( well yes ) , it is Plato 's run ........... I give it * out of * * * * * .
0 It is enjoyable and fast - paced . < br /><br />There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen . However , the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly . It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him . I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance , most of the others were also very engaging . In particular , the interplay between the policemen was natural and well - balanced , and worked very well.<br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long , so the plot is not complex . More key is the style of the whole thing . It is very slick and vibrant , and the backdrops are atmospheric , especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich . The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences , but still manages to be distinctly Australian .
0 Except for the acting of Meryl Streep , which is of note as always , I 'd avoid this film because it has a dated " Movie of the Week " quality about it . But it is worth watching if you keep the several understories in mind : How a couple endures media scrutiny , and how the different are treated.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different . Australians are different than " us " ( most of the rest of the world ) , so we ( most of us ) automatically come at it with an air of " oddness " about them . The couple involved is religious ( different than most of culture ) and Adventists ( different ) at that . So their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with . Dingos are different animals than other dogs , so again we 're faced with oddness questions . The real story , then , is how society ( and the world ) treats the different , those who have different accents , different beliefs , than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect.<br /><br />It 's difficult to hear the phrase " A dingo took my baby ! " without laughing and there are humorous posts , sadly , all over the web about it . But in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered ( as you 'll find in web searches ) that much larger children have been stalked by dingos . Research by experts in dingos have shown that it was not only possible but most probable that the baby was taken by dingos ( maybe a pair ) , extracted expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments without a trace.<br /><br />Yet what is left behind is the question of why people defended dingos when they were found to be endangering children rather than killing the dingo to save the children , why because a woman 's affect ( expression ) is so cold she is assumed to be guilty , and on and on.<br /><br />Haunting questions , with or without the film .
0 It 's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds . Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life , melodramatic , overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.<br /><br />If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and , yes , it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions . < br /><br />Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad .
0 There 's nothing amazing about ' The Amazing Mr Williams ' . Part of this movie 's problem is its lead actor Melvyn Douglas . He was a lousy actor and lazy with it . For most of his career , he allowed his good looks , a glib manner and ( usually , but not in this movie ) some fine scriptwriting to make up for his lack of acting ability . I disliked Douglas as an actor before I knew anything about him as a person ; I 've learnt enough about him to know that I also despise his politics . I 'll give Melvyn Douglas credit for one thing : his chromosomes did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress Illeana Douglas.<br /><br />Melvyn Douglas made this movie right after the brilliant ' Ninotchka ' ... talk about a comedown ! ' The Amazing Mr Williams ' is allegedly a comedy , but I never laughed . Douglas plays a plainclothes detective on the homicide squad , named Kenny Williams . I never heard of a police detective named Kenny , but if they called him Kenneth Williams ... well , what a carry - on . The whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about , killing women . No motive is given for this ; he just likes to kill women . The mayor ( Jonathan Hale , better than usual ) calls Williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killer.<br /><br />SPOILERS APPROACHING . The cheap , vulgar , untalented and unattractive Joan Blondell plays the mayor 's secretary . ( She does n't sound literate enough to file a letter , much less type one . ) Blondell and Douglas squabble like a cat and a dog , so it 's blatantly obvious they 're going to end up together.<br /><br />At this movie 's lowest point , Melvyn Douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman . You do NOT want to see Melvyn Douglas in drag ! He 's well over six foot , and he does n't even shave off that annoying moustache . The similarly-'tashed William Powell was an actor very similar in type to Melvyn Douglas ( but much more talented ) . When Powell disguised himself as a woman in ' Love Crazy ' , he had the integrity to shave off his moustache : a genuine sacrifice , as Powell needed it to grow in again for his next role . But Melvyn Douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie , not even a razor . He plays his drag scenes with the same annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his career.<br /><br />On the plus side , ' The Amazing Mr Williams ' has several of those splendid supporting players who made Hollywood 's movies of the ' 30s so delightful . Edward Brophy is brilliant here , touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely furlough from his life sentence . The dyspeptic Donald MacBride is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer , and is nearly lynched by a mob . Ruth Donnelly is splendid : as usual for her , but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual orbit on the Warner Brothers backlot . Jimmy Conlin , Luis Alberni and the grinning Dave Willock are all fine in small roles . Barbara Pepper ( whom I usually dislike ) is good here too . The grossly unpleasant Maude Eburne gets some screen time ; I always loathe her , and she gives the same performance in every film ... but some audiences enjoy Eburne 's one - note performance very much , for reasons I ca n't fathom.<br /><br />If you 're familiar with Hollywood character actors of the 1930s , and the roles they tended to play , one glance at IMDb 's cast list will tell you who the murderer is . That 's the problem with ' The Amazing Mr Wiliams ' : everything is too obvious . I 'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10 .
0 When Ben ( Red Foxx ) discovers his wife Beatrice ( Pearl Bailey ) has run off with his own brother , he rushes to his son Norman ( Michael Warren ) to unload his tale of woe -- only to discover that Norman has a secret lover : the effeminate Garson ( Dennis Dugan . ) Needless to say , Ben does not take it well , and numerous complications follow -- including Ben 's attempt to get Norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker ( Tammy Dobson . ) Unfortunately , this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself.<br /><br />Originally written for the theatre by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick , NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU ? was an absolute disaster on the New York stage . To give the play its due , I actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production -- and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce , the cast played so broadly and in such drop - dead manner that it proved quite amusing . It is a pity the cast of this film did n't do the same.<br /><br />This is an atrociously performed motion picture . Red Foxx , one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century , is about as funny here as yesterday 's wash , Michael Warren ( who later appeared on the television series HILL STREET BLUES to much better effect ) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance , and Pearl Bailey is not far behind ; truth be told , only Dennis Duggan , Tammy Dobson , and a cameo by Wayland Flowers have any spark -- and sadly , that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Not only is the film badly performed , it looks bad . According to film lore , this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape , which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes -- and believe me , it shows . The film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of Norman and Garson 's apartment.<br /><br />Some films are so bad that they become funny , but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU ? is n't one of them . I can sum up my reaction to this film in two words : miss it . Do n't buy it , do n't rent it , do n't touch it with a ten foot pole . Just back away slowly and then run like hell.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor , aka GFT , Amazon Reviewer
0 I have no idea as to which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy - of - ills . With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s , " Norman " plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings , not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers ! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark , this tale of an estranged married couple ( Foxx and Pearl Bailey ) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay -- and living with a mincing , prancing white homosexual -- has enough limp - wristed jokes to shame any early episode of " Three 's Company " . Bailey keeps her dignity , and Foxx 's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles , but the rest of the performers are humiliated . * from * * * *
0 This snarky , homophobic thing was dated in 1976 . It seems particularly mean - spirited now , filled with gay stereotypes , and characters that are meant to be laughed at , rather than with . Redd Foxx does his standard schtick , Michael Warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character , and Pearl -- Pearl what were you thinking-- ? Pearl Bailey deserves far better .
0 This is the second British Rank film to adapt the stories of Sommerset Maugham to film . All but one story from ' Quartet ' does not travel well into the contempory era ; and the actors speech is decidedly " clipped " , as only British pre-1950 's actors delivery can be . In anycase ' Trio ' seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation.<br /><br />One of the problems these two films ca n't overcome is that their source material was written 25 - 30 years prior to the films . Consequently , by the 1950 's Maughm 's ( pre - war ) popularist " small morality " storyteling seemed rather quaint , if not downright coy .
0 I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal ( and still have my DS : TMOB poster autographed by him ) at a convention shortly after the release , and asked him why he chose to do the film " camp " . Before he could answer , two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio " knew best " and how " no one will take such a film seriously " . I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend ( ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band ? I was in a couple of years of that with him ) , and had higher hopes than what we got.<br /><br />The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously , and so doing ' camp ' was the only way . Several other fans jumped in on my side , with Pal listening as best he could . At the end of the little event , Pal came up to us and apologized , wishing he could have done more and better.<br /><br />STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks , and a year after Pal 's death , Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise ... if it had n't been for the flacks.<br /><br />Tear out the memory or history of Doc , and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.<br /><br />But destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.<br /><br />Doc Savage can still come to the screen , and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill - informed to Indiana Jones , but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero.<br /><br />SIDENOTES : Yes , there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL , and it 's a lot more serious . Yes , there was simultaneous footage shot , but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors . And , yes , there _ is _ a one - sheet of Ron Ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol . Ely 's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie , and the words " DOC SAVAGE : ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Coming Next Summer ! " POSTSCRIPT : If anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention , smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are . At the time , they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants , and carrying Paramount portfolios .
0 After Watergate , Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras , what the world needed was a good old - fashioned chapter - play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of 1936 or the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures . Unfortunately what it got in 1975 was Doc Savage , The Man of Bronze . Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal 's final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson 's pulp - paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other " We can do better than that , " and adding a bullwhip , a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix.<br /><br />A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman  explorer , adventurer , philanthropist , a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach - blonde bulletproof muscle - bound body of a Greek God ( or rather the form of TV 's Tarzan , Ron Ely , a rather dull Charlton Heston clone here ) , there 's simply nothing he ca n't do and , more damagingly , nothing that can harm him . The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler 's Aryan ubermensch ( no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany ! ) , albeit with all - American values . And just in case there should ever be anything he 's overlooked ( not that there ever is ) he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage , the ( less than ) Fabulous Five . A chemist , an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept , and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer , but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures ? In reality Doc 's brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even Kryptonite would n't put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories , though with the exception of Paul Gleason they 're all so horribly badly cast and overplayed ( as are most parts in the film ) you 'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles . The villains fare no better , with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas , Scott Walker ( no , a different one ) delivering one of cinema 's worst accents ( is it meant to be Scottish , Irish , Welsh , Greek , Pakistani or some nationality no - one has ever heard of ? ) while Robyn Hilton 's Marilyn Monroe - ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris ( no relation ) a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes.<br /><br />Even with those drawbacks , this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes , a pool of gold , a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive , all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc 's father was murdered . Unfortunately it 's a question of tone : in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes were n't brooding figures prone to state - of - the - art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low - budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought , the films aimed purely at the matinée market : you know , for kids . There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight - faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post - production , be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc 's eye , the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust - up with Captain Seas or Don Black 's gung - ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa 's patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with . After all , it 's hard to see how one of the villain 's underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat , while Doc 's explanation to Pamela Hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West 's Batman . Instead , the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional , such as Doc displaying his sixth sense by , er , bobbing his Adam 's apple.<br /><br />Perhaps an even bigger problem is that , while promising on paper , the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion , be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys . Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson : having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier , Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them.<br /><br />Still , aside from Doc 's various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze , the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L.A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp 's cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget . And it 's good to see a superhero movie that does n't spend most of its running time on an origin story , though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself.<br /><br />It 's a film I 'd really like to like more , but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities . No wonder Doc Savage , The Arch Enemy of Evil , the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits , never happened .
0 Doc Savage : The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie . Poorly scripted , over - acted , and just plain silly . That being said ... it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level . This movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer . It 's one of those movies like " Santa Claus conquers the Martians " or " Yor , the Hunter from the Future " ... so bad it is almost good . If you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch . It 's campy . It 's fun . It has a theme by Sousa . If you 're looking for a good movie though , look elsewhere . 3/10.<br /><br />BTW , I 've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake ...
0 Fantastically putrid . I do n't mean to imply above that only a few people should avoid " Doc Savage . " Almost every demographic group would be bored by this trivial , TV - movie - quality production . It 's a little like the 60 's " Batman " TV series , except it 's not funny . Even accidentally . You 're better off taking a nap .
0 DOC SAVAGE : THE MAN OF BRONZE ( 1 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Dreadful , dreadful movie ... based on the pulp magazine / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a super - heroic adventure hero in the ' 30s and his five assistants , all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil . It was a pretty hokey series ... but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager . I knew they made a movie version in the ' 70s , starring Ron ( Tarzan ) Ely ... but I never got a chance to see it . It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV . Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why . The plot and characters are never treated seriously ... it 's all kind of tongue - in - cheek and campy ... kind of like the old Batman TV series ... only without the benefit of being funny ... or having any visual flair . Corny dialogue , cheesy special effects , dumb stereotypes , crummy action scenes and bad , bad acting . Actually , I find it kind of fascinating in its badness ... what could they have possibly been thinking ? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern - day remake ... but I do n't imagine that would have turned out to be much better .
0 After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was : Is this supposed to be irony or not ? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series , I knew this film was not meant to be ironic . So , the story tells us about an US - American Super - Doc saving a south American republic from evil . Sounds like a typical story . But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous . The mandatory end - fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen . The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example .
0 I dug this out and watched it tonight . I honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time I saw it . I remember it being a seriously flawed film . I do n't remember it being THIS bad!!!!!<br /><br />I am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly . Who am I to blame for this ? The 2 guys who wrote ( and I use that word loosely ) the script ? The casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story ? ( Only 2 of them are among " the amazing 5 " . ) The director , who clearly refused to take it seriously , and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing & bad acting everywhere ? ( I LIKED the theme song-- but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film ! ) Don Black , who should be ASHAMED at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music?<br /><br />It figures that I should pull this out , less than a week after re - reading the comic - book adaptation . The first 15 - 20 minutes of the film more - or - less ( really , LESS ) parallel the first issue of the comic . As I watched it tonight , I kept wondering-- why was ALMOST every single detail changed ? Doc showing up , then using his wrist - watch remote - control to open the safe , and the sniper 's bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass , were just about the only things left the same . I mean , if you 're gon na do an " adaptation " , WHY in God 's name change EVERYTHING???<br /><br />Once they leave Doc 's HQ , virtually NOTHING is as it was in the comic ( which , given Roy Thomas , I figure probably follows the book ) . I read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie . Again-- WHY ? I 've heard it was changed because they were n't able to secure the kind of budget they wanted . I look at the film , and think ... LACK OF MONEY in NO WAY explains what I saw on the screen!!<br /><br />You know , when people complain about Joel Schumacher , they should really take a look at this thing . The best thing I can say is , I think it would make a great double - feature with the 1966 BATMAN feature-- and probably a great triple - bill with that and the 1980 FLASH GORDON . All 3 films are " silly " . Maybe we can " blame " the 1966 film ( and TV series ) for this . Some fans have complained over the years that Adam West 's BATMAN ruined the image of comic - books in the minds of generations of non - comics fans . I think the same could be said for Hollywood . I 'm reminded of how many really , really BAD films based on " classic " characters have been made over the years , especially ( it seems to me ) in the late 70 's & early 80 's . Charlie Chan , Fu Manchu , Tarzan , Buck Rogers , Flash Gordon , The Lone Ranger-- all " murdered " by Hollywood types who think , " OH , comic - books ! So you know it 's supposed to be STUPID ! " More like they 're the " stupid " ones . What a waste of potential.<br /><br />Let me say some good things ... Despite the script and the directing , Ron Ely is GREAT . When I read a DOC SAVAGE story , I do n't think of the James Bama paintings , I think of Ely . Bill Lucking ( who later was a regular on THE A - TEAM ) is terrific . Eldon Quick ( who I 've seen somewhere else , but ca n't recall where ) is terrific . Paul Gleason-- who I absolutely HATED with a passion and a vengeance in THE BREAKFAST CLUB ( " teachers " like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere ) , may be the best of the " amazing 5 " in the film . Pamela Hensley-- though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story-- is terrific . Before she let her hair down , I also realized she looked a HELL of a lot like " Ardala Valmar " from those awful John Calkins BUCK ROGERS strips I just read the other day . She 's got a big nose like Ardala-- only not quite as pronounced . The comics Ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie Princess Aura-- or Cher . Or maybe Streisand . Take yer pick . ( Ardala actually got plastic surgery in the George Tuska strips-- after , she was stunning!)<br /><br />Paul Wexler , funny enough , I saw just last week in a GET SMART episode . I wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing ? I do n't know , because that character sure was n't in the movie the film takes its title from .
0 I saw this film in its premier week in 1975 . I was 13 years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun . I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories . I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc , but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet . I read ( and still own ) all of the Bantam books , I started going to comic book cons ( along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events ) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5 . Philip Jose Farmer 's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase . In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat . It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up . The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story . These stories from the 30 's were short and if one looked at Lester Dent 's ( AKA Kenneth Robeson ) outline for writing them , they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment . One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm , it would have turned out better . The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there , but then fall short . It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second - string character actors ( guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film ) who all acquit themselves very well . Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial . All the rest have fallen off the map sadly . I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero , but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful . I would say 0 but I give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction ( Doc 's answering machine at the end was a nice touch ) and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun .
0 Cynthia Rothrock,(China O'Brien),"Manhattan Chase",2000 , made this film enjoyable to watch and of course , e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body . China O'Brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad , who is the local sheriff . Her dad is getting older and the town has changed , gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to Hell . Well , you almost can guess what happens , and you are right , China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life . Bad acting through out the picture , but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion .
0 I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien . And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse . But : worse = funnier ! And funnier = better . If you 're a bad movie fan like I am , this is great material . If , however , you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot , acting ability , or movie - making skill , this is best avoided . The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast - forward . Hilariously bad . See it for a laugh , see it for mindless entertainment , but whatever you do , see it for free on TV .
0 Play Mystery Theater 3000 at home with your friends ! Rent this movie for the laughs ! The acting is poor , the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable . I thought the movie was a joke until I looked it up on IMBD . I ca n't wait to rent the sequel , China O'Brien II .
0 I caught this movie on FX last night , and as I was sitting there watching it , it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever . Bad acting , bad cinematography , bad sound , totally unbelievable fight sequences , stupid characters . All these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie I 've ever seen . It was so bad , I was enthralled by it 's sheer lack of anything semi - competent that I had to keep watching ... and they made a sequel !
0 When I read the summary of the movie , something like what happens when a man gets powers of a God , and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength , I though that was clever and original concept . Casting was promising too , Carrey , Freeman , Aniston ... How can movie with a good idea and good actors , not to mention costs of filming , can be bad ? It can . Idea is good , but script and story itself is terrible . Bruce Nolan is , let 's be honest , a pretty mediocre journalist , with not exactly great stories ( like a story of a giant cookie , what a faux pas , and the Niagara report is complete fiasco ! ) , he 's a man with a job he completely DESERVES ( he 's not a good journalist , he 's a comedian ) , considering his potentials , with a nice home , sugar sweet girlfriend , and OH HORROR ! ! ! ! Dog who is not house trained ! ! ! Yes , as soon as Bruce , at the beginning of the movie starts addressing GOd in a " God , why do you hate me ! " manner , average viewer must think : " Why , what 's wrong with your life , Bruce ? " . Bruce is not , and definitely NOT the man with real problems in life . Most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes , and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity . Most people have really big problems , worth of attention , most people are more worth of attention that Bruce , who does n't seem too human after all , does n't look even realistic , too goofy and neurotic , but God still addresses to him . Why ? Though Morgan Freeman looks nice as a God , I ca n't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie . And what does Bruce do when God gives him his powers ? God in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference . No , wait , a smart kid would probably use his God powers better than Bruce . What does Bruce do ? Pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere , parts the red soup , lifts up a pretty woman 's dress on the street , answers prayers via e - mail and make all of them come true ! ! ! ! No more , Bruce , please ! What Bruce did could actually end the world , but in the movie , that does n't happen , because this is " nice , family , little movie " and does n't make any sense at all ! ! ! Not a hint of sarcasm , of real humor , of wittiness , of some dirty humor at least ! ! ! Nothing . Just Carrey playing silly , which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor . Aniston here is understated . She plays pale , undeveloped character of Bruce 's girlfriend Grace , and stays completely forgettable in this movie . Nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them . When Grace says prayer for Bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic , but completely false . These two are not meant to be together . I would give three stars , but I doubt movie deserves a one . Bad script , lame dialogs , lack of real humor , wittiness and any sophistication , as well as undeveloped characters and understated Freeman 's and Aniston 's roles , total lack of boldness and sarcasm , it all makes movie hardly worth * * * . But OK , there were few funny moments , and Freeman is always nice to see in any movie so , lets leave three stars .
0 Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today . With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy , and we love him for it . He has the ability to make mediocre comedies ( ala Ace Ventura ) , and turn them into decent comedic outings . Or , in the case of ' Liar Liar ' , make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around . Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas . He was excellent in both ' Man on the Moon ' and ' The Truman Show . ' The guy is remarkable.<br /><br />Then comes ' Bruce Almighty , ' an ideal vehicle for Carrey , and a premise that should have worked ; Carrey , after complaining about God and how his life stinks , is enabled with God 's powers . However , the script is pure recycled garbage . Now , no matter how bad a script is , Carrey 's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny . The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects , only some of which are amusing . Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects . The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny , because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless . He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention , wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny , when it 's really just annoying.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on ' Friends ' and she was superb in last year 's ' The Good Girl . ' She too has a gift for comedy , but with the script as linear as it is , she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend . She comes across as nagging , grumpy , and there is no chemistry between the two stars.<br /><br />'Bruce Almighty ' should have been a comedy that works . But it does n't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it 's making fun of ; religion . A few minor giggles ( his internet is Yehweh ) , but instead it 's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy . Not to mention that it 's tone shifts from silly to heavy - handed , and even black comedy at times . The movie fails on nearly every level . That 's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs , but it 's close . Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it 's laughs has problems . But hey , if you find pee jokes funny , go for it.<br /><br / >
0 Why did I go to see this film ? Honestly , because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter , so do you really blame me for expecting that again ? Additionally , the premise , the funny trailer , his co - star Jennifer Aniston 's involvement , and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.<br /><br />However , as my " one line Summary " suggests , I was Disappointed . For various reasons;<br /><br />Reason 1 : It was n't funny . In a 2hour movie , I laughed for about 5 - 10minutes ... all together , the rest of the time I sat thinking " I really should have got some ice - cream " . I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films , but what does he really expect when he makes Gem 's such as ' The Truman Show ' , ' Liar Liar ' , ' Me , Myself and Irene ' , ' Dumb and Dumber ' , ' The Mask ' , and the ' Ace Ventura ' films then produces , in Bruce Nolan 's own words , such a mediocre film?<br /><br />Reason 2 : Jennifer Aniston 's role was criminally underwritten . I mean hello ! She 's been around in the public eye for about ten years now , and in this film she gets about four lines to say . Wrong.<br /><br />Reason 3 : One word - Cliché < br /><br />Reason 4 : A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa , Walter Cronkite ' sweeps week ' - is a clue to the film 's specifically home - grown appeal . " A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that 's a miracle ! Want to see a miracle soon ? Be the miracle ! " God tells Bruce , a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US , but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety . Additionally , I still go to school , and that statement suggests me and all of my friend 's are miracles ... or maybe it just means we have brains?<br /><br />In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity , but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards .
0 I was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions : Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me . As a huge fan , I was sure he 'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise , and what could go wrong ? Yesterday , my bubble got burst big - time , boys and girls , because I saw the movie . < br /><br />The first act ( where it 's set up that he hates his life , he 's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God ) is serviceable , the second act ( where he 's summoned by God via telephone and receives Powers Almighty ) is GREAT - Carrey gets to have fun with his new ' toys ' and it 's a pleasure to watch , really funny . But the third act is wretched beyond belief.<br /><br />The rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace ( Jennifer Aniston , who comes off EXCEEDINGLY well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device ; even her NAME reeks of unsubtlety ) - she thinks he 's gon na pop ' the question ' but instead , he tells her ( on bended knee , yet ) that he 's finally getting his news anchor job , and is n't it so exciting?<br /><br />She does n't think so . She wants him to marry her , see , so she winds up leaving him , see , even though she still LOVES him very much , see , and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic , beyond - heavy - handed spiritual - sounding cliche after the next , until by the end I was praying , too . . .for it to be over . < br /><br />I did n't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts ( one example - in the 2nd act , after he gets his powers , Bruce prances into the room singing " What if God were one of us , just a slob like one of us " , blah blah blah ) , and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us ( for openers , Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce he ca n't violate anyone 's free will but he does this , a lot ) . Those choices were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy , directed by Tom Shadyac - it ai nt The Remains of the Day . < br /><br />Or rather it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy . When the script writers lose track of that ( in the dreaded act 3 ) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of ( gag ) Message Movie , what we get instead is hell on earth . Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways , he realizes that GRACE is his saving - have to say it - grace , and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued . All this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy - handed way , however . The film did n't have to go into the dumper to make these points . Unfortunately , the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever , light - handed way , so they went the bang-'em - over - the - heads route in hopes that we would n't notice . They even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out - takes at the end , in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste . It did n't work for me .
0 The plot of ' House of Games ' is the strongest thing about it : a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters , but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do , she finally gets her revenge . That 's about the pitch : but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets . It has to be the director Mamet : Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and pretty steady TV and film career , so she ca n't perform this badly all the time . She 's supposed to go from uptight , cool , controlled professional to calculating , wicked fast lady having fun , as shown by the change from beige trouser suit ( which she seems to wear for three days straight , including underwear ) to floppy floral sundress . But everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped , precise way ; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed . The effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create . At times ' House of Games ' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk , and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot . The clunky vibes'n'oboe faux - jazz soundtrack does n't help either . The ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome , and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic , two - dimensional performances . And they smoke too much ! ! !
0 David Mamet 's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking - man 's movie , a movie that makes you question everybody and everything . I saw it for the first time recently and could n't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.<br /><br />The movie is about a female psychologist named Margaret who is also a best - selling author . Margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone . She tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient 's gambling debt to a shark named Mike ( played by Joe Mantegna , who is the only reason to watch this film ) . She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her . Intrigued , she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate ( she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book ) . She then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.<br /><br />I do n't feel like going into details , but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by Mike and his cronies to swindle Margaret out of $ 80,000.<br /><br />First of all , the big twist towards the end was VERY predictable . Any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads . Not only that , but the audience ( and the main character ) knows that they 're dealing with con men , so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has herself been conned ? Besides , Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people , yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind , she knows full well that Mike is a con artist.<br /><br />Secondly , we are led to believe that Margaret was conned from the very beginning , yet in order for the con to ultimately work , she had to do several things that the con men could n't possibly have predicted that she would do . First , she had to decide to help settle her patient 's debt , allowing her to meet the con men in the first place . If she had n't done this , the entire con would have failed . I just have to say that it 's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient 's gambling debt . Not only that , but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up ? Did they simply show up at that bar every night , hoping she would come and see them ? Another thing that had to happen that could n't have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade . What are the odds of this happening ? And yet the whole con is based on this premise.<br /><br />Another problem I had is with the ending . Margaret finds out she 's been conned and decides to get revenge on Mike . At first , Mamet leads us to believe that she 's going to con the con , but that falls through , so the ultimate ending is her gunning Mike down in an airport baggage area . Somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade . Not only that , but she did n't even take back the money he stole from her.<br /><br />Ultimately , the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled . And if you , like me , predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned , you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying .
0 The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that I have to assume that that was the desired intent . The sets are artificial and at no time did I not feel that I was watching a movie . It seemed like the actors were just reading their lines , rather than responding to one another . While the film has elements of early film noir ( except that it is in color ) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre.<br /><br />Given that the presentation had no appeal to me , I was at least expecting an engaging story . Usually I am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists , but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes . By the time of the , " Gee , I forgot the $ 80,000 , " moment , I thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous . For a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief . If at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person , the whole story would have fallen apart.<br /><br />This wooden production left me cold .
0 By far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must , at least occasionally , be able to pull one over on us , as well as their dumb - witted marks , the cops , the mob and ( ideally ) each other . But this film NEVER pulls this off . Every scam can be seen coming a mile off ( especially the biggen ! ) Neither are they very interesting , intricate or sophisticated . Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships . If so , he failed . The lines are alright , but they 're delivered in such a stilted , unnatural , stylised way that I thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time ... but it was n't . As for the psychological complexity , the main character 's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she 's a whore , but she gets over it . I really liked the street scenes though . Looked just like an Edward Hopper painting .
0 Here 's a review for people like me . This movie sucks from beginning to end . I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSF2000 . The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart . The lead falls for a con man and it does n't occur to her that she might get conned ? ? ? ? ? And she 's rich ? ? ? ? And she 's a famous psychologist ? ? ? ? ? COME ON , people . She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her ? ? ? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half - witted movie viewers . Rain man would have been insulted . I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat - eaters , war - starters , and fur - wearers . My hatred is so complete that it defies logic . But I 'll give it a shot . That it 's not supposed to sound real is fine . I do n't care . It 's that everyone talks the SAME . Mamet ca n't create characters ; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors . No wonder his actors are so wooden . They 're confused about everyone being the same character . ( However , his later films do improve . )
0 This movie had potential , but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse 's acting . I 've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else , but her performance in this movie is bad.<br /><br />Her delivery is robotic . When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head . So , her voice has very little inflection . I ca n't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie . She has to know somebody in the biz.<br /><br />Now I hate to be this mean about her , but the comment has to be " this " long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.<br /><br />However , I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it . The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie . But the end was disappointing as well . Maybe if her acting had been better , I would have liked it .
0 This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and this is the sickest , in my opinion . A bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her . And at this point , I will say that these films are NOT real ! They are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.<br /><br />The scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases . For example , when they kick the girl in the floor , we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl ! And how stupid this looks ! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do n't make sense . Other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl , the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours , the ripping off of fingernails , worms placed on the wounds in the girl 's body , the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that . Very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant . This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig , although it is not as bloody as the next part , Flowers of Flesh and Blood , which tries to be as shocking as possible.<br /><br />Guinea Pig : Devil 's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I 've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is . This is still ( of course ) faked s(n / t)uff , the only difference to genuine " snuff film " is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film . I can not recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive . They who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it . I watched this as a curiosity ( as the other parts in the series ) and now I know how insignificant trash these are . They work only in shock level and that 's not too valuable cinematic achievement . Devil 's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I 've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole ( Guinea Pig 4 ) is perhaps the most disgusting film I 've seen . So these are pretty extreme in my book , but that 's all they are .
0 Ah , the infamous " Guinea Pig " series ... I honestly have to say that I 've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ( " He Never Dies","Mermaid in a Manhole " , and " Flower of Flesh and Blood " being the exceptions ... and even those are n't great by any means ... ) , but " Devil 's Experiment " just plain blows . There is nothing realistic - looking going on here , other than the climactic ( or perhaps anti - climactic , depending on how you view it ) eyeball piercing scene . The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to " hideous " ( more often sometimes " hilarious " ) tortures . " Flower of Flesh and Blood " is a more violent and gory depiction of fake " snuff " material , but that film also falls flat on the realism level . I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries , and they 've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in " extreme " film - making , but " Devil 's Experiment " just does n't hold up . Worth a look if you are a die - hard , if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about , but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that 's only for the needle - through - the - eye scene ...
0 Devil 's Experiment : 1/10 : Hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot ( Gee that is one lucky pizza boy ) and those without ( Anal Amateurs 36 ) . Devil 's Experiment falls solidly into the latter category . < br /><br />It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn . An almost completely plot less 43-minute wait for the money shot . Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non - descript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl . The tortures range from the banal ( slapping her 50 times , kicking her a hundred ) , the silly ( tying her to an office chair and spinning her around ) , the fear factor ( a bath of maggots and sheep guts ) and finally the money shot . ( A well executed eyeball piercing ) . < br /><br />That 's it , no plot , no motive , just Blair Witch tree shots and torture . The girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling , " no one expects the Spanish Inquisition " during the office chair scene I was bored silly . Staring dumbfounded at the screen , waiting for the money shot . Just like hardcore porn .
0 Not that I tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed , but when I put a DVD in expecting a bloodbath , and what I get is one bloody scene ( the eyeball ) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping , and spinning in a desk chair , I end up thinking " well that 's 43 minutes of my life gone forever . " I would n't considers this or Flower of Flesh and Blood " movies " so much as an exercise of will ; to see if you can sit through them . Flower of Flesh and Blood had a few tough spots to watch . The Devil 's Experiment did not . It was at best , stupid , and at worst ... well ... really stupid . Perhaps my expectation were too high . I put the DVD thinking " oh man , this is gon na be sick . " After watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times , I was watching it in fast forward.<br /><br />Two kinds of people would be interested in this film . 1 ) People who seek out F'd up films just to see how F'd up it really is , or 2 ) horror completest . I sought this and the other Guinea Pig films for the latter reason , but even if I fell into the category of the former , this film would n't float my boat . As a matter of fact , I could imagine this film increasing one 's blood lust ... as in " WOULD YOU JUST KILL THE B*TCH ALREADY ! ! " So in conclusion , the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes . If you want carnage that traditional horror does n't provide , get Traces of Death . Sure , that sucks too , but at least you 'll get the blood and guts you expect.<br /><br />The only reason I can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they 're supposed to . No artistic merit that I can comprehend , no reason for it 's notoriety , no nothing . Just a lame attempt to be shocking .
0 I recently watched the first Guinea Pig film , The Devil 's Experiment , and I must admit to being disappointed.<br /><br />This film is invariably included in any list of the " nastiest " films and maybe I was expecting more because of the hype . The truth is though , I do n't rate it.<br /><br />If I 'd been watching it believing the opening text to be true ( " I found this tape ... " ) , I might have been a bit disturbed by it , thinking it was real . Even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though , I think I 'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't.<br /><br />Throughout the film , the girl 's reactions to what is being done to her just are n't what they should be . She should be screaming like a banshee in pain . The fact that she is n't means that it 's obviously not real . I would n't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting , the film would be more disturbing.<br /><br />And then there are the notorious scenes : nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand . The hot oil , maggots and innards just did n't bother me . I 'm not saying I 'm " hard " ; just that I was n't able to suspend my disbelief , partly because of the girl 's inaction.<br /><br />The scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber . And the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more . I did n't want to look away and neither did I feel nauseous.<br /><br />Perhaps it 's because the film is twenty - odd years old , or perhaps I 'm just jaded . The truth is , I did n't find this film at all disturbing.<br /><br />It 's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters , story etc . and just leaving the torture , it works on some levels . As a disturbing piece of film though , it did n't work for me at least.<br /><br />I watched Guinea Pig with my wife , who is of the " it 's just a film " bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about . We got to discussing why I watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film . She said that she did n't think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that . I played her the fire extinguisher scene from Irreversible and she was indeed disturbed.<br /><br />I'm not sure I have a point , other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non - horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb .
0 I am an avid fan of violent exploitation cinema , who would never attack a film for being violent or disturbing . I consider " Cannibal Holocaust " a masterpiece and will always defend controversial films like " Day Of The Woman " or " Last House on the Left " as genuine classics . Anyone who browses through my other user comments will notice that I am actually very pro - violence / gore when it comes to films . However , I do think that there should be at least some point to the violence . This piece of crap does n't have any point whatsoever . The first film in the notorious " Guinea Pig " series , " The Devil 's Experiment " ( 1985 ) is widely controversial , but , as opposed to many other controversial films , this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for . I must say that , before seeing any of the Guniea - Pig films , I already had a feeling that I would hate this one , knowing what it was about . Due to its status as one of the most controversial films around , however , I decided I had to see it . I am very glad I did n't waste any money on this pile of crap , and I sure wish I had n't wasted my time with it either.<br /><br />This thing 's story ( I do n't even want to call it a ' film ' ) : It does n't have one . Three scumbags torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes . That 's it . There is no artistic value , no ' shocking ' story , no suspense ; nothing . Simply the disbelief that a film that shows NOTHING except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cult - following . It IS disturbing , I give it that . Of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes . What is more disturbing , however , is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece . I really can not figure why . The fact that the gore effects look realistic can not be the reason , I hope . The girl who plays the victim is n't a very good actor , and reacts very calm to all the torture . That makes the film look less realistic , which is , in this single case , a good thing . This is a film that is sickening ; not for its gore , but for its redundancy , its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture.<br /><br />I strongly oppose any form of censorship . Since this is 100 % fake and nobody got hurt during its production , it IS legitimate to make such a film . However , I can not think of a single reason why anyone would like this , other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture . This film 's sequel " Flowers of Flesh and Blood " gained notoriety when actor Charlie Sheen mistook it for an actual snuff film and informed the FBI . Fortuneately , the film turned out to be fake . Overall , " The Devil 's Experiment " is a fake torture / snuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible.<br /><br />"The Devil 's Experiment " is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through . Do n't torture yourself by giving this piece of crap a try for its controversial status . Do yourself a favor and avoid it . Zero stars out of 10 , I wish there was a negative scale in order to appropriately rate this pile of crap .
0 Well , how do you even rate a movie such as this one ? Does it even have cinematic value really ? It 's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible . Basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl . Not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really.<br /><br />It 's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible . However the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended . The slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking , as well as sounding . They are often just kicking into the floor , rather than into the girl , obviously . Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame . I mean if this was real , surely she would had screamed it out . There is more moaning than screaming in this one though.<br /><br />The movie is obviously low budget and it 's a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking , with very limited resources . Do n't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released , though it must had done something well , since a total of six sequels got released after this one.<br /><br />Fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie , though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie.<br /><br />4/10
0 C'mon people , you ca n't be serious , another case of advertising snuff when it totally is n't ! This is n't even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved - it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork , made for the next party to get the girls laid.<br /><br />The gore is incredibly bad , even the eye - scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head . The girl is just laying there rubber - faced , not moving at all . It would have been funnier to use a real doll instead.<br /><br />One season of " I 'm a Celebrity , Get Me Out of Here ! " is more frightening than this one . Do n't waste your time or your money .
0 this movie has no plot , no character development , and no budget . it really sucks to put it in short terms . Since there is no development for the movie , it really ca n't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture . Which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it . To be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak . Well it falls short here too . The girl 's reactions just seem dumb . it 's extremely easy to tell that it 's fake ( honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie . They throw innards on her , but she 's asleep for most of it , so it 's just kinda dumb . The only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye . But honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake , with the exception of the eye . if you want a good movie about torture , go watch Hostel and Hostel 2 . Not only do they both contain realistic violence , but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people . Plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like American fears of foreigners , issues of morality , testing how far a person can go , human instincts vs. civilization , and many other things . Plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story is n't focused on the violence . These are much better choices over this piece of crap
0 This movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time . After having just viewed it , I can say it does not live up to those claims.<br /><br />The idea of the movie is indeed demented . But overall , the execution was n't at all cringe worthy . Even the final scene ( the eyeball thing ) is n't really that nasty . I was expecting something insane , instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget Violent Sh!t.<br /><br />Any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed , since there is no story whatsoever ( though surely most people know this ) . Gore fans will be disappointed since , contrary to belief , the blood and guts here are few and far between . Not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.<br /><br />Regardless of what people say , this movie is n't that shocking , it just plain all out sucks . Avoid it .
0 I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment . I have to say that this movie , although having very good FX , better then I expected , was NOT a good movie . I honestly ca nt say that I enjoyed this movie at all . Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking , realistic , twisted 43 minutes of torture , but I found it to be very boring ( and not as gory as i hoped ) . And also I found that the torturers were very annoying , when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time , that ruined it even more ( and I m sure there 's some people out there who will agree with me on that one ) . I have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood . I wo nt say much more about Devils experiment , other than Great fx , descent acting from the girl , annoying fu**ing torturers , overall I give it 4 stars on account of the FX cos they are awesome .
0 A found tape about 3 ? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways.<br /><br />Yeah , spoiler.<br /><br />First of all , the acting made this short not scary at all , the woman seemed to have orgasms , not suffering . Some of the punishments were so ridiculous ! what 's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair ? If you are shooting a nonsense tape , at least make it good . The only part to remark is the end : the hammered hand and the pierced eye , the rest of the film is really poor . To end the boredom , the supposed story about the tape being investigated , extra bullshit .
0 I 've seen other Guinea Pig films , like Mermaid in a Manhole & He Never Dies , and while they 're pretty sick , they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them ( however dark ) . Devil 's Experiment though , is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there 's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever . It is n't remotely scary , except for perhaps the mind - set , but it 's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment . Now , I 'm not the paragon of good taste in films and I like my trash and sleaze , but this was too much for me , really . I 'm all for disturbing , in fact , I seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible , but this was a bit much . The young woman is kicked , beaten , submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools , and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere . If you think that sounds great , go for it , but it certainly put me off viewing any more Guinea Pig stuff . 1 out of 10 , absolutely nauseating .
0 This is an installment in the notorious Guinea Pig series . A short lived japanese TV - show , that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show . This short in the series is , like all the other films in the series , practically without any story . A group of guys have captured a young woman . They tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her . They beat her , pour boiling oil over her , use pliers on her and finally , in " loving " closeup , push a needle through her eye . This is the most straightforward of all the Guinea Pig movies , and one of the first . It was probably this film , more than any of the others , that gave Guinea Pig the rumour of being snuff . They certainly gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage 's movie " 8 mm . " . These movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles . They have progressed to more polished , but equally graphic movies like " Naked Blood " . They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies , that got slightly cleaned up and became reality TV . Not recommended , but will probably allure those who will see anything once , and wonder why afterwards , I know I did .
0 We have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie . Basically , Dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named Neweyes(which I needed after I watched this movie ) . Apparently , Neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that Dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation . The dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter(Too bad the screenwriters did n't have it ) . By the way , does it seem weird that out of ALL the wishes of the children in the world , Neweyes grants the wish of bringing Dinosaurs to modern times ? Why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine ? Disease ? War ? I mean come on ! Does n't Neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has ? ? ? Finally , when the Dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing , dancing and wrecking havoc(basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad LSD trip , I mean where else could you see a T - Rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of Spider - man ? ) . They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes ( ? ? ? ) makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract . Why ? Why would kids sign a blank contract ? ? ? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some ... "Brain - Drain " That he will let the children go . The dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil Screweyes limb from limb , give in and agree to his terms . What ? ! This is stupid ! They could have just menaced him , made him drop the contract , eaten it then walked off with the kids . I think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad , which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop Screweyes and apparently completely eat him . Oh yeah , that 's not violent at all ! We 're back makes no sense , it 's not fun , it 's goofy , it 's stupid , poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film . Even for a kid 's film ... this is BAD .
0 Children love dinosaurs . It 's somewhat part of their culture . But they 've got The Land Before Time . The original . At least that movie had heart . This . This movie is just plain pathetic . Just because kids love dinosaurs does n't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children . This movie has no plot , the whole premise is stupid , and it 's more by the numbers stuff . Not as soul sucking as Theodore Rex , but it 's lightyears away from being a Land Before Time .
0 When I was a kid , I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our " Uncle " Phil . We 're Back ! A Dinosaur 's Story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called Rex ( voiced by the wonderful John Goodman ) . He tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live . He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back , along with some friends . The Doctor / Professor villain of this film I think might have been responsible for them being them back , but I do n't care about him . The kids might like this , but personally it is just too cheesy . John Goodman was probably the only decent thing . Poor !
0 LOL ! Not a bad way to start it . I thought this was original , but then I discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of KING KONG . I never saw KING KONG until I was 15 . I saw this film when I was 9 . The film 's funky disco music will get stuck in your head ! Not to mention the film 's theme song by the Yetians . This is the worst creature effects I 've ever seen . At the same time this film remains a holy grail of B - movies . Memorable quotes : " Take a tranquilizer and go to bed . " " Put the Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power . " I remember seeing this film on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira . There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in reverse ! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and climbs up the building , but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl ( who was falling ) ! Also around that year was another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN ( 1977 ) which came from Hong Kong . There is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts . This film will leave you laughing . It is like I said , just another KING KONG clone . Rated PG for violence , language , thematic elements , and some scary scenes .
0 I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a Bernard Malamud story . This is basically a story of possible redemption , racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust.<br /><br />A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . If Morris Mishkin ( Zero Mostel ) will only believe in the angel ( Belafonte ) , his wife Fanny ( Ida Kaminska ) will recover . The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel.<br /><br />When he believes it , Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly . It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris.<br /><br />Jan Kadar , who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966 's " The Shop on Main Street " directs this film as well . Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really does n't convey the desperate situation that she faces . She keeps calling for Ruthie , their daughter , who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion . For most of the film , she does not realize the Angel 's appearance in her apartment.<br /><br />The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel 's girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment , is memorable but all too brief.<br /><br />We do n't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died.<br /><br />Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .
0 I watched this on the tube last night . The actor 's involved first caught my attention . The first scenes were attention getters . Some funny some sad . Good character development . I felt that the latter third of the film diverged . If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching . I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that it never happened . I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish ( ? ) . Was that the other shoe?<br /><br />Would I recommend ? No , I think not . As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated ( 60 's jive ) but it was not too distracting . The ending totally turned me off .
0 I absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end , after you 've already invested an hour into it . and that 's what happened with this film . i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story . I have n't gone to read that story but I can not imagine that it ends like this film ends . Fortunately i did n't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it . ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting ( the wife in particular was so perfect).but milo o'shea as a Jew ? ! ! ! ! now THAT was funny . I have n't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film . Before that point , a story and characters were developing , there were a number of neat plot points and there was n't too much time wasted . but ooh that last 1/2 hour- if that was n't the screwiest , most worthless denouement I 've ever witnessed , I do n't know what is . I just hate it when one 's faith is so destroyed like that ; it feels like an act of violence .
0 Somebody called Howard Koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for " Casablanca " , did n't he ? Or did n't he . Maybe there 's more than one Koch slinking around in Hollywood , and I 'm not too fond of " Casablanca " anyway . Wait a minute -- yes , there is another Howard Koch slinking around Hollwyood . That 's the one who wrote " Casablanca . " No matter . I 'll put as much care into this comment as " Howard W. Koch " put into this production , which is to say only a little.<br /><br />You know what this sounds like ? Somebody read Cliff 's Notes on Shakespeare 's " King Lear " and decided , since no original thoughts were aboard the Inbound Inspiration Express , to update it and Hollywoodize it with a happy ending.<br /><br />There are differences . Lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so , asks them how much they love him . Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money . The third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on Lear . But in the play , Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl . He winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors , putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating . Kids can do that to you . ( Take my kid , for instance . After all the effort I squandered on raising him , does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer ? No . ) In the end , everybody in the play dies.<br /><br />In the movie , evidently , the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself , somebody jumps in and saves her , so the ending is , more or less , happy . That 's the difference between Hollywood and a genuine tragedy , unless you define Hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself .
0 I found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that . The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions ( deliberate and otherwise ) effect the lives of the others . The film 's premise holds great promise but I feel it fails to deliver on its promise . Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it . As a result , I never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally . By the end of the movie , I had a " so what " attitude about all of them . A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great , but as it stands it is merely so - so
0 A missed train . A wrong phone number . An extra cup of coffee . What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision ? Most people do n't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions.<br /><br />"Happenstance " tells the story of the interrelations and cause - and - effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal Parisian folk . It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater , with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.<br /><br />There 's a cheating husband , an illegal immigrant , a classic slacker , a pickpocket , a crazy grandmother , an annoying girlfriend , a selfish roommate , and a homeless man . Audrey Tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist ( in the sense that she 's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film ) and normal girl who just ca n't seem to find the right rhythm in her life.<br /><br />She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her . What happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters . Does the prediction come true ? The concept is good , but the storytelling is flimsy . The connections from one event to the next are weak . There 's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of Happenstance.<br /><br />If you enjoy Audrey Tautou , then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film , but you 'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director .
0 Witty . Quirky . Genuine . Surreal . Butterfly wings ? One could ask what all of these words best describe , and some ( those in fuse with the international film community ) may quickly say Happenstance , but others may jump aboard the more American train and immediately yell , The Butterfly Effect . Strangely , I would be one of those screaming for that sci - fi Kutcher film mainly because none of those words that I initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the Tautou feature that I witnessed . Sure , we all loved her in Amelie and thought she was the daughter of Jesus in The Da Vinci Code , but in this film first - time director ( of a feature film at least ) Laurent Firode does n't give Tautou the opportunity to shine . Sadly , he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of " random chance " to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer ( never a true boil ) . Firode has ample , and I use " ample " as a small word , moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story , a genuinely whimsical fairy - tale of love and coincidence , but instead he fell face - first into a mud - bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.<br /><br />Tautou 's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box , but do not be so taken immediately as I did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into Tautou 's French cinema . Tautou is in this film , do not get me wrong , but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story . Firode 's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly ( albeit confusing ) ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing " melodrama " . He utterly , utterly fails . Firode fails by giving us , the audience , too many characters . With too many characters he gives us too many random interventions , and by the end you do n't really care who is who , or what is what , or how is how ; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival . Tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only Firode would have given her the center . Alas , he did not , but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny . It just did n't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.<br /><br />Firode fails because he focus ' so intently on the minor details that , for one of those rare film occurrences , he actually forgets the central focus . I can say that there was no defined central focus to Happenstance . In the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight , but we never go back to that throughout the film . Instead , again , we are bombarded with new characters , stuffy scenes , and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of " ifs , ands , and buts " . I could n't do it . I could n't believe this film . Writer Firode ( yes , the same guy directing this garbage ) uses a technique so primitive in this film that I immediately felt like ending it immediately . He must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline ( or the scientific premise ) because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks . I did n't need this , nor do I think Firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter . While there were other elements that just did n't seem to work for me at all ( again , felt like a jumbled Parisian collage of shredded paper ) , this was the icing on the cake . I do n't need my hand held through films.<br /><br />I will give this film one star for credit . This is a rather difficult genre to master successfully . Time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for , but with Happenstance it works because Firode semi - explores the different avenues . While I will counter with saying that he does not do it well , it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment . I liked where Firode was headed with this film , he had a genuinely diagramed story , but the final execution just blew this film to shreds . Firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters , while lightening up his premise and story . I think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken . Oh , how I only wish I could time travel back to the production of this film to show Firode the errors of his ways.<br /><br />Overall , for the first time ( and probably last ) , this was a Tautou film that I must say utterly disappointed me . From the choppy opening to the apathetic ending , I just felt that Happenstance failed due to Firode 's leadership and horrid marketing . Marketing is something that I did n't mention before , but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an Amelie 2 ( per the title released in Hong Kong ) , and why would you place Tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she was n't carrying this film at all . I believe that from the first minute that passed on my DVD player , this film was in shambles . While I will applaud his subject , everything else was well below the level of mediocrity . I can not suggest this film to anyone.<br /><br />Grade : * out of * * * * *
0 The movie has one nude scene : A man sitting on the edge of the bed , with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen . It is quite a long scene . What was the point ? I almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it was n't funny to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.<br /><br />The movie is cold . None of the characters are even likeable . Audrey Tatou is cute , of course , but her character is an unhappy girl.<br /><br />I really would not recommend this movie . I had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing . I wondered if the director was from a very upper crust , educated French family and he looks down on these characters.<br /><br / >
0 First of all , I 'd like to tell you that I 'm into comics , anime , animation and such stuff . It is true that everyone has his own preferences , but you can trust me on this movie . I 'll be objective . To begin with the story - it 's OK . Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I 'm familiar with them . But the animation ... Well , it 's not actually terrible , but it 's definitely cheap and mediocre . It would be a lot better if they did n't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings . If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more . Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985 . Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better ! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable , the music is nothing special . So all in all - it lacks atmosphere . I watched it , but I can not tell I really enjoyed it . It just does not capture you . There 's plenty of blood and violence , but that does not impress me at all . May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time ( is there anyone around ? ) , but I do n't think this is the audience for this movie . So they could add a little nudity and spice to it . The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty , and hell , we have Lady Death herself ! There are few sexy looks , but that 's not enough . Instead of Bill Brown 's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack . All in all - the movie is n't that bad , but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal , Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 , Ralph Bakshi 's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe . And of course - Vampire Hunter D : Bloodlust
0 Well , I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it . The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course . The story line was fallible and laughable , the characters were one - dimensional , the realism was out the window , and the animation was done by four - year olds . Does that cover it ? I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life . I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character , but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation.<br /><br />To begin , the story moved too quickly . For someone new to this character and situations , I needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution . I have seen other Anime ( if you could call this one an Anime ) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them . There was nothing set aside for Lady Death . In a few short scenes , we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive she - beast of Hell . This was hard for me to swallow , considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father . Suddenly , she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years . This was absurd . The presentation of Lady Death was poor , to say the least . I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind . For me , it just did n't work . She was nothing more than eye - candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with Cremator . Oh , I felt sick just watching her . The same goes for the character of Cremator . Who was this random person ? The explanation they gave was n't enough , and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development . It is a very sad day in Hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action , especially in an animated feature.<br /><br />Next , there was Lucifer himself . Let me just say that I think I could do battle with the King of Hell and survive . He was weak , his voice was laughable , and he just did n't represent the image that I had in my mind . It was as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him semi - PC . He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies . He was not the ruler of Hell , but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live . Speaking of living or dying , how can you die again in Hell ? That was a concept that definitely needed more explanation . Most of the characters were worrying about dying , when they did n't even consider the option that they were already dead . That is how they got to Hell . I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me . I did n't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in Hell , but that could just be me   or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story . There was nothing built , just preparing.<br /><br />The battle sequences were hysterically bad . The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s . There was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn . Why are we , America , so behind on animation ? It is huge in Asia , and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination . We are cheap , and this film shows it.<br /><br />Overall , this film was bad . The animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap . I had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time , which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card . The production was horrendous as well as the story . Nothing was developed , leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into . The strength of the characters was missing , and nothing was explained . I wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when Death does come , you do n't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.<br /><br />BLAH ! < br /><br />Grade : * out of * * * * *
0 I am a huge fan of the comic book series , but this movie fell way below my expectations . I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it ..... slow moving , bad dialogue , lots o ' blood ..... but this was worse than anything I could have imagined . < br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic , but the good points pretty much stop there . The characters do n't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series . The movie only covers a small portion of the comic , and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts . The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />With the right people working on this project , it could have been amazing . Sadly , it was n't that way , so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love . My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out .
0 And it falls squarely into the category of " awesomely bad " - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of . I was at the sci fi movie festival and all I remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered . Other critiques will better describe this movie 's fecal nature , and I felt oh - so - bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up , obviously to gauge the audience 's reaction . What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience , and after a " serious " anime movie , I think it was " sky blue " , the audience was in a sombre mood , and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles . I will bullet point the worst parts;<br /><br />Script : The funniest , and worst part of this movie , it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill - thought - out aside . Rubbish , but eminently laughable.<br /><br />Animation : Poorly done , and put together , if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine ( I know I can ! ) , then watch out for the montage where she " trasforms " from a Swedish peasant girl into LADY DEATH!!!<br /><br />Characters : So one - dimensional its painful , there is a brief backstory ( with side - splitting lines of dialogue ) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.<br /><br />So , in a nutshell , if you 've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around ( try and make sure they 're alcoholic to ease the pain ) , then slip this movie into the DVD and get in a " mystery science theatre 3000 " mindset . There is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it , and its not meant to be a comedy . DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE . It could possible be even more boring to watch solo than " New World " with Colin Farrell as you wo n't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two .
0 There 's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this , Lady Death : The Motion Picture just plain sucks . Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence , the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980 's cartoon based on a line of action figures . The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe , has the obligatory inept henchman , and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon . Just do n't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue . At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai , yet there is no sex , no tentacle rape ( Thank goodness ! ) and very little sex appeal , this despite the physical appearance of the title character . There is simply no adult edge to this material , unless you count the half - naked heroine and bloody deaths . Essentially , what we have here is a feature length episode of She - Ra , Princess of Power , but with skimpier clothes and more gore .
0 I also saw this amazingly bad piece of " anime " at the London Sci - Fi Festival . If you HAVE to watch this thing , do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers , you may then glean some enjoyment from it . < br /><br />I found the dialogue hilarious , lodged in my mind is the introduction of Cremator . The animation is awful . It is badly designed and badly executed . It may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.<br /><br />There 's nothing else to say really , this film is a failure on every level .
0 This movie was a great disappointment for me . I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years , and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt . Not only did they cut out half the story line , but they altered information . The statement that Lucifer is Hope 's Father is untrue . He did corrupt her father , but he himself is not her father . The voices also did not suit the characters , and once you hear the voice of a beloved character , the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned . I can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong . The bottom line is if you love Lady Death do not watch this movie . It just did not do the comic justice at all ! !
0 Oh my GOD this was so bad ! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish . This film takes itself far too seriously ... unless of course they meant to be funny . I saw this last week at the London Sci - Fi Festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene . I think my favourite was ' should n't you be studying medicine at Oopsalof ' ! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character Nicalo 's only line ' we will be together ... it is our destiny . ' I 'm sorry but after the first time , the words lost all meaning.<br /><br />And what was with the apple?<br /><br />I recommend this as a lesson to Americans : You can not animate , so please do n't try . You only embarrass yourselves .
0 I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language . ( Not ' dialect ' as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as . As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other . ) But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie . Being a Canadian , of Cebuano parents , I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film . I was further excited to hear that it was n't another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies . But alas , I was short - changed.<br /><br />Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano . Montano of course plays the hero of the movie . And when I say ' hero ' I mean in the most stereotypical of manners ; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bol - anons to victory against the Japanese . His character has no depth or complexity . He just fits the hero mold . The rest of the characters are one dimensional ; they all fit their cookie cutter roles.<br /><br />I'm all for slow - moving / meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving . It did n't really meditate on anything . Just because a movie is historically - themed , a drama and slow - moving does n't make it a well - made film.<br /><br />Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony . His performance was embarrassing.<br /><br />If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry he should have really thought this through . He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete at Cannes and Toronto etc . but really , this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals . To get Visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences , even if it meant sacrificing quality . Obviously he did n't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at Cannes so an audience - attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door.<br /><br />I'm afraid now that Visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie . If ever I said to a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan movies of course I 'd get an answer like , " Visayans do n't make good movies . Did n't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba ? " Of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see.<br /><br />An example of movies that are meditative , not just slow moving , are the Tagalog film Blackout or David Lynch 's The Straight Story . I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non - Tagalog Filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie . These movies rely heavily on what Hitchcock called ' pure cinema ' . Images without words are used to convey the story . But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie . and they do it very well . Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood.<br /><br />And what 's with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ? ? ?
0 I notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the MST3 K airing . That 's fair enough ( that is , after all , how it got its widest exposure ) , but , having had the misfortune of seeing " Final Justice " in its original form , I 'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version.<br /><br />First off , it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3 K broadcast , owing primarily to an expository scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini ( I COULD use the characters ' names instead of the actors ' , but I just love typing the words " Venantino Venantini " ) , explaining why Venantini 's fugitive character ca n't just leave Malta right away . ( It 's not a very CONVINCING plot point , but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it . ) Whether this scene was cut just for time or because it did n't provide much fodder for riffs , I do n't know.<br /><br />Another plot point missing in the original : The stripper 's betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker , seemingly unmotivated in the MST3 K version , is explained by an earlier , extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower . While this does give her a motive for turning against him , the whole scenario is just really ... icky . ( There 's no other word for it.)<br /><br />Some of the MST - worthy moments ( the perpetual truncated shouts of " Son of a-- " and the " deja vu " shooting of the sheriff ) were purely the result of the edited - for - TV print they worked with , and were absent from the original movie.<br /><br />One scene I wish had made it into the MST3 K version : Before entering the bar to question some people , Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside , because " they see that uniform , they wo n't cooperate . " However , Joe Don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy - slash - sheriff outfit , complete with shiny badge ! I ca n't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him ... <br /><br />One final observation on the original , uncut version of " Final Justice " : Why , oh why , did they feel the need to put Venantino Venantini 's naked butt up on the screen ?
0 While not as bad as it has been made to be ( I have seen MUCH worse ) , this is still a very lame movie . Basically a rehash of Siegel 's " Coogan 's Bluff " , with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood 's hat has more charisma than the whole of Joe Don Baker , an unappealing actor if there was one.<br /><br />However , Venantino Venantini is great ( and great fun ) as the bad guy , sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman . He is the main reason to sit through this steampile , as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting , specially the girl . Poor old Rossano Brazzi , hard to believe he was once a romantic lead ( watch " Mondo Cane " to see him running away from women ) . Looking here like a second - tier Ben Gazzara , he 's given next to nothing to do . It 's all Joe Don 's show , unfortunately . And all of it scored to generic 80 's " action movie " music that could n't be more boring.<br /><br />Greydon Clark can make good B - Movies ( " Without Warning " ) , but here he trips , falls , breaks his nose and loses three teeth . Well , at least the Malta locations were nice , and there 's Venantini to try to save the day . 3/10 .
0 Human pot roast Joe Don Baker ( MITCHELL ) stars in this dull , unremarkable ` action ' movie as Deputy Geronimo , a fat , gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit , listening to country music and eating too many donuts . Meanwhile , a vaguely criminal guy named Palermo ( played by the guy who owned the drill in Fulci 's GATES OF HELL ) stumbles into Joe Don 's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene . Joe Don- slowly- gives chase and offs Palermo 's brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase ` It 's your move . Think you can take me ? Well , go ahead on ' . For some reason Joe Don , a Texas lawman , must transport Palermo to Italy ( ` Mr . Palermo 's been a major source of embarrassment to the Italian government , ' says Mr. Wilson , another vague character played by Bill McKinney , who was in MASTER NINJA 1 , SHE FREAK , and a lot of good Clint Eastwood movies ) . < br /><br />Anyhoo , Joe Don 's plane must land on the island of Malta , where Palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz . And that 's where the movie grinds to a halt . For the rest of the movie , Joe Don looks for Palermo , looses Palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the Malta chief of police , and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more . Then Joe Don keeps looking for Palermo , looses Palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the Malta chief of police , and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more . Then Joe Don looks for Palermo , looses Palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the Malta chief of police , and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more . This is one aggravating movie.<br /><br />At one point Joe Don is thought to be dead at sea . All the other characters wonder if he 's dead or not , finally concluding that he is . But then he shows up ( he was rescued by a poor family ) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days . Even his cute , Julia Louise - Dreyfuss - esque sidekick does n't welcome him back . She does , however , offer to help him find Palermo , so Joe Don looks for Palermo , looses Palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the Malta chief of police , and then let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more.<br /><br />Highpoints include , a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats , some sexy strippers , a shoot out involving a kid dressed like Napoleon AND a cart of tomatoes , a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk , and any scene without Joe Don . Lowpoints include Joe Don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger.<br /><br />It should be noted that this is from Greydon Clark , director of ANGEL 'S REVENGE , who appears as the sheriff . Ick!<br /><br / >
0 If you ever hear these three words uttered to you ... "Joe Don Baker " , be afraid ... <br /><br />Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas town named Geronimo ( pronounced as Heronimo ) . He 's an ugly , slimy , rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas . His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie . Very bad editing . Joe Don Baker ( Geronimo ) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie , making the plot go nowhere fast . Plus , he shoots everybody like he 's in the wild west . I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century . A woman cop is assigned to show him around Malta ( who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld ) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck . She must be insane!<br /><br />The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie . Their dancing is shown throughout the film and I began to bond with the sleazy women . Well , at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to dumb his way out of something . The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable , and I was happy it was finally over . You 'll never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie.<br /><br />It 's so hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond movies ... very weird ! Anyway , if you 're up for a laugh , then see this one on MST3 K sometime . Also , I 've heard his other bad movie ( among many ) , " Mitchell " MST3 K version is being released on DVD by Rhino . I ca n't wait to see that !
0 Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there ... he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies . One thing he ca n't do is carry a movie as the lead , which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta . Joe Don 's partner is killed so he kills the killer 's brother and escorts the killer to Italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away . The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there , Joe Don getting taken into custody various times , Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on . The movie is quite bad and you wo n't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don 's character . You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be . The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta . This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever .
0 Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo , a pudgy , sweaty murderous oaf in a stupid cowboy suit that Roy Rogers would have laughed at . Somehow he still has a badge , probably because he lives in Texas and they 'll let ANYTHING be law enforcement there.<br /><br />This greasy loser is a deputy sheriff near the Texas border . Not surprisingly , he was once a Texas Ranger but got kicked out because he seemed to think that the law was his own personal bouncing ball to be played with at his discretion . This includes shooting suspects who are over the international border into Mexico , beating up on suspects , cheating in gun fights , threatening women , starting gunfights that could have been avoided AND managing to get the life of a child threatened in the process , letting women he promised he would help and protect get killed just so that he could get out of jail , etc , etc . This guy makes L.A. cops look like saints in comparison.<br /><br />When his partner is killed by a pair of wandering Italian assassins , Joe Don 's character hunts them down and kills one of them . Then he takes the other to Italy at the behest of a Mr. Wilson , who rightly thinks that Joe Don will screw up big time . In record time , he loses the Italian and gets a Maltese cabby blown up in the process . This is just the first of the many deaths and major destruction that Joe Don leaves in a trail behind him as he rampages across Malta looking for Palermo(the Italian assassin).<br /><br />Thus begins the mobius strip part of the movie , in which our hero gets arrested , lectured by the Maltese chief of police , goes out and causes more trouble , gets arrested , gets lectured by the chief of police ... and so on , and so on . Until you want to blow your brains out with Joe Don 's ivory handled pistol and be done with the horror.<br /><br />Joe Don proves his uselessness not just in the first time Palermo escapes , but in the subsequent boat chase in which he goes down in just one punch . Then he gets taken by Palermo after he threatens a woman with a coat hanger . You hope that Palermo will actually get to torture him in the basement cell he 's put in , but no - the stripper he threatened came and got him out , because he promised to protect her . Her throat promptly gets cut(big surprise ) and Joe Don escapes into the night.<br /><br />And here you hope he might have been drowned in the ( yet another ) boat chase . But even the ocean does n't want him , and spits him up on a shore where he 's nursed by a poor Maltese family(what did they ever do to deserve that ? ) he returns to the city , where he 's arrested by the police , lectured by the police chief ... arrrgghhh ! The female police officer who 's been escorting him around frees him so that they can go get Palermo . Why she would do anything so brain dead as to destroy her career for this great slob is beyond me . It 's just head scratchily puzzling.<br /><br />They go out to the villa where Palermo is hiding , and start a shoot out . Joe Don blithely cheats , and kills Palermo . He then utters the great and dazzling last line of the movie : " The big one has my badge . Can you go get it for me ? " Thank you for that immortal line , Mr. Baker . That will go down in the annals of movie history as the most literate , amazing , wondrous last line ever uttered by a character in a film . It certainly falls into line with everything else about the character . Bravo .
0 Geez ! This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you did n't . I mean , you did n't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind.<br /><br />To be honest and brief ; this is one of the worst , boring , and stupid slashers ever made . I ca n't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it 's made by professional film makers.<br /><br />The death scenes are horrible , bloodless , stupid . The plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied " Popcorn " from 1991.<br /><br />To make things even worse , this is n't a movie so bad that it 's good . It 's just plain bad.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it was n't enough .
0 Cut tries to be like most post - Scream slashers tried to be , a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies . Now , I am not bagging ' Scream , ' as I think ' Scream ' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy . Cut fails on most levels . It has its moments but overall it just does not work out , not even as a " so bad it 's good " movie , just a below average one.<br /><br />The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story fairly well , apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue ca n't really act , and ironically she gets her tongue out , go figure . Go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off , which is apparently cursed . And , as you have probably predicted , one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.<br /><br />Unoriginal plot , poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow . There is plenty of referencing in the film , everything from ' Scream ' to ' The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . ' This is n't smart either , it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala Scream . For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity , which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it . Really , I should be supporting this movie because I 'm Australian and we 're not as good when it comes to horror ( we do have our gems , though ) but Cut is definitely not one of them.<br /><br />However , it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so , so that is something good at least . I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans , who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for , but if you are looking for a good movie , stay away.<br /><br />2/5
0 It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here 's a review without pretensions:<br /><br />Just when you think nothing is going to happen , it doesn't.<br /><br />Dress it up any way you like , this is a dull film , full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest.<br /><br />One to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you 're like , so deep , man.<br /><br />Not something to watch for your own pleasure though.<br /><br />Unless.<br /><br />You're.<br /><br />Pretentious .
0 I opted to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it had been selected to the Cannes film festival 's prestigious Competition section . I was surprised that Cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.<br /><br />The film , some reviewers , have noted does not have too much of gunfire -- but the inherent violence is repulsive . Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your young son .. or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty . There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copolla 's " Godfather " that seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.<br /><br />This film is only recommended for violence junkies .. there is no great cinema here . At best it might be considered to be better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values .
0 Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns . He was a great actor , From Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden arm are a proof of that , but he did not have the physique of a western hero , you identified him as an urban guy . But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho , the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault . I blame it on two factors : a ) the story was too unusual , specially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie . In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern , to break away from it the film has to be very good . b ) the story is not convincing , it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother . Also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible , why all the gunfighters have not adopted it ? I think that this film should not have been withdrawn , because any film with Sinatra is worth seeing , and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
0 Someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to High Noon . Now that is a real stretch ! I 'm a big Sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been Don Knotts . First off , as someone pointed out , Sinatra just does n't have the build for a Western bad - guy wannabe . He 's just too ' slight ' at this point in his life . Maybe he was about the same height as say Audie Murphy , but Murphy had a pretty solid build . Sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously.<br /><br />The story is uninspired and really not credible . I do n't want to spoil it but I think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story does n't make any sense . Another thing , these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some ' bad guy ' . This is just a little town , so I do n't get the attraction nor do I understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way.<br /><br />There is a ' love interest ' in the story and if I followed it right , she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy would n't kill him . Now there 's true love for you . ' Stand up for yourself ! Tell him your name so he will kill you ! ' LOL . Stop , you 're killing me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the basic premise of the movie is n't good enough and no matter how they tried this story did n't have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket . Want to know why it 's not on video and never shown on TV ? The critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad . I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible.<br /><br />You want to see a good Western where a town stands up against a bad guy ? Try Tension at Table Rock , or At Gunpoint - two really , really good Westerns with that theme . Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko . Frank , you were the greatest singer ever - but you did n't belong in a movie like this .
0 Mercifully , there 's no video of this wannabe western that a stay - afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering . The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back - room writer . All in all , this show stinks . The story is basically boring , ill - conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence . I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it " ... underrated ... " The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so . You 'll have to catch it on the last show , if you up late and having a bout of insomnia . But , if you can sit through it , you 've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends .
0 I checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 7.2 or something , but seriously this is a horrible movie . Lets break it down . The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand - held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college . the next thing you 'll notice is that the actors , are all friends of said freshman ( he probably met them at the pub the night before . Third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible , and they try to cram many songs into this movie , at 30 second intervals ... also all digital editing is done on said freshman 's home PC ... probably using windows movie maker . This movie was horrible ... pretentious , had an undeniably bad script , and acting that followed suit . I would n't recommend this movie to anyone I know , but I do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity .
0 This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I 've ever seen . It 's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline . This movie is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes . While the acting is mediocre at best , the biggest problem is the script , which is poorly written , slow and plodding with no real direction . Occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event . I 'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots , they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script . As a huge fan of good horror movies , I 'm always irritated that something this bad gets made . Save yourself 98 minutes you 'll never get back .
0 This film on paper looked like it could possibly be good , after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible ! ! The plot has no meaning , and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous . I watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the SCARINESS of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music , what they would call tragic music , they play opera i mean be serious ! ! This film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film . To be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish , ENJOY ! !
0 When the young Kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift , he invites five friends of him to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend . While in the journey , they drink booze , have sex and play games , with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear . Later Kevin drowns in the open sea , the engine stops , and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear.<br /><br />Yesterday , my wife , son , daughter and three other friends joined to watch " Haunted Boat " on DVD . With less than 30 minutes running time , the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap , and we decided to see another film . Later , I decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep . The confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work , with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school . The terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end , actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about . Was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat , imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends ? If that is true , are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness ? My vote is one.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Viagem Para a Morte " ( " Trip to the Death " )
0 This is by far the worst movie I 've ever seen . From the plot , though the shots , the " special effects " , the acting , and did I mentioned the plot ? Every single thing in it sucked ass!<br /><br />This is a good example of what " over - doing " means and I 'll try to explain:<br /><br />I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do ; this was supposed to be one of those movies you ca n't really tell what the hell is going on up until the end . You sit mesmerized , not knowing who 's dead and who 's alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out you 're wrong and the movie ends - leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes ! Something like " Unbreakable " or " The Job " if you know what I mean.<br /><br />But Olga Levens , the writer of this junk , yes , Olga  The writer , Director , Producer , Screenplay author , Caster , Production designer , Art Director , Costume Designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes ... this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to Olga Levens from " Levens Productions " you ca n't go wrong : -)<br /><br />Well this might come as a shocker but " this time " Olga over did this big time , jumping from scene to scene , from dreams to reality ... but wait ! this was all a dream after all ... or was it ? ? ? The picture fades and I realized none of this ever happened , the girl was all alone on the ship ... actually there was no ship ... no wait ! There 's the ship again , and the guys ! They 're alive ! Thank god ! No they 're calling her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears so maybe they 're dead after all ? ? ? or maybe they never were alive to begin with???<br /><br />If you understood what I just said you might like this movie - otherwise it 's a boring piece of work and the only reason I set through this entire crap is to find out how the hell can they finish this movie ... <br /><br />Don't watch this if you value time , ever 90 minutes are a waste in this case ...
0 I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers . Even the cover of the DVD looked good . As soon as I started watching it I was thinking like others " oh my God what s this".There were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music . There was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes . That right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn I wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the cover art . Nothing against the music itself , it was just in the wrong parts of the movie . Whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing . The cover showed lightning , implying they were caught in a storm at sea . That would have been more interesting but it did n't happen . The acting was n't the worst i 've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first film . Another reason I was disappointed was the plot made no sense . In the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boat , then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts i 'm not sure because it was very badly portrayed . WhyteFox who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true story . He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmed . There was no mention in this movie about it being a true story . I have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying it 's impossible . I guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie , do it at your own risk . If you like amateur student horror films you may like this .
0 I rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me . However as soon as the film began I had regrets . It seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it . They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing , i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it.<br /><br />As for the plot I felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed . It had no direction.<br /><br />I did n't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on . Definitely 98minutes of my life wasted.<br /><br />I would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched ' Haunted Boat ' and find something that is more entertaining . I 'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after ' Terror Toons ' but this made me reconsider . A let down to its genre.<br /><br / > * out of * * * * * ( The star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them )
0 What the heck was this . Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester . We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror . There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music , CGI , or acting.<br /><br />The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy . Even David Lynch 's work feels like that at times , and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long . And sadly this is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />The cast was attractive , and that is about the limit to this . I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have , but just does n't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates ... whatever they were . The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous .
0 do not ever watch this film ... it is the biggest pile of sh*te i have ever come across in my whole life . and that s saying something . the acting , storyline and filming were absolutely dire this is THE WORST FILM IN THE WORLD ! ! ! seriously does n't it even give you a hit seeing as it cost my 99p from sainsburys and it was only made in 2005 ? hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... although if u really wanna watch it you got ta watch the " scary shark scene" ... possibly the best piece of acting i have seen in my life ... ha ha . i mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours EVER ! !
0 * * * * * probably minor spoilers******<br /><br />I ca nt say i liked it , but i ca nt say i didn't ... its very strange . It has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine , if i was the director i would cut that part for sure , gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie ... For some people it will be boring cause it lacks action , feels home made sometimes ... Take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what ? nop , not crying ... their telling horror stories to each other .. *sighs*(just after crying for he s lost)<br /><br />Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like " hundreds " of candles in the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtains(old rags covering the windows ) and sofas / Couches ... i thought it was dumb , using candles but not thinking about the surroundings , besides being in high sea alone ... <br /><br />The good , some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some . Sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of , so this movie does it good , maybe because its a low budget i do n't know , but it works fine for me ! You will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones i mentioned above.<br /><br />Do not expect much of it ! but if you like anykind of movie watch this one , be patient , try to enjoy .. lol < br /><br />(sorry about my raw English ) = ) < br /><br />Cheers
0 Haunted Boat sells itself as ' The Fog ' meets ' Open Water ' . In many ways this is accurate . There are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested.<br /><br />However the acting ability is poor at best . Showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film . Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability . When you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects , with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on.<br /><br />Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange . But it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused . In terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well . Ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end , you actually want to know what is going on . And are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax.<br /><br />This is no Ghost Ship but it 'll definitely do for an evening in front of the T.V.
0 I saw this film yesterday . I must admit , it were n't my cup of tea . Although it 's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind . But as I was watching this , I was thinking .. ' This movie is n't making any sense at all .. ' Where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from ? Where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind ? Where on earth did a shark came out from?<br /><br />All these elements in this film somehow did n't add up . I felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap.<br /><br />I've seen many good horror movies in my time , but this is one of the most worst horror flicks I 've seen . At the end of the movie , I said to myself that I would n't watch it again .. So much pappy show in this film , I 've decided to give it the thumbs down ! Count me out on this one ! 0 out of 10 !
0 A girl is showering unknowing that a serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight . Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone is hot on his trail , but not hot enough as they find him after he kills , rapes , and eats a nipple of the girl . He 's the shot to death . One would hope that this would be the end of the film . Not because it 's too horrifying , but because the level of acting is atrociously horrid . Sadly it 's not the end and months later the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a coven of satanists . So he continues where he left off , with the detectives on the case again , this time a flying baby is after him too ( do n't ask ) . There has been VERY good VERY low - budget movies ( Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring to mind ) , but this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel . Horrible acting , crappy dime store special effects , lame attempt at comedy and oh yeah , and the ending sucks too.<br /><br />My Grade : F < br /><br />Eye Candy : Theresa Bestul gets fully nude ; Anne R. Key gets topless
0 I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations . I think I paid about 50 $ for this movie . As an eternal fan of horror , from cheesy 80s American slashers to European zombie films , I told myself this was going to be great ! I ca n't tell you how wrong I was . First of all , I thought it was gon na be pretty much gorier than it actually is . After all I 've had heard about this film , I was almost scared to watch it . The murders are boring . The acting ... forget it , there 's no acting ! The story , even if we do n't care , is incredibly bad . It seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls , but unfortunately in this case it does n't help the movie . Why ? There 's no atmosphere , and this is the worst thing about this flick . It 's just bad film - making from point A to B. Though it 's extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers , do n't make any effort to get your hands on it . There are so many movies in this world , do n't waste your time watching Necro Files !
0 I am a huge horror / splatter fan , I even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid . I also like gore . The more the merrier as long as it has a point.<br /><br />After reading the other people 's reviews on the site I was sure this film was going to be a little gem . But much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films I 've ever watched.<br /><br />The acting was terrible , the dialogs were stupid , the plot was pointless , the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years . Usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie . But not in this case.<br /><br />I waisted 11 EUR to get this DVD . < br /><br />Unless you actually enjoy pointless gore ( for example the " violent sh*t " films ) avoid at any cost !
0 It is such a strange movie , you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh - athon . Strange comes to mind again and again . Shot amateurishly , acted even worse and the directions , maybe none . The special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit . See it if you got time to kill . But do n't , do n't even try to take it seriously . Supposed to be a tribute to ' Porno holocaust ' , . Since I have n't seen it , from the tribute I can assume it to be as bad . Should have given it 1/10 , but it did give me a good laugh or two , so it gets a 3 . Excessive gore , the only thing somebody worked on . Stay away if you are squeamish , more gore than laughs . Wonder if the makers had a laugh making it ?
0 A killer , cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder . At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave . This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look . The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem , are back on the case . Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing . Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection . Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film . The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out . Now I 'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible . If it was n't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep . There is a bit of gore but it 's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims . The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times . There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll . The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film . It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.<br /><br />The ending is extremely bad . You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does . God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel . < br /><br />4/10
0 This is not as funny and gory as the DVD box claims . I really love twisted and wierd movies , but this one is really just dull ! It 's one hour of ripped off penises , flying Baby Born dolls and a lot of rape ! I think the intention with this amateur sleaze , was to make a It's - so - bad - it's - good movies , but it fails . It 's just bad ! A few scenes are ok , but in whole it 's a mess . If you like amateur splatter like this one ( Only way better ) I would recommend Andreas Schnass ' Violent Shit 2 and 3 .
0 A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman . He 's been shot by two policemen and then he is risen from the grave because of some sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy . The hunting of women continues by this zombie - demon . The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again , but only with the help of the police this will come true ... <br /><br />A bloody 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies , doll - babies , S&M , corrupted and twisted policemen , repented heretics who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three text - screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived ( yes , we ought to know ! ) ... Two decent disemboweling shots ca n't save the situation . I 've seen worst horror - flicks , but this one was pretty bad too . Recommended only for the die - very - hard fans of the genre .
0 i got a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek . I have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act , but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to august 's underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie . Its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends . Reminds me of troma but good stuff . I recommend seeing this under two conditions , if you are bored and need a good laugh , or high , otherwise just let it be . Recommended download for sure . o and the killings are pretty funny . like when the zombie rips the Satan worshipers dick off and stabs someone in the head with it .
0 Well , if it were n't for Ethel Waters and a 7-year - old Sammy Davis , Jr. ( here billed without the Jr. ) , Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of African - American stereotypes I 've seen from the early talkie era and would n't have been worth seeing because of that . Ms. Waters is excellent here singing " Am I Blue ? " and " Underneath Our Harlem Moon " while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult . He 's so good tap - dancing here that for awhile I thought he was a little person with decades of experience . So if you 're willing to ignore the negative connotations here , Rufus Jones for President should provide some good enjoyment . P.S. This marks the fourth time today I 've seen and heard the song , " I 'll Be Glad When You 're Dead You Rascal You " performed on film , this time by Davis . Must have been a very popular song about this time .
0 This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely African - American cast . Every derogatory , disparaging stereotype of the black American community is featured prominently . I wo n't reinforce the insults by listing them here , except to mention chickens , watermelons , and dice.<br /><br />One good song by Ethel Waters ( and a couple of bad ones ) , and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year - old Sammy Davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the IMDb scale .
0 Being a fan of the manga and anime of Go Nagai ( DEVIL MAN , DEVIL LADY , VIOLENCE JACK , etc . ) , I was looking forward to this one . I 'd seen neither the manga nor the anime , so I had no preconceived notions going in . Good thing , too . What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night . While it 's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers ( our hero 's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued - on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect ) , there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies . While I have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes , I do dislike amateurishly made movies ( there are at least four in this series ) . On the plus side , there 's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw . It 's no wonder Nagai 's TESTICLE BOY never made it ...
0 I 'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script . This is easily THE WORST sequel EVER made.<br /><br />They KILLED Navin Johnson . Not only was Mark Blankfield 's performance GOD - AWFUL , so was everyone elses ! ! The physical comedy was forced , flat and predictable . The script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci . How the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me . They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talent - less buffoon . Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself.<br /><br />I want the 96 minutes of my life I spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so I can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity .
0 You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster . The question is not , " How did it get made , " because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film , they will do so.<br /><br />No . The question is " Why , oh why , did Steve Martin allow it to be made ? " I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything . He knew the sequel was going to be so frightful , that out of pride , he would n't even count it 's royalties as income . < br /><br />The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation 's favorite poor black family.<br /><br />And " dcreasy2001 " ( aka Mark Blankfield ? ) : It 's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity , and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel 's lone cheerleader as an IMDb user comment . I was praying for you to veer over into satire , but alas , you were really making an effort at spin . Why not 10 stars ?
0 This is a typical 70 's soft core sex romp in the Russ Meyer genre , though perhaps less outlandish than some of Meyer 's work . This film has higher ' production values ' than many of it 's contemporaries , suggesting a larger budget . It 's plot , writing and acting are straight out the B zone , though . Of late , this film has become a mainstay of B movie channels ( such as " Drive In Classics " ) in the 500 channel universe . If soft core is what you are in the mood for , this is as " good " as anything else in the B range . Do n't expect Polanski though , Sarno is just Sarno . Nothing more , nothing less . Jennifer Welles performance as the " mother " is perhaps the best of the cast . None of the actors in the film went on to greater fame , unsurprisingly . Confessions of a Young American Housewife is far from the worst example of it 's kind . It is watchable , if this is your type of film . 30 years ago , this would have been an avant garde and riske film . You can see more or less the same kind of thing on Showtime / HBO series these days , and in prime time .
0 Oh dear , Oh dear . I started watching this not knowing what to expect . I could n't believe what I was seeing . There were times when I thought it was a comedy . I loved how the government 's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man , who is unarmed , and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack . If only it were really that easy . I 've finally found a movie worse than " Plan 9 From Outer Space " .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * The Works * * * * Just Misses the Mark * * * That Little Bit In Between * * Lagging Behind * The Pits < br /><br />Some plutonium 's gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction- so Josh McCord ( Chuck Norris ) and his cocky young protégé Deke ( Judson Mills , a different actor from the previous film ) with the assistance of Josh 's adopted daughter Que ( Jennifer Tung ) set out to stop them.<br /><br />This was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 9/11 . Filmed in 2001 , Norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown New York that day , so there 'd have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where Norris and his side - kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else . Other than that , it 's as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been in . It makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place , and whether if this one could get made a President 's Man 3 might come out sometime soon.<br /><br />If you 've seen one Norris film , you 've really seen them all and there 's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one , but at least you know what you 're getting and , like I said , it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam . * *
0 I saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening . It really is the perfect time for this one . I have never , EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes . If you want to see a thrilling action movie , do n't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through . However , if you want a good laugh , please watch it ! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night . What especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copy - pasted from a Discovery documentary or an old TV - special on the US Army . Furthermore I was amazed by the fact that they did n't put the slightest effort in making the production look real . Afghanistan is , as far as I can remember , nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand - castle with his jet - pack and is taken away by a submarine ( probably Discovery ) . Later on in the movie , Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall . In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall . Got ta love it . I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though , only then you 'll understand why I 've been mad enough to spend 6,99 euro 's on the box .
0 OK , so , Chuck Norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced . I have one question - why ? Who read this script and said , " Sound 's great ! Original ! " This movie is regurgitated crap that I would n't tarnish my toilet bowel with . Of course it is another story , following in the tradition of MIA , Invasion USA , Walker , Texas Ranger , Delta Force and so on in which Chuck Norris , of course , is the one man who can same America from some bad guys . He does n't even need a gun most times . It 's stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind . Big surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris film 's is Chuck 's son Eric . Eric Norris has primarily worked on all his father 's films and TV shows . Does n't this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent ? Afterall , he 's directing the same people as before in the same stories as before ... only difference is the characters ' names . If this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the USA , than our country is in much worse shape than I ever imagined . Hopefully , this will be the nail in Chuck Norris 's acting coffin .
0 * * * THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILER(S ) * * * < br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Chuck Norris as an actor , but I worship him in all other ways . He also have his own fan web site with " Chuck Norris facts " that is really entertaining . But this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those " facts " into one movie . I really do n't remember when I wasted my time more than with this " action " . I do n't know what 's the worst this movie can offer you : unoriginal and thousand - times - made plot of terrorists who are trying to nuke US by smuggling nuke on US soil or perhaps that " great " dialogs and Chucks words of wisdom about life and everything else . Someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak English in everyday life . It 's a never ending list of crap . Not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film , that is kinda annoying . The chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is : Chuck Norris , of course . NO ONE else in America is not smart enough to see that ! And the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous . One man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp UNARMED ( I 'm lying , he had a KNIFE ) , escapes his stalkers with JET PACK and then para glides for few hundred , maybe even thousand kilometers to nearest shore ( Afganistan border is 450 km far away from nearest shore ) , where he is rescued by submarine . I hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good , but that 's even more funny than the plot . If you did n't know , 85 % of terrorist are masters of some martial art , but Chuck and CO beat the sh*t out of them . Not only they kill them easily , they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few meters like dolls . You may ask me did I watch this movie to the end ? I did . Why ? Because I just wanted to see who , of these two super heroes , will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a MICROWAVE . And then I realized what fool I am . Of course , it 's Chuck 's movie after all . And not only he singlehandedly defuse nuke with tweezers , but he do it - TWICE ! ! I could write a book about all the stupid things in this movie , but I would spend my life spawn.<br /><br />So , makers of this movie made another Chuck Norris fact to be added on his web site : Can Chuck Norris defuse nuclear bomb ? Yes and he can do it twice !
0 Wow , my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted . I will try to tone this one down . Lets be real ! ! ! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character . There was a good fight scene at the end , but the rest of the movie stank . I have to wonder if old Chuck just ca n't hang with the best any more . Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie ? Chuck is an awesome martial artist , and as we have seen from Walker , Texas Ranger , a fairly good actor , but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies , and this one does not . Very Disappointing for us Norris fans . Chuck , stay as the main character in your movies , because this does not work for you ... Gary
0 Too bad Chuck Norris has gone to TV . He made some good movies before he hit TV . This is a typical TV movie intended to pass the time . Unfortunately it wastes Chuck 's talent as an actor . I hope he returns to the big screen some day .
0 In the standard view , this is a purely awful movie . However , it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale . I can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as I did watching this movie . Andy Griffith 's ghost dressed in Native American garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime . I would n't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it , but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on TV , check it out .
0 This is just horrible , really horrible trash . Yes , we 've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex . But while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a " film " with actual things to say , with real emotion and struggle . It is n't . It 's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time . I 'm sure all of these women ( and men ) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s . . . but not in the actual movie business.<br /><br />The acting was hackneyed , so bad , I mean real terrible . The writing was even worse . I ca n't lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with . The very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors . The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar , as a sniper . These shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough . If there was more writing - better writing , much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with.<br /><br />This movie should have been shot , made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along ; it would have made more money . It practically is a hardcore porn film already , and it remains the only non - porn movie I 've seen that shows a male erect penis .
0 1st watched 12/26/2008 -(Dir - Eugene Levy ) : Corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs . The movie appears to be based on an earlier Italian movie according to the credits but was re - written by two fairly popular American romantic comedy writers . But this one by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts . The story is about a couple of down - and - out traveling Americans , played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young , who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund 's return . Upon trying to return it , they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady 's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money . They freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder . The other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a Monte Carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story . The other cast members include character actors John Candy , James Belushi , Cybill Shepherd , George Hamilton and others . After the police find out about the death , they start questioning the main characters and , of course , they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened . None of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it 's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the Belushi / Shepherd couple . This is n't a horrible movie , it just is n't that good . There are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile . Try it , maybe you 'll like it , probably you wo n't .
0 First , IFC runs Town and Country , and now this . The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther rip - off is that Town and Country was watchable . This isn't.<br /><br />I can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in Europe on somebody else 's dime . Belushi is especially irritating . His scene with Candy ( doing a Z - grade Dom DeLuise ) was torture . Speaking of torture , five minutes of the talentless Shepherd , and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like walnuts!<br /><br />The real " Crime " ( besides this being green - lighted ) is Shepherd 's character : a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for a half - million bucks ! If you buy that , I have some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in !
0 Mix exotic tropical locations , babes in skimpy attire , explosions , good - looking Dudley Do - Right clones , a movie star with his best years behind him ( Martin Sheen ) , a little martial arts and a sexy villainess ( Tracy Lor ..... er , sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords ) and you 'd think you 'd be in for some escapist fun . Not so ! This is a dreary TV movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a " Charlie 's Angels " deal , it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful , irretrievably stupid , recent C.A. movies . This abomination is best described as a THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris film . Nowhere near as much fun as Andy 's " Hard Ticket To Hawaii " , although some of the fight scenes are decent enough . The girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while . There 's better genre stuff that this out there . Oh yeah , and the " babes " are n't as hot as they like to think they are . Terrible soundtrack ... when it 's there .
0 Yes , this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes . Then they introduce Jinx , a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now . Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid 's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space . This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things . Give it a rest , they are there for fun , not to become astronauts just yet , just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp . However , you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role . So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas , but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me . Probably for a few others as well , who else would like to see Kate Capshaw 's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature .
0 Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable , they laughed for several hours . After all , unless you are a politician or work / crew the shuttle , you are not going to get in the shuttle . Furthermore , Space ( Cadet ) Camp is in Alabama , not Florida.<br /><br />The truth is everyone on Earth will win multi - billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible . This film was meant for kids , and had to have been written by one , because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS.<br /><br />This is the most useless film of all time , and it was a well deserved flop .
0 I was in second grade , 12 years ago . I remember it clearly . We were learning about space . All little kids want to go to space , right ? Well , after I saw this , I was so scared to death that I would ' accidentally ' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind . I had no idea that this was a movie . I thought it was some news program or something . I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program ' War of the Worlds . ' So , recently , I get this movie again to watch , realizing my favorite actor , Joaquin Phoenix was in it ( then known as Leaf Phoenix ) . I can tell you , I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting . I mean , when Andy is in space , she moves in slow motion , did you ever notice that ? I do n't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.<br /><br />The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank , and begins to float backwards as the security doors close . Little Max is trying to pull her in . Suddenly , we get a major close up on Max 's face as he shouts ( in slow motion ) " Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg ? ! ? ! ? " I had no idea .
0 OK , forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold . Forget the hideous special effects and poorly - constructed one - dimensional characters . Just looking at the premise of the story . The very reason for the film to exist in the first place , and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together.<br /><br />I know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it . The story is horrible . The acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible . And what s worse , is that the cable Movie channels KEEP SHOWING IT ! Its on twice a day every two or three days ! Why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times , much less to see it at all?<br /><br />My recomendation is do nt even bother spending the energy to watch this thing . Its just not worth it .
0 Space Camp , which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the Challenger accident , deserves such luck . The " stars " make a mockery of acting , Lea Thomson actually being turned sideways , when asked for more than her usual wide - eyed innocent smile , presumably to mask her risible attempts . The movie is at times hilarious , when it begins to ask far too much of you . A small boy keeps a multi - million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm - mates . This hackneyed and unlovable machine , " Jinx " , is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie , which seems part Short Circuit , part 2001 by the Airplane team . I sha n't bore you with this , suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it . Having said all of this , it is enjoyable to watch , in a SeaQuest , Saved by the Bell kind of way . The romance and technology , beware , are as unbelievable as each other . Also , if you 're an eighties freak , its unmissable for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw ( Willie from Temple of Doom ) and , obviously , Lea Thompson . Also , Joaquin Phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe Goonie who befriends Jinx . Do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash .
0 I can not believe how uneducated this movie is . It 's like watching police academy , except it 's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about , and ... Wait , there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick . I can understand suspension of disbelief , but this is just complete stupidity . Not only is there no plot to this movie . It 's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor , throw non - medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility . Plus the people are wearing clothes that are un - befitting for a space program . I feel like I 'm watching a valley - girls " b " movie , in space .
0 I 'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s , it would take two days to outline how the whole thing is n't even remotely possible . Others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already.<br /><br />Given all that , I still could have sort of enjoyed it , if only they had n't included all the maudlin , nauseating , infuriating , Disneyesque sentimental crap , which is so out of place anywhere , but nowhere more than out in space , where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death.<br /><br />The " crew " , as well as the " real " astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else . It completely ruined any value the production may have had left.<br /><br />I'm surprised NASA let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them . If you have n't seen this yet , save yourself the irritation . Watch Apollo 13 again . At least that tried to be sort of real .
0 This film should have been fun . A young Lea Thompson , a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn . In space . But it dragged on , had unlovable characters and had no target audience.<br /><br />Some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs ( named , appropriately , Jinx ) . The space scenes are then long , repetitive ( the same accident happens twice ) and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view . Adults will be bored and cheesed out , kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it.<br /><br />There is a budding romance , but unlike the shuttle -- this never takes off . Why it is included in the first place is unclear , except maybe to add extra tension between the characters - but it failed if that was the idea.<br /><br />A young Lea Thompson should be quirky and attractive , right ? I mean , " Back to the Future " is great . But no , she was irritating and average - looking . Not someone you 'd want to date , have as a friend or even consider as a role model . Joaquin Phoenix ? He 's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance . Maybe he can act like Mikey in the Life Cereal commercials , but he does n't seem to know how to be a normal boy . He does n't fit in on screen and I do n't think we can identify with him at home . I actually would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth.<br /><br />I do n't recommend this film to anyone .
0 Here 's why the Jane Show wo n't work . Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers ca n't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it . I guess these people do n't watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat . No , here we have to do something different , we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it . The characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top : Forklift races ? ? ? give me freaking break . Here 's a little advice for the writers of the show , Do n't write funny situations , find the funny in situations . And remember , you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff , not just be an improv monkey .
0 I rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an Academy Award , but after watching it , it 's easy to see why it did n't . Despite the beautiful photography , the film is incredibly slow moving , despite having hardly any plot.<br /><br />The plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents ' death in what may or may not have been an accident ( the film is never clear on this ) , and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories . The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot , but they 're very short , and do n't really seem to have any point . < br /><br />The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life , but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient , but that does n't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure . Perfect metaphor for this film really . < br /><br />The photography of Skye is beautiful though , but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it 's infinitely better than this one .
0 This film is self indulgent rubbish . Watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack . Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed . It should be charming but is n't - it 's just irritating . The characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor . The stories within the film are also charmless and sinister . I was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter . It is rarely that I can not see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.<br /><br />Although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War . There is n't even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it . A real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to Scotland .
0 Birthday Girl does n't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy , , is it a drama ... it just does n't know . What could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no - man 's land . The premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out . This is a real shame if you look at the cast - it 's very solid all the way through but they do n't get the chance to shine . Very disappointing .
0 It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive ( maffia - like ) character of Russians , or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country ; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England ; and that British police is so inefficient that it can not find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air . In addition , Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere , probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains , but far to be the Russian one . So Nicole , if you really want to talk Russian , kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation .
0 This film 's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD . However , the resulting movie is absolutely dire ! Admittedly , this is not the worst film ever made , or the worst film this year , but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be : comedy , adult drama , thriller , teen - porn ? The story is interesting , as it deals with the pitfalls of mail - order brides , but the film is a mess . What starts out as a mildly interesting " comedy " ( a word I use in the loosest possible terms ) , then goes totally in reverse , and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller . Nicole Kidman should know better , and Ben Chaplin is wasted ! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel , whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect . It 's not funny , it 's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did , and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty . A film to be avoided , unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films !
0 this movie is the worst i ve seen .. nicole kidman really dissapointed me .. this movie has nothing . i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth . great actors but bad script .
0 Nothing in this film interested me . I thought the actors were asleep while they were performing . That 's not laid - back Stanislofsky method , that 's just walking - through and saying lines , I 'm afraid . Kidman 's performance is sad . The story is , however , mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting .
0 This film features Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a mail order bride from Russia , recieves Nicole Kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when , surprise , she is n't what she appears to be . The story is fairly predictible and Chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying . Kidman is actualy rather good in this role , making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting . GRADE : C
0 If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood , let it be boy . But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio.<br /><br />After having watched such a good movie as Arisan ( 2003 ) , it is terrible to see what they come up with again in Indonesia . It seems that the only idea is to make money , but no one seems seriously to work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment . That it is a ' global ' world does n't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia . And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as ' Made in Indonesia ' with a flavor of the west , they get away with it.<br /><br />OK , the story is nice to begin with . And it could have developed into a nice flick . But did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music OR at least good playback , and secondly good choreography ? In this movie , the playback is SO BAD that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema . Every single word you hear is followed seconds LATER by the actor or whoever sing playback , and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie.<br /><br />The choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics , but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They only forgot to change the choreography . It is hardly dancing you see , they jump here and there , throw their legs up in the air , and that is about it.<br /><br />Well , at least there 's a happy ending .... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic , DO SO !
0 What 's with Indonesian musical movies ? Never have I seen Indonesian musical movies like the ones made in Bollywood . They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of ' what they called ' poetic lines.<br /><br />This story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks . It 's a simple story plot ( but it 's quite focused though ) with ' meant to be ' musical story lines here and there.<br /><br />Confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected . The main actress may try to live up the character , but it 's the best that she could do , trying . As for the casting , I do n't feel the necessity to put a Balinese student in that story and of course , that 's not the only unnecessary characters.<br /><br />The strange thing is , why would I want to watch this movie ? Maybe because of the mangoes ...
0 I wonder who , how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit Broadway in many many years ? He 's an Academy Award winning director . Yes , he won for Ghandi you moron ! Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa ? He has experience with musicals . Really ? " Oh what a lovely war " have you forgotten ? To answer your question , yes ! The film is a disappointment , clear and simple . Not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings . Every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical . I felt nothing . But when I saw it on stage I felt everything . The film should have been cast with stars , unknown , newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group . Great actors who could dance beautifully . Well Michael Douglas was in it . True I forgot I 'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right . Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical .
0 For those who never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film , this film is OK as movie musicals , nothing special , just OK . I have seen the show on Broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production , the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that I do n't even know where to begin . First of all , for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production , let me assure you that IRL when you audition for a play , the director , producer , and choreographer never ask personal questions and do n't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer . A real theatrical audition , whether it be for a play or a musical , rarely takes more than five minutes . If you 're auditioning as a dancer , you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once , you do it , and then they decide immediately whether you 're in or out . Michael Bennett 's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little . The play is about these dancers . First of all , director Richard Attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the Cassie / Zach relationship and by casting Michael Douglas as Zach . In the play , you NEVER see Zach ... he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with Cassie is barely touched upon . Cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to Larry ( a character who is not even in the play)was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about . Major musical numbers were cut or rethought . The opening number in the play " I Hope I Get It " shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated . In the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who ca n't dance ( can you say " Audrey Landers " ) . " Goodbye 12 , Goodbye 13 , Hello Love " , a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers ' childhood 's jaundiced memories was reworked as " Surprise , Surprise " mainly a vehicle for the late Gregg Burge as Richie . The show 's most famous song , " What I Did for Love " which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance , becomes just another standard love song in the film , performed tiredly by a miscast Allyson Reed as Cassie . Jeffrey Hornaday 's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and does n't hold a candle to Michael Bennett ' original staging and when you 're making a movie about dancers , the choreography has to be special . There are a couple of good dancers in the film , the previously mentioned Gregg Burge as Richie , Michelle Johnston as Bebe , and Janet Jones as Judy , but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do , yet Audrey Landers , who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time , is given one of the show 's best numbers , " Dance 10 , Looks 3 . " I will admit that the finale , " One " is dazzling , but you have to wait almost two hours for that . I would say that if you never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage , this film might be worth a look , but if you are a devotee of the original Broadway musical ... be afraid ... be very afraid .
0 I saw the original " Chorus Line " on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion , despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater . Michael Bennett knew he would have to re - imagine " Chorus " for the screen but could never figure out how to do it . If the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question . There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience . However , Richard Attenborough fresh of the musical work of " Ghandi " and dancing with animals in " Doctor Doolittle " ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show . Horrible songs were added ( Surprise ! Surprise ! ) , great songs were dropped or given to other characters ( which did n't make sense ) . Michael Douglas was mis - cast . People that could n't dance tried to act and there was the sexy " Landers " woman who could n't sing , act , or dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi 's wife . The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from " Flashdance " rejects and nothing works . I sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing . If you truly love this show and it is coming back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but do n't think that the long running musical event that was " A Chorus Line " has any thing at all to do with this film .
0 I admit to having been a fan of the original stage production . I never saw the movie version until very lately on cable , and watched it with anticipation , to see my memories brought alive again , because I adored the original show . Imagine my dismay.<br /><br />This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show to film ever made . They changed the story , they changed the songs , they lost the soul . I was expecting a trip down memory lane , singing to the extraordinarily touching Music and the Mirror , At the Ballet , and Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen . Not ! Not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point , but they messed up the storyline , adding songs and exterior plotlines ( hello Cassie and Michael Douglas ) not present in the original , and injecting " drama " where it was n't necessary . The original had enough pathos on its own . If you were a fan of the original Broadway show , do n't bother . I 'm sorry I wasted my time , and diluted my memories , watching this tripe .
0 On Broadway , A Chorus Line was pure magic . From the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale , a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show , we were totally engaged - captivated by the intensely personal stories , some funny , some clever , some stirring , of this chorus line . The movie is another matter entirely . The focus is now on the director - and WHAT an ogre he is ! Every time the film switches to Michael Douglas , there he is with a bitter , sour expression , barking out questions and orders , screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance . Yikes ! ! That changes the dynamics of the story . On Broadway , the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence , but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong / fragile / intriguing / hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity . There is a reason this work won the Pulitzer Prize ! And actually in one of the only moments the director appears , he is there to comfort the young Puerto Rican Dancer after we hear that dancer 's heart - breaking story . He appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection/ concern for Cassie . But in the movie , from the second Douglas ' director starts bitterly barking orders , the chorus line members ' stories become secondary . It 's like they are in a lousy profession , where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show , is jaded , exhausted , furious at having to audition these chorus members . On stage , there was ALWAYS the excitement of the show . Here in the movie practically from the word go , you feel sorry for everyone involved . During the course of the musical , we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well , and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job ! But of course that could n't happen . But in the Finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage , sometimes reflecting us in the audience , in our hearts , and we know , also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected , they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much , bringing magic to the theatre . In the movie , after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis , that magic becomes totally diluted . All we feel ( even with the exact same curtain call ) , is that some of the members got a job with a mean - spirited director . So they all come on the screen and are dancing again . Big deal .
0 Yes , I was lucky enough to see the long - running original production of Michael Bennett 's hit musical . It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985 . It is awful . Almost everything fails . First off , Attenborough ( a fine actor , a good director with the right material ) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to mangle ANNIE . The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the CASTING ! ! ! They are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry , talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you could n't take your eyes off of them . But this cast just gets by dancing , does a " nice " job singing but none of them spark one bit . In fact , look up the cast on IMDb - none of them really went on to do anything much . ( OK , OK , Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh ) . So this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic , the desperation , the passion of the stage musical . A total strike - out ! ( But even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was ) .
0 I 'm not a stage purist . A movie could have been made of this play , and it would almost necessarily require changes ... comme ci , comme ca . But the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie 's creators who are in full - on " shallow blockbuster " mode . It would be hard to imagine a worse director . Perhaps only Josh Logan & Jack Warner could have ruined this in the same way Attenborough did.<br /><br />Onstage A Chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method . Dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage - career experiences ( very 70s ! ) . Then Bennett and Hamlisch took some time , handed them a song and cast them as themselves . ... astonishing ! Unbelievably modern . The ' story'of ACL is ( in turn ) about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of , because the play does n't matter . It was meta before the idea was invented , 25 years before Adaptation noodled with a similar idea . ACL was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive , & which is a hallmark of modern creativity : that technique itself is compelling ... that there 's more drama in an average person 's life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters . What a gracious idea . The stage play had one performance area ( an empty stage ) and three different ways to alter the backdrop , to alleviate visual tedium , not to keep viewers distracted . The space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted . It worked just fine . That was the point . All these ideas are trampled or bastardized . Set - wise , there was n't one , and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows , in which the exhilarating " One " is finally , powerfully , performed in full ( gold ) top hats and tails , with moves we recognize because we 've watched them in practice sessions . The pent - up anxiety of the play is released --- and audiences went nuts . < br /><br />After Grampa manhandles this , it 's like a mushed , strangled bird . He clearly has the earlier , respected All that Jazz ( and Fosse 's stage piece Dancin ' ) in mind as he makes his choices . Hamlisch 's score was edgy & interesting for it 's time , but time has not been kind to it . It 's as schmaltzy as " jazz hands . " And that 's before Attenborough ever touches it . He 's remarkable at finding whatever good was left , and mangling it . < br /><br />A simple question might have helped Attenborough while filming this , " Could I bear spending even a few minutes with people like these ? " A major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater ( pivotal by it 's absence in theater ) would be addressed in the film format . There 's never been a more " frontal " play . The answer they came up with was , " I 'm sorry .. what was the question ? " The cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives , to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience , and blending their grating selves together . I was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope , clowning at the ( absent ) audience . The play made you understand theater people . This movie just makes you want to choke them.<br /><br />Perhaps Broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience ( Les Miz , Miss Saigon ) instead of relating to other characters started here . But the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie . < br /><br />A Chorus Line is pure schlock .
0 If you were to judge based on the movie alone , the committee that gave the stage musical " A Chorus Line " a Pulitzer Prize , and Broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years , were all on heavy narcotics , because one singular sensation this film certainly is NOT.<br /><br />What possessed anyone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me , but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay.<br /><br />Not content with the original score the way it was originally written , someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip . Thus we are assaulted with the Oscar - nominated ( ! ) " Surprise , Surprise . " Well surprise , surprise , the song stinks , and so does the movie.<br /><br />Grade : D
0 I first saw the live musical at the Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was absolutely mind - blowing , Stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked it much more than most musicals that I have seen on the stage . The interesting thing is that you NEVER got to see Zach 's face . He was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production . Whe I heard they were making a movie from it , I waited with bated breath , but when I watched the movie version I was so bummed - out disappointed that I felt I was cheated . The movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character . Personally , I would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived , I would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it . It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy .
0 This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made . The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful . This movie misses the mark in almost every way . Even the casting is baffling . Take Audrey Landers as Val . " Dance 10 Looks 3 " is Val 's song . Val 's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department . Yes , she finds a solution , but ultimately she 's a great dancer . What do the brilliant filmmakers do ? They hire an actress who ca n't dance and is famous for looking great . Way to miss the boat.<br /><br />Then there 's the choreography . I 'm sure Michael Bennett was turning over in his grave . Why did n't they use his choreography ? It really ca n't be improved upon .
0 This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever . Even the music has been destroyed . Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false . I will say , though , that it is almost bad enough to be funny.<br /><br />The hairstyles are remarkably dated . I can not for the life of me understand what is meant ( conceptually ) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where " A Chorus Line " is playing . Are we to think that these people are auditioning for " A Chorus Line , " which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning ? Oh no , the show is collapsing on itself.<br /><br />I saw the original production , and have listened to the album hundreds of times . Why , oh , why , did they do this ?
0 Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante 's Broadway show ran for years , but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation , which most likely stems from the choice of director ( Richard Attenborough , as far from B - way as you could get ) and lead actor ( Michael Douglas , who plays a director - choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer ) . The slim story , about a grueling audition for a Broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor - dancer - singers , is pushed right up on us , with loud , brassy talents playing to the rafters . Nothing is modulated or subtle , particularly a laughable subplot about a ex - dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old - flame Douglas . The over - eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache , but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing ; this , matched with Attenborough 's sluggish pacing , spells disaster , and even the now - famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I recently bought the DVD , forgetting just how much I hated the movie version of " A Chorus Line . " Every change the director Attenborough made to the story failed.<br /><br />By making the Director - Cassie relationship so prominent , the entire ensemble - premise of the musical sails out the window.<br /><br />Some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed . The show 's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to Cassie 's character.<br /><br />The overall staging is very self - conscious.<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 2 , is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film 's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it .
0 By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times , and had been anticipating most eagerly the long - rumored production of a film of the story . My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released . It was not just a disappointment , it was a kick in the abdomen . < br /><br />First , the story was " moved outside , " so to speak , by including scenes not in the confines of the theater . Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story . < br /><br />Second & Third together ( assign your own order ) : one of the original songs , with very dynamic dance number , was removed ; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added . Say what ? ? I 'm confused ! < br /><br />The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers . I 've now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times , and would n't mind seeing it 6 more times before I die . It is superbly written , with wonderful music , and heart- wrenchingly true stories . If you want to see a musical which includes a great " cattle call " audition , I recommend All That Jazz . If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line , see it on stage .
0 The Broadway musical , " A Chorus Line " is arguably the best musical in theatre . It 's about the experiences of people who live for dance ; the joys they experience , and the sacrifices they make . Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line , yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite . < br /><br />The film version , though , captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show , and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical , as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance , whatsoever . < br /><br />The biggest mistake was made in giving the director 's job to Sir Richard Attenborough , whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for " Gandhi . " Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?<br /><br />Which brings us to the next problem . " A Chorus Line " takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes . It 's the least flashy of Broadway musicals , and its simplicity was its glory . However , that does n't translate well to film , and no one really thought that it would . For that reason , the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers , and should have left the theatre and audition process . The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet , jazz or tap class . Heck , they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations . Yet , not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film , as Attenborough 's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.<br /><br />Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director ( Michael Douglas ) whether he wants to hear them or not . Douglas ' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear , and to whom he has no patience . < br /><br />While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play , some heretical changes were made . The very beautiful " Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen , Hello Love "-- a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence -- was removed and replaced with the dreadful , " Surprise , " a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar . Adding insult to injury , " Surprise " simply retold the same story as " Hello , Love " but without the wit or pathos.<br /><br />There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film . If you want to see a film version of this show , the next closest thing is Bob Fosse 's brilliant " All That Jazz . " While Fosse 's daughter is in " A Chorus Line , " HE is the Fosse who should have been involved , as director . He would have known what to do with this material , which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort .
0 For anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical A CHORUS LINE , the movie is a shoddy substitute . Not only are songs cut , but unnecessary plot twists added , new dance sequences choreographed , and , let 's face it , Richard Attenborough just does n't know how to film dancers.<br /><br />Onstage , Michael Bennett 's A CHORUS LINE was just that : Michael Bennett . His idea , his choreography , his direction , his gift to Broadway and the rest of the world . It was two hours of hard - hitting , in - your - face realism that really made you feel for these " boys " and " girls . " The movie , however , lacks empathy and depth : the actors look like they are auditioning for A CHORUS LINE rather than actually auditioning . Every move , every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned ; Michael Douglas , especially , as Zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer . Even when he throws his temper tantrums , you never quite believe him because every gesture , every accented word , every nuance is so obviously rehearsed . And as for him not dancing : Kevin Kline auditioned for the role of Zach on Broadway . Michael Bennett loved his reading , but Kline could n't dance and ultimately lost the part . How I wish they had done the same for Douglas ! A CHORUS LINE is supposed to be a show about nobodies , and aside from a few recognizable faces ( Vicki Frederick , who played Cassie on Broadway , as Sheila and Khandi Alexander , of TV 's NewsRadio , as one of the many auditioning dancers ) you 're not supposed to KNOW any of these people . Because you DO know these people . Having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision : when you focus on Michael Douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories , you lose something.<br /><br />It is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show ( Montage : Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen , Hello Love ) is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled " Surprise , Surprise " that surprisingly received a nomination at the Oscars . Cassie 's " mirror dance " has a new song and tragically boring choreography -- one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.<br /><br />For fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version , this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved . For those who never got to see the original production , either on Broadway or on tour , this movie is the only reference they will have to go by . And they 'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest - running musical in Broadway history -- until a little show called CATS overtook it in the late 1990 's . But THAT is a different story , and do n't even get me started there .
0 Hi , Everyone , If you saw " Singing in the Rain , " you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain . You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor , " Make 'em Laugh . " If you saw " Royal Wedding , " you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling . If you saw " Jailhouse Rock , " you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by The King himself.<br /><br />That is what is missing here . There could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation . The closest was Chuck McGowan 's " I Can Do That . " the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film . Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure . He pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing.<br /><br />Yelling at people auditioning for a part in a Broadway production is not entertainment . Michael Douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a Western or a comedy . He is OK when he is in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at . It does not work here.<br /><br />The cast was good except for Michael , of course . A good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production , but someone should have thought about how to film it.<br /><br />Next time they do one of these I hope they call me first.<br /><br />Tom Willett
0 This film is regarded by some as a classic - I 've no idea why . It is terrible to the point of being laughable . The only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.<br /><br />There are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film , but SO WHAT ! There is no plot , it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery , and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever . My brother once forced me to watch this film , because he said I would n't believe how bad a film can get ! He was right.<br /><br />Normally with a film this dreadful I would recommend that people should n't watch it , but in this case I think people should , as it will put every other bad film you 've seen in perspective .
0 i was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city .. i was younger then .. but it was an Excellent play .. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it .. and why Michael Douglas ? ? ? He did nt suit the role .. this movie really sucked BIG time ! ! ! < br /><br />my advise is NOT to rent this movie .. save your money for something better like " Cats " ....
0 A pale shadow of a great musical , this movie suffers from the fact that the director , Richard Attenborough , completely misses the point of the musical , needlessly " opens " it up , and muddies the thrust of the play . The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not - always - rewarding line of work . Attenborough gives us a fresh - faced cast of hopefuls , assuming that they are trying to get their " big break " in show business , rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working " gypsies " living show to show , along with a couple of newcomers . The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene , showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line ( depending on how you count Cassie , who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie ) . Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly - conceived film .
0 Awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming , crisp location photography , but it 's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension . I was kinda hoping that Stanwyck would n't make it back in time because , really , she was saddled with the wet , in more ways than one , husband , and she had an idiot child as well .. why NOT run off with Meeker ? But the nagging question remains .. what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off did n't float ? Stanwyck , always impeccably professional , does the best she could with the material but it 's threadbare .
0 Just a dumb old movie . First Stanwyck 's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way , and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way . In an effort to save him , Stanwyck gets unlucky , yet again , and comes across an escaped convict . She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way . In the end her husband is saved , and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is . All 's well than ends dumb.<br /><br />I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood 's glamour - oriented Golden Era ; that nose is so beautiful   So photogenic   The film is mercifully short , running a little over an hour . It 's as though the director sensed that he was making crap , so he thought it best to keep the crap short .
0 Well , my goodness , am I disappointed . When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise 's 1963 film , " The Haunting " , I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer - movie sized visual effects . But , deep down , I had faith . Surely , with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and company will not ruin a film , who 's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety . Well , subtlety , where are you now ! ! ? ? My fears have manifested ... a promising movie has gone wrong . Yes , Eugenio Zannetti 's production design is jaw - dropping ; the movie is wonderfully photographed ; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong . But , the script puts it 's fine actors to the test .. asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies . In the end , the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity ... and that 's just barely . But , the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us . We can no longer use our imaginations , feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown . No , we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we 're supposed to be afraid of ... and you know what ? As wonderfully realized as they are ... the visual effects come off as sort of silly . And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess ... but things had gone terribly wrong long before that . < br /><br />Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown . I 'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity ... only groans . Check out the original instead.<br /><br / >
0 For movie fans who have never heard of the book ( Shirley Jackson 's " The Haunting of Hill House " ) and have never seen the 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris , this remake will seem pretty darn bad.<br /><br />For those of us who have , it is just plain awful.<br /><br />Bad acting ( what was Neeson thinking ? ) , goofy computer enhancements , and a further move away from Jackson 's story doom this remake.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie . It still effectively scares without hokey special effects . The acting is professional and believable.<br /><br />For readers of the book , the from 1963 follows the it much closer .
0 The Haunting , if you have seen the original , you know a great ghost story , it 's perfection on film . It 's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements , it terrified people . It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film . So when The Haunting was remade in 1999 , a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction " WHAT ? WHY ? WHAT THE  " But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation , I 'm pretty cool with it . This is definitely not the case , this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares   pfft ! PG-13 , what where they thinking ? Not much apparently.<br /><br />When her mother dies and her sister evicts her , Nell receives a phone call , telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House , a secluded manor . Upon arrival , Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley , a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark . Shortly thereafter , two other participants in the study arrive , wild Theo and " bad sleeper " Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow . Unknown to the participants , Doctor Marrow 's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear . Each night , the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House , preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning , when the caretakers open the lock . There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away . Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House . The house was built by Hugh Crain , Crain built the house for his wife , hoping to fill it with a large family full of children , however all of Crain 's children died during birth . Crain 's wife killed herself before the house was finished , and Crain became a recluse . The first night , Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house , including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes . Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words " Welcome Home , Eleanor " , and becomes extremely distraught , setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain 's cruelty . She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him . He then burned the bodies in the house 's fireplace to hide any evidence . She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn , of whom Nell is descended . Everyone thinks she 's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.<br /><br />Seriously , I suggest you stay away from this film , it 's really stupid and pointless . Not to mention the actress the played Nell , Lili Taylor completely annoyed me , her performance , her look , just everything about her , do n't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again . Catherine Zeta Jones just did n't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson , a wonderful actor wasted talent once again . The effects are way over the top and too computerized , I just ca n't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud . Believe me , if you are going to be afraid of something , be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid  . Oh , this film is already hurting me , just do n't see it , it 's bad.<br /><br />1/10
0 Considering the original film version of ' The Haunting " is in my top ten films of all time ' I approached this adaption with trepidation . I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh , all those involved should be ashamed . the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason ! you see nothing . Robert Wise used innovative camera - work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work 's . The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B , sadder still is that the ingredients were there ( actors such as Liam Neeson , Catherine Zeta Jones ) to do something different . This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery !
0 This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well , then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects . For example , in the original , one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds , listening in terror to the noises outside their room . Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her . Nell then looks across at Theo , who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand . In the latest version , Nell is lying alone in bed , when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor . It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened . And can anybody explain what Nell 's final words mean - " It 's about family . It 's always been about family"?<br /><br />The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor 's performance , but even this can not save the film . Catherine Zeta - Jones demonstrates once again that , beneath her pretty exterior , there is little depth . In the original , Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion . Zeta - Jones , however has to spell it out , for example , by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend.<br /><br />Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard .
0 So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country . You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and ( not surprisingly ) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason . Anywhoo , the people laugh , joke etc . This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids . They get scared , they start to feel stuff . Oh no , a girl see 's s ghost . Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc . This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls , yeah yeah , blah blah . She does but , oh no , she dies as she does . And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell . Two people survive and escape the house . The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor ( the one who dies saving the kids ) says " oh no " . The acting is wooden , the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again . Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it , but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss . I was extremely disappointed when I watched this . A very big let down . My sister ( who gets sacred very easily ) got bored in this film it is appalling .
0 The original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any " monster " , it just SUGGESTED scary " things " , .<br /><br />This version however shows every aspect of a " sick minded ghost " , including unnecessary special effects . < br /><br />The " mystery " , as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened . By showing the face of the " old man " , this Mister has completely disappeared . Even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces ) is ridiculous . This is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
0 The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography . Yes remakes are n't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are . I suppose that the A - List actors ( Liam Neeson , Catherine Zeta Jones , Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot , ridiculous special effects , and terrible attempts at scaring it 's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we do n't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed . The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever 's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained . The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you do n't really care about any of the characters at all . Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she 's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is . Lily Taylor is n't made for the horror genre at all . The ghosts are stupid and cheesy , they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost 's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine . There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it 's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad . The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that does n't save it from it 's brutal everything else . I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would 've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel . Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects , a poor attempt at horror .
0 This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made , , , , it had everything to make a movie great . Incredible acting , awesome special effects ...... oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie . Well this was n't one of them , it just plain sucked . < br /><br />What I want to know is , what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10 . When I casted my vote there were 206 out there , god knows what goes on in their head . Now as for any other vote , a 8 or 9 was even too high , but a 10 ? ? ? Come on , what made this movie sooooo good to give it a 10 ? I know these are the same 206 that thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor .
0 Somewhere in his non - fiction book DANSE MACABRE , Stephen King suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them . If at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through , the reader may be a little scared , but he 'll also think , " Well , I can deal with that . At least it was n't a HUNDRED feet tall . " There 's nothing more frightening than what lurks , unseen and unknown , just on the other side of that tightly closed door , waiting to get you.<br /><br />THE HAUNTING is so completely misconceived that director Jan De Bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling : " Look , everybody , look ! It 's a ten - foot - tall bug ! Is n't that SCARY ? ! " The law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in . By the end of the movie , the director is , so to speak , jumping up and down , banging his CGI pots and pans madly , and hoarsely screaming : " Look , everyone , look ! Here come ten HUNDRED - foot - tall bugs ! ... And now , here come a hundred THOUSAND - foot - tall bugs ! " < br /><br />The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor ( and there are many ) . They ca n't and do n't . In fact , impressive as they are , the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them -- whether in admiration or annoyance -- instead of being immersed in a story.<br /><br />For me , the nadir of this film 's sheer stupidity comes when a statue , with " blood " gushing from its mouth , tries to drown Liam Neeson ( as Dr. Marrow ) in a fountain . The filmmakers clearly did n't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it , so they just have Neeson thrash around in the water a bit , flailing his arms and going glug - glug . By the next scene , the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and , ho hum , forgotten all about the annoying incident.<br /><br />Shirley Jackson 's novel seems to have been dumbed - down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low - IQ teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder : " Okay , next , let 's , uh , make the ceiling , you know , look like a creepy face , and , uh , come down on her ... and all these spiky things , like , trap her in the bed." < br /><br />The sole saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it at last becomes so awful that it 's actually funny . By the time Owen Wilson ( as Luke Sanderson ) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic - Carpet Ride O ' Death , I just about fell on the floor myself , laughing.<br /><br />Badly constructed , witless , grotesquely heavy - handed , utterly unbelievable , and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes , this vacuous HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie .
0 They screwed up this story ! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that ! They added heads getting chopped , wires cutting peoples faces , and the ceiling turning into a giant hand ! What the hell is that about ? ? ? I own and love the original movie , I read the book and I love it ! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost . There is no gore . There is no ceiling hand . It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person . They can not kill us , they can not throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head . No . They can only drive us mad . Taking away all our senses of security . Nell was a selfish woman . She only wanted good things for herself . Yes , she cared a little for the others , but not too much . David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story ! I hate this damn remake !
0 The Haunting . A remake , of course . The original was a creepy psychological thriller , and one that has improved with time . Compared to this 1999 remake , it 's a classic . There is no character development here , only caricatures ( the slut , the authoritative brain , the " I 'm gon na get us outta here " fellow , the oh so sensitive bookworm ) . But , seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the " star " , I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern . Unfortunately , the effects are laughable . Mewing cherubs , stretchy doors , irritating dead children that ca n't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it 's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows . Ill take my Skittles orally , thank you . Bruce Dern , I 've liked you since " The Cowboys " . Stop it .
0 How viewers react to this new " adaption " of Shirley Jackson 's book , which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie ( true enough ) , will be based , I suspect , on the following : those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one ... and those who have never been exposed to either , and who are big fans of Hollywood 's current trend towards " special effects " being the first and last word in how " good " a film is , are going to love it.<br /><br />Things I did not like about this adaption:<br /><br />1 . It was NOT a true adaption of the book . From the articles I had read , this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to . And , that seemed reasonable , no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND ! ( And not even then ) But , there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at , in the movie . Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING . I did n't like that , either . What the movie 's press release SHOULD have said is ... "We got the basic , very basic , idea from Shirley Jackson 's book , we kept the same names of the house and several ( though not all ) of the leading character 's names , but then we decided to write our own story , and , what the heck , we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first , and decided to throw in a bit of them , too." < br /><br />2 . They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts , to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been " born bad " . No , instead , this " doctor " got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their " insomnia " ( he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like lab rats , who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment ... nice guy ) . This doctor , who did not have the same name , by the way , was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.<br /><br />3 . In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies " some houses are just born bad " , this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there ... and , this time around , Nel gets to unravel the mystery ( shades of THE CHANGELING ) . The only problem was , the so - called mystery was so incoherently told that I 'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience ... but , then there was no mystery in the first place ( not in the book ) , because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH . It 's first " victim " died before ever setting eyes on it.<br /><br />4 . The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous . He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house ( and was a true skeptic of it 's " history") ... and in this one he was just a winey - voiced , bumbling nerd who could n't sleep(insomnia remember ) and was a compulsive liar.<br /><br />5 . I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word ( the scene with Nel 's sister 's family , and Mrs. Dudley 's little opening speech ... ) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING . It 's like it could n't make up its mind what it wanted to do.<br /><br />6 . I missed Nel 's narrative through the whole movie . The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person , through Nel 's eyes , and we always were privy to her thoughts . That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version . They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine . The original Nel was not a bad person , but she was a bitter person ( could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister ? ) and she liked to moan , and she lost her temper ... This one was almost too good to be true . This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer 's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times.<br /><br />7 . They changed the history of the house and it 's occupents too much . There was no Abigail Crain ( the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions ) , there was no " companion " , and there was no nursery . There was also no " Grace " ( wife of the original doctor ) and Hugh Crain 's wives died in totally different ways . These changes , changed the story WAY too much . I do n't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should ... BE SORRY ( if ya get my drift ! ! ! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!).<br /><br />In conclusion , let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke ( appropriate substitution of the word " house " for " movie " ! ) : " This ' movie ' should be burnt to the ground , and the ground sprinkled with salt ! " My favorite movie of all time remains so . No competition from this one .
0 The Shirley Jackson novel ' The Haunting of Hill House ' is an atmospheric tale of terror , which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion . The atmosphere is well set out , and the chills are staged well . A haunting masterpiece.<br /><br />The 1963 chiller ' The Haunting ' stays closely to the book , but also adds its own details to the plot . Fortunately , these are very few , and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen . The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie . Excellent ! < br /><br />And then , Jan de Bont made this . In 1999 , the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake . Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself , but for the moment , lets look at the film itself.<br /><br />It starts off averagely , as most horror movies do . The set used for Hill House is beautiful , and oddly mysterious , and for a few minutes , it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re - telling . And then , the first scare comes : a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman 's face ( Dr. Marrow 's assistant ) . This is hilarious , and truth be told , it nearly had me in tears.<br /><br />From then on , the film just spirals downwards . The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on , with Owen Wilson 's character being particularly irritating ( so it 's such a relief when he 's decapitated by the flue).<br /><br />The special effects practically make this movie , , which is a shame , because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated . Examples of these are many , so I wo n't bother listing them.<br /><br />So , all in all , I , along with hundreds of others , strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller , or , as an alternative , buy the novel by Shirley Jackson . But please , stay away from this . And , if you do decide to watch this , watch it on the TV ( as a lot of the channels love to screen this film , and not the original ) or rent it cheap , but please do n't buy it , whatever you do . Do n't waste your money!<br /><br />Final rating : 4/10
0 There were only two things that kept me interested in this film : I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die , and Catherine Zeta Jones.<br /><br />This was basically a one woman show . Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye - candy . Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film . Like Jones , he had no role at all . The film was all Lily Taylor ( Ransom , Ready to Wear ) . She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self . OK , it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.<br /><br />I do n't know what director Jan de Bont 's problem was . he did a great job with Speed and Twister . he really fell down on the job here . Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2 : Cruise Control . He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West , else this would be the worst picture of 1999.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs .
0 It 's my opinion that when you decide to re - make a very good film , you should strive to do better than the original ; or at least give it a fresh point of view . Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson 's remarkable novel " The Haunting of Hill House " is worth the price of admission even today . Now fast forward to 1999 and the re - make . I was left shaking my head and asking , why ? The acting is wooden , the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate . I had heard that this update was bad ; but could n't believe it was that bad , considering the source material . I was wrong . After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was , she said ; " Well they got your money ! " She 's right , do n't let them get yours . If there 's no profit in making lousy re - makes , maybe they 'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that does n't insult their audience
0 Pretty bad movie offers nothing new . The usual creaks and moans attempt to make - up for a muddled , but thin story . Acting is barely above pathetic . Why Liam Neeson signed on for this is anyone 's guess . Owen Wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror - movie history . Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much else although Lili Tayor did an above - average job . The special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous . However they ca n't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute . Do n't bother .
0 I do n't even know where to begin on this one . " It 's all about the family . " That has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a " horror " movie , although this could n't be a horror movie even if it tried ! ! ! Ugh ! ! ! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor . He needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie ( Anaconda , Armageddon ) . After all , the man did co - write " Bottle Rocket " and " Rushmore . " He does have some talent . Also , Lily Taylor should stick to indie films . She has no place here . Finally , Catherine Zeta - Jones should become a porn star . There 's no room in legitimate acting for her . I 'm serious . One of the worst movies I 've ever seen , EVER .
0 Effect(s ) without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood remakes , not only is it possible , it 's required . The Haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st - class cinematographer - turner - director who once showed promise ( Jan de Bont- Speed ) but has since produced a string of big budget garbage ( Twister , Speed 2).<br /><br />Actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it . Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta - Jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film . Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing . Events just happen , good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non - event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity.<br /><br />There really is n't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now . Why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake ?
0 The script for this movie was probably found in a hair - ball recently coughed up by a really old dog . Mostly an amateur film with lame FX . For you Zeta - Jones fanatics : she has the credibility of one Mr. Binks .
0 I have yet to read Shirley Jackson 's novel , something of which I 've been meaning to do for quite sometime . I am sure it has got to be scarier than this film . I remember jumping once when I watched it the other day , although I can not recall the scene . < br /><br />The special effects are great and I watched this on DVD , but I am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight . After the first few special effects are done with I was waiting for a story to develop.<br /><br />I figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel , so a good story should be there , but it was n't . I was relegated to staring at the gorgeous Catherine Zeta - Jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch . Lili Talor was such a suck character . I did not like her one bit , something about whiny people . Also , the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish Dudley DoRight with his voice and face . I could not relate to the characters at all . Quigon , ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.<br /><br />Half to three quarters of the way I was just dying to go see a campy Friday the 13th or a Scream Queenish film ! At least there is some type of entertainment value . If there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females . This had nothing . < br /><br / >
0 The 1963 version of " The Haunting " has been one of my favorite horror films for years , so I anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation . It hardly seemed that any follow - up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece . Unfortunately my worries were well - founded : This movie stinks.<br /><br />I do n't know what the people involved in this film were thinking . Jan De Bont , who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent " Speed , " does as poorly here ( or perhaps even worse ) as he did with the much - hyped duds " Twister " and " Speed 2 : Cruise Control . " Hey Jan , stick to cinematography , would ya ? Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor - pretending - to - be - a - sleep - psychologist -- I do n't think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance -- but even he can not save a lame script and weak story . Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again ( as she did in " Entrapment " ) that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her . The female lead , who did great in an episode of " The X - Files , " looks lost here as Eleanor , an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity . And that blond guy , whoever he is , is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house . I do n't think he changes expression once during the entire film.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />The reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of Eleanor 's precarious mental state . No spirits are actually seen in the original , leaving much up to the imagination -- a hallmark of other great horror films like " The Changeling " and " The Blair Witch Project . " In this updated version , we of course get tons of CGI ghosts , which basically ( in the face of the weak script / plot ) make the movie totally unscary . The f / x are n't even that great , considering they were done by ILM . The frozen breath looks particularly fake . The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson film " The Frighteners , " which I saw just before this one , were a lot better . The wooden carvings of the children , which are supposed to look creepy , just look silly ( especially when they scream ) , and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about . Rather than providing a relief from the bad acting , bad direction , and bad writing , the effects only add to this mess of a film.<br /><br />Some particularly dumb scenes : When the three other characters break into Eleanor 's bedroom , and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed . The scene where Eleanor " sees " the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters ... the acting here is particularly bad . And last , but not least , the unintentionally hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish , leaps up on a piece of furniture , and starts slashing away at the painting of the old , evil guy who built the house . We actually get some satisfaction in this scene , as seconds after his attack , Blond Guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue . It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed.<br /><br />In sum , stick to the original 1963 " The Haunting . " 3/10 stars .
0 I am not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren . I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent . That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent . Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is , but many neglect to point out the positives . < br /><br />Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed ca n't be all bad . Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens ? Are n't there any other kind of teens ? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy ? One genius nerd that nobody likes ? One slutty girl who is very friendly and ( in this movie ) pregnant ? One disturbed anti - social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented ( but what is the talent ? ) . And one laid - back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him . Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color . They do n't say much but get shot at some point . < br /><br />Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school . Preferably with the writers inside . The dialogue is bad , and the plot is worse . When the bad guys ( and girl ) finally hijack a van full of drugs , then they sit inside the van making out . They drive the van to the school because they want to re - paint the van at the school 's paint shop , but they never get around to re - painting the van . By the way , it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van . They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score . < br /><br />For some reason , they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher ( Dolph Lundgren ) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours . The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles , so why go after them ? < br /><br />Anyhow , the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns , and they keep finding the teens ( including a guy in a wheel chair ) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss . Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed . For every time someone gets shot , there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss . The stunts are pretty bad . < br /><br />I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $ 10 Million , and I am amazed . When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher . Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam . It was a test to watch it , but I passed .
0 Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren . Lungren is a one time military man who has retreated into a teaching job . But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he?s going to hang it up . Things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery . Its Dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death . Jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair . What a stupid movie . Watchable in a I can?t believe people made this sort of way , this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget , fake breakaway sets and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye . Watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school ( don?t ask ) they crash into the security turret ( don?t ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school ) and smash its barely constructed form apart(it does n't look like it did in earlier shots ) . What hath the gods of bad movies wrought ? Actually I?m perplexed since this was directed ( ? ) by Sydney J Furie , a really good director who made films like The Boys in Company C. Has his ability failed him , or was this hopeless from the get go and he did n't even bother ? It?s a turkey . A watchable one but a turkey none the less .
0 Normally I would n't feel qualified to review something I only saw a half hour of , but I 'll make an exception for this one.<br /><br />Let the dialogue speak for itself ! Here 's some of the bad guy 's lines : " I smell ... teacher ! " " Sorry , teacher ! You get an ' F!'" < br /><br />Bad guy and bad girl ( right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs , they 're getting hot and heavy):<br /><br />Him -"So how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders?" < br /><br />Her- ( purrs ) " You sure know how to show a girl a good time ... " One generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone , gets to sum up his life and personality in this line -"I AM a CHICKEN - TWIT ! ( this was the USA network version ) My old man was right ! No wonder he left us ... " Boo - hoo.<br /><br />(Not actually a spoiler ) Bad guy ( on fire ) screams " Aargh ! Fire ! "
0 I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan . The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite . * Spoiler * even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with : a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub - machine gun , through a high school hallway and the kid wins ? Good game , the Oscar goes to Detention . Dolph , if you 're reading this , thanks for the laughs , old friend.<br /><br />In summary : Terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh . I recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it . Hilarious .
0 Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event , even though he did save many other captive children . The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways , bathrooms and even class rooms . In other words , the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal . Dolph Lundgren,(Sam Decker ) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field . However , the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher . It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB .

0 I was n't expecting a lot from a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren but I was surely expecting more than a got . A one - liner user comment - 2nd rate action movie - did n't seem too depreciative to me for a Lundgren film . On the other hand , I would n't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5.0 but hey , the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 score , which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production.<br /><br />Now I understand that the 37.5 % of people who rated this film a 10 ( excellent ) was clearly a publicity stunt because DETENTION is the regular Nu Image garbage you have seen before , over and over.<br /><br />Lundgren does not convince as an ex - military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school . His acting is just plain terrible , emotionless and contrived . Lundgren 's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids . Either they are great actors or , compared to Lundgren , they seem great actors - just because they seem natural and believable.<br /><br />DETENTION has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie - a closed - for - weekend high - security high school , four teens in detention with a war - veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story ( something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD , or is it PANIC ROOM ? ) is full of unbelievable situations , lots of clichés and stereotypical characters . And let 's not forget Dolph Lundgren is the main actor.<br /><br />Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó play a Bonnie and Clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie , even if he seems a low - budget version of Sam Rockwell and she , a Milla Jovovich wanna - be . In a movie where everything fails , their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero .
0 I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren , whom I had n't seen in any movies since Rocky IV . Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment . The acting of all the parties was bad except for Mr. Lundgren , who was okay - ish . Kata Dobó was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make - up.<br /><br />The plot is not at all clever , it 's something that 's been repeated a million times in different movies . The crooks were utterly stereotypical , and Lundgren 's character had n't any depth in it . I did n't really expect a movie masterpiece , but unfortunately this is not even decent action . Every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over - the - top unrealism and comic - book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon.<br /><br />I would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic - like action , but only if nothing else is available.<br /><br />1/10 . ( I guess the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie )
0 This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks . First thing , what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school ? I think the kids does n't seem to realize the gravity of the situation . Deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line . Where is the responsibility there ? I understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity . Oh yea and none of them knows how to aim . The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy . They all want to look professional but they all suck . One more thing I do n't believe that there 's no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked . What happens if there 's a fire and the dumass security guard is dead ? It is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school . Anyway there 's a lot more to say but it would be too long . I spent some time of my life to watch a crap .
0 Barry , a medical transcriptionist has his mind corroding from his job coupled with memories of an abusive upbringing at the hands of his stepfather , Barry ( the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen ) . He spirals into madness and eventually a serial killer . Good ( in the form of a gay man ) and evil ( in the form of a bald mute guy ) battle for control of his soul . This film is undone by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes . Not to say it 's horrible or anything , just that you cal tell that it 's only as known as it is on account of Bruce Campbell 's rabid fan base ( of which I am one ) who will likely see anything he 's in or involved with in some way.<br /><br />My Grade : C- < br /><br />DVD Extras : Commentary with Michael Kallio , and Bruce Campbell ; Second commentary by Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport ; ' Hating every minute ' a 17 minute documentary ; deleted and extended scenes ; alternate takes ; outtakes , footage of the world premiere ; Poster & still gallery ; Talent bios ; and theatrical trailer < br /><br />DVD - Rom : Screenplay in .PDF format < br /><br />2 Easter Eggs : highlight the eyes for a laughing outtake ( left eye ) and one minute of nothing but an actual Easter egg ( right eye )
0 It took 9 years to complete this film . I would think that within those 9 years someone would have said , hey , this film is terrible . I 've seen better acting in porn movies . The story is tired and played . Abused child turns into serial killer . How about something new for a change . How about abused child turns into a florist ? At least that would have been a new twist . Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea ( especially unoriginal movie ideas ) thinks that they can be a director ? I do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed . That shows tenacity and spirit . With this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script . If you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer / director from Michigan see Hatred of A Minute . If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / director stick with Evil Dead .
0 Casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and/or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on IMDb , one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge . So eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself . One of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie . In this case the term " dark psychological thriller . " Read : " hack writer / director who thinks he 's an auteur , who replaces plot , story , and action , with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul . His great insight ? Festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults . Wow , I bet Freud would be really impressed ! Too many would be film makers like Kallio , who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades , fail to dig their own fresh grave . Instead , they fall into the pre - dug graves of the many other directors that came before them . They are content with rehashing old and tired horror clichés that they borrowed from a dozen or more films . The result is an unoriginal , uninspired , unbelievable waste of film stock .
0 This movie was so predictable . Its a complete rip off of those , " I was abused by daddy I 'm gon na kill women " movies . Stupid scenes , bad acting , unoriginal storyline , really low budget piece of crap film.<br /><br />Don't waste your time people . Trust me.<br /><br />My rating : 0/5.0
0 This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the lot , and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full - length film make . Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor , is made to look so stupid , it 's hard to watch him . As the sly tailor , Robert Morse has n't an ounce of charm . Neither does his hapless nephew ( Jason Carter ) The " songs " are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down . The direction is practically nonexistent , and the supporting characters add very little . Lysette Anthony is pretty as the emperor 's daughter , but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason , a fate shared by many of the minor players . And the film crawls at a snails pace . Hans Christian Andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared . It can honestly be said , at least of this movie tale , it 's no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion .
0 This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager . Now I find it more amusing than scary , but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like . And , come to think of it , the plot is rather disgusting actually ... but handled with some kind of taste . If there is a problem with this movie , it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens . Also , the ending goes on forever , making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming . The " monster " , after it is exposed , is n't very scary either unfortunately . The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it , making it appear as a TV - movie more than something made for theaters . But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic ...
0 Much like the early horror film The Boogens , the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen . Although Animal House 's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest , his performance is more comedy than horror.<br /><br />The plot , an extremely tired one , has three sexy women(Bach , Lamm and Lois Young ) unable to find a hotel for the evening , so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator , exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick . If you have ever seen any horror film , you know that lovable IL ' Sydney is a deranged psycho , so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive , especially Barbara Bach , but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone ) is the only one to go nude , as Sydney watches her take a bath .
0 I purchased this movie at a car boot sale , so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) or The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 ) but I thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch . However , it proved to be not at all enjoyable , but instead the acting and the general movie was mock - able , such as the ways the the ' unsees killer ' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women . It was a stereotypical horror film . I say this because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1 ) Three blonde women in danger , the majority get killed . 2 ) One survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer . 3 ) Surprise surprise , help arrives in the form of a shotgun!<br /><br />By using three simple points , I have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie , so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it .
0 Dreck about three beautiful women in California who go to cover some festival ( or something ) . All the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house . What they do n't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to kill ... <br /><br />Yawn . Boring , pointless , utterly stupid " horror " film . Bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull DULL ! Bach and her friends are no actresses -- their faces are blank all the way through . The final " revelation " is laughably predictable and there 's no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way . There is some expected gratuitous female nudity but that 's not enough to save this . Boring , pointless and unknown ( for good reason ) . A 1 all the way .
0 This movie features an o.k . score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein . The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the " special effects " that this is a low budget movie . There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist , horror / comedy , or low budget movies . Not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either . This movie is simply here . Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well . If you are curious as I was and can actually find this , you will realize the truth of the one line summary .
0 Take your basic Frankenstein flick , inject some Reanimator ( but not the good parts ) , and you have Doctor Hackenstein . Certainly , this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never materializes as anything special on its own.<br /><br />A scientist accidentally kills his wife , so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife . To revive his wife , he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and , coincidentally , decide to stay the night at his place.<br /><br />I ca n't really say the acting is bad , nor is the directing . Everything here is just way too standard . What little attempts there are at humor actually work ( check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle ) , but that 's hardly enough to recommend this film . The music is decent , what blood that 's there is decent , and the cast looks quite good . And for half of the time , I was even entertained by this film . But I never felt like this was anything more than a time waster . Avoidable.<br /><br />Try Frankenhooker instead .
0 Apparently there 's a very good reason why I never heard about " Dr. Hackenstein " before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance . That reason is : it sucks ! It 's a very pointless , dull , imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy / parody . Actually , to be honest , I 'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80 's horror effort . In the year 1909 , at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences , Dr. Elliot Hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more , no less  to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed . She 's only just a living head left now , but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers . So when Dr. Hackenstein yells out " I need three female bodies to bring back my wife " , his words are n't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females ( and one really annoying nerdy kid ) with car trouble show up at his doorstep . Why does n't that ever happen to me ? " I need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem ! ! ! "   See , nothing ! Anyway , the good Doctor sees his wish fulfilled , but unfortunately  for science that is  he develops sympathy for one of the three girls . " Dr. Hackenstein " is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of " Re - Animator " and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic , like a severed head talking one - liners . It 's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere , as it does n't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre . The funniest character is undoubtedly the loud - speaking female grave robber Ruby ; depicted by the anti - cherubic Anne Ramsey . 80 's horror buffs will certainly remember her from Wes Craven 's " Deadly Friend " , where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball . " Dr. Hackenstein " supposedly takes place in the early 1900 's , but there are hardly any attempts to re - create the atmosphere of that era ( except maybe for some automobiles ) . Dr. Hackenstein 's laboratory is a quite clichéd 80 's set piece , with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors .
0 If there was a scale below 1 , it would get a -10 , following in the footsteps of Godspell . The acting ( if there was such a thing ) was atrocious , the plot in shambles . And Rene Russo was sickeningly sweet in her role , enough to make a person retch . Ten thumbs down for a dumb movie . Saving grace : kudos for era costuming .
0 No , it 's not the horror movie ... This one is actually a love story.<br /><br />The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them . She loves the boxer known as " One Round " Jack . She loves him until the champion comes along , that is . Even though she marries One Round , she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between One Round and the champion . She comes back to One Round 's corner , just when things look their bleakest , and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back.<br /><br />This film was very early in Hitch 's career , but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film . Although there are special film tricks , and some comedy relief , this film just does not hold up to any of his later work . It must have been extremely risqué for the time period though , with the shameless adulterous wife . That may have been the draw back in 1927 . While looking through all of these old films , it is amazing how I think that they could be redone on today 's screen and really come off . Maybe I should be the one .... <br /><br />Skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of Hitchcock 's films . You could fall asleep in the middle .
0 I have n't been able to decide if this movie is so bad it 's good , or , to quote Enid Coleslaw , " so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again . " No matter , it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird coloured vomit might , and it offers up a number of scenes that you wo n't forget even if you want to . There 's a sneering young Ray Liotta telling a pigtailed Pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis . A bit later , there 's Ray again , molesting Pia , not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose . There 's a firm chinned Pia telling her domineering Mom that she wants to go to bed with Ray 's geezer father , Walter . There 's the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else : " WWWWHHHYYYYYYY ! " There 's that garden hose again , as Walter waves it Pia 's face and roars " Is this more to your liking ! ? " There 's Pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other masticating salad that they start tearing each other 's clothes off . There 's Pia showering but forgetting to remove her dress . Perhaps best of all , there 's Pia 's typewriter , but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most ( afterwards , I was afraid to open my laptop ) . And finally there 's Pia at " The Awards " exposing Hollywood for the cesspool it is , spitting out the second best line ever , " I guess I 'm not the only one who has ever had to * * * * her way to the top . " I see I have already spent more time commenting on " The Lonely Lady " than I have on far better pictures , so I 'll quit . Be forewarned , though , that once you start watching you probably wo n't be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever .
0 The memory banks of most of the reviewers here must 've short - circuited when trying to recall this Cubic Zirconia of a gem , because practically everyone managed to misquote Lloyd Bochner 's Walter Thornton , when in a fit of peevish anger , he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife , Jerilee Randall - Thornton , ( a nearly comatose Pia Zadora ) which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the movie ... but I 'm getting ahead of myself . In any case , poor Lloyd could 've been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put - upon co - star.<br /><br />Hard as it is for most of us to believe , especially these days , nobody in Hollywood sets out to INTENTIONALLY make a bad movie . This is certainly not the most defensible argument to make , since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out . But then again , there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation , from writing , casting and direction , must 've been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the Ides of March.<br /><br />THE LONELY LADY is in that category , and represents itself very well , considering the circumstances . Here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflé : Pia Zadora , a marginal singer / actress so determined to be taken seriously , that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers , ( which this movie most certainly did ! ) ; a somewhat high - profile novel written by the Trashmaster himself , Harold Robbins ( of THE CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST fame ) ; a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all , that they tried to play this dreck like it was Clifford Odets or Ibsen ; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck , ( and was probably contractually obligated NOT to demand the use of the ' Alan Smithee ' moniker to protect what was left of his reputation . ) Like Lamont Johnson 's LIPSTICK , Meir Zarchi 's I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE , Roger Vadim 's BARBARELLA , Paul Verhoeven 's SHOWGIRLS or the Grandmammy of Really Bad Film - making , Frank Perry 's MOMMY DEAREST , THE LONELY LADY is still often - discussed , ( usually with disgust , disbelief , horrified laughter , or a unique combination of all three ) , yet also defies dissection , description or even the pretzel logic of Hollyweird . Nobody 's sure how it came to be , how it was ever released in even a single theater , or why it 's still here and nearly impossible to get rid of , but take it or leave it , it IS here to stay . And I do n't think that lovers of really good BAD movies would have it any other way .
0 Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago , a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale . There was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was . To this day we still rate movies , even very bad ones , by how much better than " The Lonely Lady " they are.<br /><br />A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry , who wrote the screenplays for , among other things , " Last Summer " and " Diary of a Mad Housewife , " and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins ' book " The Lonely Lady . " She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they did n't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood . She then said " I think they got someone else to write it . " The interview was filmed before the movie was released . She died in 1981 , and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result .
0 There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie . They took a sleazy story , miscast it , miswrote it , misfilmed it . It has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story.<br /><br />As badly as it fails as art , it fails even worse as commerce . Who could have been the target market for this . What age group ? What interest group?<br /><br />Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie . That I would pay to see.<br /><br />I've seen thousands of bad movies , and this ranks with " Sailor Who Fell from Grace " and " Manos " ... my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies I 've ever seen . Everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with VanDamme for all eternity.<br /><br />I challenge you . Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse ? I ca n't think of one way .
0 This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a familiar Harold Robbins formula : ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world , in this case the movie industry . But despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable , this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable . Zadora ( to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable ) never convinces as a screenwriter . One would expect a movie about movie - making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process . But the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters : observance , skill with words , a love - hate relationship with one 's own creative abilities . Her character is as empty as a donut hole . And this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here . The cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening . And the scenes never really hang together , so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood parties . Avoid .
0 Even when I saw this movie at a teenager , I wondered just how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top . As beautiful and sexy as Ms. Zadora is , even she could n't keep this sorry - ass excuse of a movie from tanking . Not even her photoshoot for Penthouse , in which " The Lonely Lady " was promoted " back in the day , " could keep this movie from tanking . The only thing that could have saved this movie ? A completely different script . Give this one a miss .
0 Once again , Pia Zadora , the woman who owes her entire career to her husband , proves she ca n't act . This disaster of a film butchers the Harold Robbins novel . Ray Liotta must have been hogtied and carried to the set to appear in this one.<br /><br />Avoid this at all costs . I doubt even doing the MST3 K thing would save it .
0 I simply could not finish this movie . I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award : a scene in which Pia Zadora , at a picnic , stands between two boys who want her . One ( the good boy ) pleads for her to see the error of her ways . The other ( the bad boy ) simply asks if she 'd like a hot dog , which he then holds out for her . At crotch level . I hope I 'm not spoiling anything to say she turns , and takes the hot dog , with a smile . Just pathetic .
0 This film is a Pia Zadora special ! When viewing it , I was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a Hollywood starlet ; in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for ' B ' movie or soft porn roles ; who says at her casting session " Well of course I do not normally do roles requiring nudity , but if it is artistically necessary for the film ............... " . This recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing Pia at such a session saying " Well of course I do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting , but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol .................. " . This is probably grossly unfair , the rather sordid tale is the fault of Harold Robbins book ; considering the nature of the story Pia 's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention , and perhaps Pia ( who once won an acting award in Butterfly ) is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role . Critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing , but this is grossly unfair ; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties . The real problem with " The Lonely Lady " is that the screenplay , like the original book , looks for sensation rather than substance , and nothing can help with this . < br /><br / > 	 The screenplay for this film is abysmal , but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script , tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement . As it was released , my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether I am assessing my personal opinion , or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing . My personal rating for it would be two out of ten ; but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended , and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable . Being in a charitable mood , and wanting to make it clear that I am not blaming Pia for my disappointment , I will give an IMDb rating of four .
0 The wonderful " Z " Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after " Butterfly " . I had such high hopes for the actress , and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film.<br /><br />Again , it was the 80 's and I got ta tell you Harold Robbin 's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers . Jacqueline Susann ripped into him ( she hated his way of writing women ) , Irwin Shaw 's work caught on with many women , and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70 's early 80 's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books , even more so . Which is why this work smelt . Harold Robbin 's work in the 80 's just did n't catch on with audiences . Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin 's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire . The supporting cast was not a help either.<br /><br />Oooooh ... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later , it looks even worse . I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done . It would be tough for Pia to redeem herself as an actress ( although John Waters casting her in " Hairspray " was a spark ) although she has a nice singing voice.<br /><br />Hey , Pia , wherever you are ... Hairspray may go on tour ! Join the show . You may be the biggest comeback story yet.<br /><br />I just hope they burn this film for ya if you do .
0 The super sexy B movie actress has another bit part as future " Goodfellas " star Ray Liotta 's girlfriend in this box office bomb . She plays Marion , has only one line of dialog , well , one WORD of dialog actually . She shouts out " Joe ! " as Ray 's character is violating poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler . This movie is so bad though it becomes funny , hilarious at times . The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this ! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly Pia 's character is freaking out . Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this . Pia Zadora as a screenwriter ? Yeah , right . Pia can barely talk , let alone write ! Pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role . But who cares ? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her bit part in this cat 's opinion ! Rock on Glory !
0 This is absolutely the worst trash I have ever seen . When I saw it in the theater ( arghhh ! ) , it took 15 full minutes before I realized that what I was seeing was the feature , not a sick joke !
0 Wow ! Only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar " Showgirls . " I mean where to begin ? The indescibably horrid theme song ? Pia Zadora 's non - expressions throughout the movie ? The fact that despite being set in Los Angeles , aka " land of the casting couch " EVERY single man ( and woman ! ) is fawning all over themselves to sleep with Pia Zadora , by any contrived means necessary ? Or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they 're either mind - numbingly stupid ( Pia ) or obvious despicable sleazeball ( everyone else ) ? And given that this flick was written by actual " screenwriters ( sorta ) , it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie - making industry ( who the Hell would admire and kiss up to a SCREENWRITER?)<br /><br />But it 's ( unintentionally ) funny as hell though . The " breakdown " scene alone will have you giggling , and after seeing the climatic " I 'm not the only one who had to * * * * her way to the top " scene at the " Awards " ( all done in the usual bargain - basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as Pia ) , I sincerely hope that our dear Pia actually reused that speech when she " won " her Golden Globe . It 's fitting and that would totally make my day.<br /><br />Anyway , if you 're a fan of bad , tashy camp , give this otherwise tacky movie a try .
0 The truth is that a film based on a Harold Robbins novel is not going to win any awards . This is no exception . " The Lonely Lady " is a pure B picture in budget , cast and execution . Technically , it looks like a made - for - tv film . The acting is very uneven . Joseph Cali is especially terrible . Anthony Holland is an embarrassment . As one reviewer said of a certain Katherine Hepburn performance , her range goes from A to B. Ms Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid ( and wasted in their respective roles ) . Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better . Still , the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way . As befits Robbins , everything revolves around sex and nudity . If you 're looking for some fun ... and you 're not too sober ... this could be for you .

Animals are killed ON camera ( I know it 's faked but it 's still repulsive ) ; a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral ( in a totally sick scene ) ; he 's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom ( I DO wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her ) ; a ghostly jogger ( do n't ask ) tries to help the family for no reason ... The movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face . It just goes out of its way to shock you . * * END SPOILERS**<br /><br />Acting is no help . Midkiff is just dreadful as the father -- he 's handsome and buff but totally blank . Crosby is n't much better . The two kids are just annoying . Only Gwynne single - handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting . < br /><br />This picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things ( especially Midkiff at the end ) . This movie was ( inexplicably ) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992 . I saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what I saw . A sick repulsive horror film . A 1 all the way.<br /><br />When you think it 's all over and ca n't get worse the Ramones sing a title song ! ! ! ! ! ! ( " I do n't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery " ) . Truly beyond belief .
0 Now , I have n't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here , so I 'm not going to go down that path here.<br /><br />But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films , with perhaps a couple of exceptions . This was not one of them . It started well enough , and for once I 'm not going to complain about the acting , although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful .. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills , as they were necessary to make the story here move forward ... <br /><br />But there was one consistent point that I could n't help but get annoyed with . And that came pretty close to the end of the movie , and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity . The moments I refer to are thus : There is a tiny zombie running around the house . You suspect it is under the bed . Do you < br /><br />(a ) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up , exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you , or < br /><br />(b ) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety , or at least see the mini terror coming at you , giving you a little reaction time.<br /><br />I know , let 's go with ( a ) . I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today . Bleh < br /><br />Fun enough film though ... Just not very scary .
0 Stephen King is generally known for the morbid , and that 's fine , but this story is too morbid . Some movies , by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through ... here you just feel depressed . The movie has a nice feel to it ( at first ) , with the family moving to the country , and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery , but this plot leads nowhere . It starts with so much potential , but by the end , it loses the potential to be a good horror movie , and becomes corny , extremely stupid , and ultimately depressing.<br /><br />Louis ( Dale Midkoff ) , his wife Rachel ( Denise Crosby ) , their kids Ellie and Gage , and their cat move to a new home in Maine . They are warned by the loony farmer neighbor Jud ( Fred Gwyne ) about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed . Louis thinks nothing of this and everything 's fine until the family cat is killed . He bury 's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life , constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone . One day , infant Gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck , and Louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery . When Gage comes back to life , he is changed and wants to murder.<br /><br />With many of Stephen King 's works that do n't translate well into films , I blame the directors and screenwriters . In this case , Mr. King was the screenwriter , but I 'm going to blame him for his awful story . By the end it 's so pointless , and though unfunny , the premise is laughable . A little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel , and not only that , but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case , carry a body from the ground to the attic ! ( ? ) I know this is n't set in reality but seriously , how stupid can this get ? The scene where Louis injects his deceased , now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad , because the cat did not deserve this . All it did was go around minding it 's own business and he killed it . The scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable . Not unbearably sad , but the whole situation is just awful to think of . After being injected Gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead .... why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant ? But ... even worse , the actual ending of them film involving Louis burying someone else ( Not going to give away who ) in the cemetery after Gage kills them .... what did he expect ? Why did Mr. King write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie ? It 's depressing and pointless!<br /><br />My rating : * out of * * * * . 90 mins . R for violence .
0 Pet Sematary , though a nice 80 's Horror movie , with a nice Director and atmosphere , IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati . It 's clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director ( the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book)<br /><br />The cat , the ground , everything was copied , this is a case of plagiary , but , being Stephen Kind a famous American writer , it 's totally normal that he can get away with this , it 's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movies with no -budget ( and in part , it 's crap itself ... ) but the original idea , I repeat it , it 's Italian director Avati < br /><br />Let the world know
0 Fot the most part , this movie feels like a " made - for - TV " effort . The direction is ham - fisted , the acting ( with the exception of Fred Gwynne ) is overwrought and soapy . Denise Crosby , particularly , delivers her lines like she 's cold reading them off a cue card . Only one thing makes this film worth watching , and that is once Gage comes back from the " Semetary . " There is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone , and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason . It is absolutely bone - chilling . This film only does one thing right , but it knocks that one thing right out of the park . Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so .
0 " Indian burial ground " : If those three words appear anywhere in a real - estate listing , look for a different neighborhood . A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler - age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery -- and , after a l - o - o - o - ng hike , an ancient Indian burial ground . Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead -- if you do n't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet . It can do the same for dead people -- if you do n't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.<br /><br />Throw in a busy two - lane blacktop , speeding big rigs , a well - meaning ( if somewhat dim ) old neighbor , and one kid who really does n't get enough supervision , and I think you can figure out what happens from there -- an over - the - top , illogical mess , which , in all fairness , does offer up a few scares.<br /><br />Well , there are worse Stephen King adaptations ( such as " Maximum Overdrive , " which King also directed ) . But there are far better ones , too ( such as " Salem 's Lot , " " The Dead Zone , " and both versions of " The Shining " ) .
0 Stephen King adaptation ( scripted by King himself ) in which a young family , newcomers to rural Maine , find out about the pet cemetery close to their home . The father ( Dale Midkiff ) then finds out about the Micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite RIGHT.<br /><br />Below average " horror " picture starts out clumsy , insulting , and inept , and continues that way for a while , with the absolute worst element being Midkiff 's worthless performance . It gets a little better toward the end , with genuinely disturbing finale . In point of fact , the whole movie is really disturbing , which is why I ca n't completely dismiss it - at least it has SOMETHING to make it memorable . Decent supporting performances by Fred Gwynne , as the wise old aged neighbor , and Brad Greenquist , as the disfigured spirit Victor Pascow are not enough to really redeem film.<br /><br />King has his usual cameo as the minister.<br /><br />Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert ( is it any wonder that she 's had no mainstream film work since?).<br /><br />4/10
0 For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding Franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies / funny situations again and again and again . It is to predictable . It is more done as a TV story where you can go away and come back without missing anything.<br /><br />I like Felix Herngren as Frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it 's audience .... <br /><br / >
0 A young couple Mandy Pullman ( Mitch Martin ) and Roy Seeley ( Matt Birman ) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen . They decide to start playing practical jokes on each other . Mandy hides in an old run down cabin , she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant . Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed . Dr. Sam Cordell ( John Cassavetes ) and his daughter Jenny ( Erin Flannery ) are both new to Galen after the death of Sam 's wife . Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden ( John Ireland ) when Mandy and Roy are found . He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries . Soon after a curator at the local museum named Carolyn Davis ( Denise Furgusson ) is also attacked and raped . A local journalist named Laura Kincaid ( Kerrie Keane ) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier . More rapes and murders occur . Meanwhile Jenny 's boyfriend Tim Galen ( Duncan MacIntosh ) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts . Tim 's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus - a shape - shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce ! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film . The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least . Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I 've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly . As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes , but none are shown on screen . There is only one gore scene in the entire film too . The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes . Everything about this film production - wise is very static and flat , the film has no energy or pace . The acting is dull and you do n't feel or care for anyone . Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions . The type of rubbish horror film making that you 'll forget within a day . A real waste of time , do n't bother .
0 Based on Ray Russell 's dark bestseller , this John ( WATCHER IN THE WOODS ) Hough - directed bust has little going for it.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence , it lack narrative sensibility and " characters".<br /><br />The " Incubus " of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or , to be more precise , rape.<br /><br />John Cassavetes , moonlighting from his successful directing career , is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience 's tolerance for slow moving garbage.<br /><br />The script 's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big - Schlong - On - The - Loose exercise .
0 Seriously , I can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood , gore and repulsiveness , but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women . He , John Cassavetes of " Rosemary 's Baby " , talks about ruptured uterus , dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish ( ? ) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine . That being said , " Incubus " is an ultimately STRANGE horror effort . It is n't necessarily awful  although it is n't very good , neither  but just plain weird . The muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist - killer of flesh and blood ( even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature ) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters . None of these characters , especially not the main ones , come across as sympathetic and for some never - explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets . The aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter - love and continuously behaves like he 's a suspect himself , the town 's sheriff ( John Ireland ) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and does n't even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district , the female reporter is even too weird for words and the Galens ( an old witch and her grandson ) are just plain spooky . All together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns ' women reproducing organs . The sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling . Basically these are very positive factors in a horror film , but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for " Incubus " to be a really good film . Also , there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through ( like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert ! ) and the usually very reliable John Hough 's direction is nearly unnoticeable . The final shot is effectively nightmarish , though . For me personally , " Incubus " was a bit of a disappointment , but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80 's horror to open - minded genre fanatics .
0 You know you 're in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half - speed instead of full - throttle in a movie , and " The Incubus " is a dreadful , worst - case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills . Actually , observing the hammy script and John Hough 's ' baroque ' art direction , one can hardly blame him . The movie has something to do with a series of rape - murders going on in a small town , with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in . Somehow , the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene , and Cassavetes seems visibly P.O.'ed at times . The Incubus itself , which does n't show up until the last scene , is a well - done creation , but it 's not worth waiting for.<br /><br />1/10
0 Years ago a movie going friend and I went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred John Cassavetes . For the uninitiated , John Cassavettes was an actor , screen writer and director ( married to actress Gena Rowlands ) , nominated for Oscars three times , who wrote and directed a variety of good low - budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat . Up until seeing The Incubus , we did not understand that John Cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him . Had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether . But we did not walk out . At the time , my friend and I jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made . Now frankly , this is not true . I have seen many poorly made films on Friday nights on Cinemax ( did I just say that out loud ? ) that are far worse than The Incubus . Almost any movie starring Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus . Certainly Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus . However , I have since consistently used The Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall . When talking to this friend about a movie I may have seen I will always remark that it was better ( or worse ) than The Incubus.<br /><br />http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
0 I rented this back in the 80 's and honestly ca n't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is THE worst movie I have ever seen . This is n't one of those " it was so bad , it was funny " . This is n't one of those " it was so gory , it leaves you with a bad feeling " movies . It was n't even one of those " what the heck was that ? " movies . I ca n't recall the performance of the actors , but it was poorly shot , the story was disjointed , and it had no definable style . When it was over , I was angry that I had wasted the time.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of movies I did n't understand because of unfamiliar cultures , styles and/or story - telling , but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties . The incubus has none.<br /><br />I actually contemplated NOT making a comment on this " piece " for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity , but I am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie .
0 " The Incubus " is a mix of the good ( an interesting murder mystery ) , the bad ( a disconnected script , a sloppy resolution , badly made attack scenes ) and the weird ( strong incestuous overtones , a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by John Cassavetes - was that character really meant to be so " wacko " ? ) . Not nearly as offensive as it 's reputed to be , but not particularly successful , either . ( * 1/2 )
0 I 've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well , it surely was n't worth waiting all this time to see it . THE INCUBUS is strictly by - the - number horror film : unseen killer / monster is raping and murdering women in a small town . < br /><br />The film goes like this : movie opens with killing ; then blah blah blah ; more blah blah blah ; then another killing ; even more blah blah blah ; continuing with blah blah blah ; yet another killing ( surprising , huh ? ) ; blah blah blah , etc ... <br /><br />The film is totally predictable from beginning to end . Even the stupid " big " red - herring used throughout the movie would n't convince a 5 year old . And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character , so when the " shocking " surprise ending arrived , I was n't shocked or surprised . In fact , it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie . It 's so silly!<br /><br />Anyway , the film is so by - the - number that the " rock band " sequence is one of the few stand - out moments in this dreary flick . It 's a stand - out scene not necessarily because it 's good but because it 's so funny and pointless : the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video - like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut , all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater 's washroom by the incubus . The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography , which I actually liked . But aside from that , there 's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS , except that it 's unintentionally hilarious .
0 This movie is just plain terrible ! ! ! ! Slow acting , slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just should n't have been on there . The best part was the showing of Iron Maiden singing in some video at a theater and that s it . the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it ! ! The characters in this movie put me to sleep almost . Avoid it ! ! !
0 I run a group to stop comedian exploitation and I just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for , " Last Comic Standing . " If they do n't have a GOOD agent , then they do n't even get a chance to audition so more than 80 % of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent ! If they do make it to an audition , I was told that it 's " pre - determined " if they get a second chance . So what the TV audience sees is NOT the best comics in the US.<br /><br />If the comics do make it to the show , then most of them do n't get IMDb credits . I know this because I did the credits for all 6 seasons of , " Last Comic Standing " and I do n't get paid for doing the Producers ' job . It 's really a disgrace . A month ago , I asked , " Last Comic Standing 7 " on Facebook why the Producers are n't giving IMDb credits and I was banned from their Facebook Page ! ! ! I am not a comedian so I do not have a personal stake in this . I just want people to know the truth . I do n't like seeing ANYONE getting exploited and that 's why I 've been helping the comedians . Comedians get exploited on HBO , BET , TvOne and other cable networks but NBC is a BIG THREE network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen.<br /><br />Please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
0 Do you like stand up ? Then stay away from this ... <br /><br />During the early rounds , there are in fact good comics , but unless they got some cute qualities , they got a snowballs chance . Any controversial material and you are OUT ! ... and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians , when I see who the crooked judges are letting in.<br /><br />1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries . Half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs . Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere , something the judges does n't seem to have problems with.<br /><br />It is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on TV , but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.<br /><br />If the producers changed the name of the contest to " Last Clown Standing " , all my criticism would loose validity . Maybe an idea ?
0 For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline , this one is for you ! From the bleak New York City atmosphere , which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place , to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality , this movie is a real downer . < br /><br />Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood , brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned , wanted to celebrate that fact . Filmmakers then were like an immature six - year - old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store . So , Hollywood gave theater viewers ( for probably the first time ) a dose of rape , prostitution , homosexuality , child nudity , homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing .... and then awarded its work . < br /><br />It also hoped , I 'm sure , to shock mainstream audiences . Well , it succeeded on that level . Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy , proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time , could n't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.<br /><br />Forty years ago , as a very young man , I found this film fascinating , too . However , seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again . < br /><br />The acting was good , but so what ? Acting is good in many films . Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could n't act . Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked - out people . He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era , playing guys like " Ratso Rizzo " in this film and then going to be the " Rain Man " later on . Yes , " Ratso " is a character you 'll never forget , and " Joe Buck " ( Voight ) is one you want to forget , but the story is so sordid , it overwhelms the fine acting.<br /><br />This movie is n't " art , " and it is n't worthy of its many awards ; it only pushed the envelope big - time in 1969 and that 's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics . It 's two hours of profanity and ultra - sleazy , religious cheap shots , glorifying weirdos ( Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise ) , and generally despicable people.<br /><br />I did like the catchy song , " Everybody 's Talking ' " that helped make Harry Nilsson famous , but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better , before Nilsson did it .... and few people have ever heard of Neil ( which is their loss ) . And - as mentioned - the name " Ratso Rizzo " kind of stays with you!<br /><br />The film is a landmark , but in a negative sense , I fear : this marked it as " official " that Hollywood had gone down the toilet , and it has remained in the sewer ever since .
0 David Chase 's " The Sopranos " is perhaps the most over - praised television show in recent memory . Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion , it 's devoid of a soul . As anyone reading likely knows already , James Gandolfini * IS * Tony Soprano , a big , fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife , and two bratty , sh*t - brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America ( that 's New Jersey , by the way ) . Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer , he 's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag , with a crew of " Saturday Night Live " skit - worthy caricatures for subordinates . It 's not the fact that Tony is a piece of sh*t mobster that offends me ( and apparently only me ) . Allowing characters to be who and what they are , without judgment , is something American TV hardly allows . But Chase - and his entourage of money - gorged , Emmy - gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave , nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of ( even obviously fictionalized ) organized crime ( a la " The Godfather " ) . Instead , Chase glorifies and endorses his characters ' greedy , violent , and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony , his wife , and even his hair - brained psychologist do week after week ( or should I say month after month . Or is it year after year ? It seems like the show 's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse ) . Much has been made of the series ' refusal to adhere to " network " structure , with plot lines that go nowhere , and characters that pop - up and disappear like backyard vermin . But if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure , why does it always feel like I 'm watching a soap - opera ? Tired mob clichés , bored housewives , self - serving , irredeemable characters AND plots that go nowhere . More than ever , I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p*ssed at this show . It 's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book ( Danté 's " Inferno " springs to mind).<br /><br />People on IMDb love to claim that there 's nothing good on television , and therefore " The Sopranos " is a breath of fresh air . Are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch " The Shield " ? ( It 's included in Basic , ya know ) . How about the ( still good ) " The West Wing " ? Or the brilliantly acted ( if erratically written ) " Boston Legal " ? What about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades , " Arrested Development " ? And lest we forget that we live in an age of DVDs - nobody * has * to watch * anything * new . I 'd much rather shell out $ 40 for an over - priced boxed set of , well , pretty much * anything * , than give HBO $ 10 a month ( or $ 80 a DVD set ! ) to continue to prove how much of a hack - factory it can be.<br /><br />You want good television ? Watch " Homicide : Life on the Street . " Or " Murder One " . Or " Picket Fences " . Or even Chase 's prior show , " Northern Exposure . " If you 're already among " The Sopranos " 's legion of brain - washed fans and critics , it 's too late for you . But if not , leave Tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes . ( " Sleeping " would be way too kind )
0 Spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands . And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped , he decides to wire his classic car up to explode ( with the money in it ) , which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.<br /><br />Okay , so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife 's involvement with the DA campaign . This I can see , but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit , or even kill them once he 'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence ( e.g , Cini 's body ? ) This was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it . After that , it sort of falls apart .
0 The film " 52 Pick Up " simply does not work . See it if you are at all interested in Elmore Leonard or John Frankenheimer , or anyone in the terrific cast , especially John Glover who 's admittedly brilliant . But the book -- a slow - burning , noir thriller with lots of pulp -- should have translated into an Oscar - contending film instead of this dud that could n't figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard - boiled , gritty crime story of the book , or opt for a 1980s Schwarzenegger shoot - em - up spree . Shifting the scene from the original locale in the book , Detroit ( an area where Leonard has resided for years and knows very well ) , to Los Angeles makes for a substantial problem that Leonard tries to fix in his script , but ultimately ca n't . It was , for example , a clever device making Mitchell 's wife a City Councilwoman ( she had no job in the book ) , if you think about it : that 's the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex - crazed city like 1980s Los Angeles for adultery , or any type of potential sex scandal . Even then , it 's more plausible in a more conservative Eastern state like Michigan to believe that a ) its tiny porno " industry " is a sleazy , money - grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not - so - stupid upper - middle - class fellow going through a mid - life crisis , and b ) adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with , if their upstanding careers and old - fashioned wives could n't handle the shock . As consultant Ron Jeremy will tell you , 1980s Los Angeles was a colorful , stylish porno Mecca , more like the movie " Boogie Nights " than Leonard 's dark , shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses , grimy apartments , and drug deals in depressed urban squalor . Then again , Los Angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully -- there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there . Unfortunately , Roy Scheider 's Harry Mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy , handsome Uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat . In the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing . He also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for , but never appeared to come to grips with . Elmore Leonard 's stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law - abiding citizen . Here , Harry Mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer , Alan Raimy , turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom , makes for such a central image . Glover 's blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence , but Scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky " good guy , " in charge of the situation as if he were more a Rambo with an M-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him . " 52 Pick Up " ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever , considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film . Trapping Raimy inside Mitchell 's Jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by Mitchell , plays to an audience wanting the " sweet revenge " conclusion of a Chuck Norris movie , not the intelligent balanced world of Leonard 's book , where Mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way . I left the theater shaking my head and depressed . What a waste of talent .
0 Vulpine Massacre should have been this movies actual title . And the tag - line should have read " Guaranteed to make your kids CRY ! " This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region . Starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them . The only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den , giving insight into the animals loves and lives ... Lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals . Sounds good huh ? Well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core ... <br /><br / > * * * Spoilers Below - Or they it may be a Warning!***<br /><br />Almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind . But seems to get along well enough and there 's a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him ... And then he dies ... Next we have one of the siblings adventures . And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets her screen - time ... and then she dies ... And so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature , in traps , just up and vanish , and even by a bunch of snowmobiles ! By the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred . Though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen . ( Least not in the version we saw . ) Unlike say " Tarka the Otter " the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out . One or two losses would have been acceptable . It is a nature film after all . But not nearly the whole family.<br /><br />Do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids . Watch it with some foreknowledge that things are * not * going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are . You may enjoy it . Or you may not ...
0 Been lurking for a couple of years or so . I have never been moved to post on here before , so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that , but I doubt it . I just watched it on DVD , having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now . I had not read extensively about it , certainly not even thought about the movie in some months . It was just what the buddy picked up in the store , so it got watched.<br /><br />Bad mistake.<br /><br />The shot I spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster . Right from the off , Jason Statham has hair . Like in no other GR movie . Or any JS movie that I 've seen . At least not in the quantities on display here . And Ray Liotta in underpants SHOULD be advance warned . It 's scary and funny but not in a ha - ha - humour way . Its more in an almost - TheOffice - but - slightly - mutated - and - so - failing - sort - of - humour way . They each say the same thing : " This movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be." < br /><br />Now , based on previous , extensive , movie - watching experience , I expected this movie to be a few things . Like:<br /><br / > ( ) Coherent,<br /><br / > ( ) Interesting or engaging,<br /><br / > ( ) Not a complete and utter farrago of navel - gazing,<br /><br / > ( ) Something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly - realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a " cool , modern , self - aware art - form",<br /><br / > ( ) Hopefully better than " The Idiots".<br /><br />As you may have guessed by my tone , it thoroughly failed to check any box above . Instead it was:<br /><br />(x ) Badly edited { pace all over the shop , 70s - amateur high-8 style jump cuts , incomprehensible " plot " " twists ! ! ! " delivered through hackneyed flash - back montages , I could go on ... },<br /><br />(x ) Shot as if by a depressed 14yr - old goth who 'd just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with the drapes drawn < br /><br />(x ) So up its own behind with the whole " I 'm really smart , me " motif/ message , that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so , just to make sure the dumb people ( ie : everyone who does n't like it ) in the audience make sure they get the point,<br /><br />(x ) A genuine waste of my time.<br /><br />As for the undoubted ability of some people to " get " something from this , fine . I 'm glad you enjoyed it . One poster said something that caught my attention : under-25s probably understood it better because of the editing . Maybe , but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible , not less . As for the " Genius is only recognised by the enlightened " brigade out there , go suck an onion and grow up . There is nothing more presumptuous and self - serving than people who say the reason another person does n't know great art is because they do n't understand the ' craft /materials /moon cycle /filaments of supreme rational thought ' which the ' auteur /poet/ artist/ palm reader/ idiot savant ' is using to explain his or her ' vision /grand scheme /oneness with Gaea /great big bucket of dog - sick'.<br /><br />For me and many , many more people , its garbage . < br /><br />Movies , art , stories , poetry , anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving . In some direction be it metaphorical , spiritual , emotional or whatever you 're having yourself.<br /><br />The only way this moved me was forward in time , two hours closer to my own inevitable demise . " The greatest trick He ever pulled was making You believe Any Part of this movie meant Anything at All" < br /><br />And now , please , by all means , toast my buns for me .
0 Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time . It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience . I have to say that while I agree films do n't have to make sense to be enjoyable ( see MULHOLLAND DRIVE ) they still have to engage you with the characters . Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch 's opus , I have to say I could n't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world . < br /><br />Also , while so many people seem to try and say you did n't enjoy because you did n't get it I would have to disagree - I did n't enjoy because I was bored . I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help . Call it clever if you will - I think it 's repetitious.<br /><br />However , my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw . Just music over black . Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR 's pretentiousness ? Or , did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed ? ? ?
0 What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that . Guy Ritchie , a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre , bites off more than he can chew with this one.<br /><br />His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride , being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it 's face . When Jason Statham 's character no longer fears Ray Liotta , it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene . Why ? Basically you can not set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character , who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film , only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham 's character.<br /><br />Before anyone starts to say I 'm missing the point ... I 'm not . I get it OK ? Opt out of the quest for riches & you 'll find true happiness and inner peace . Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self - destruction . This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story , although hardly original . The problem is that Ritchie simply does n't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off . At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this , he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red - herrings : The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why ? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations ... again , why?<br /><br />There are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out , or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way . Myself ? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply did n't care . Frankly the ending could n't come too soon so that I did n't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble.<br /><br />A waste of two hours of my life .
0 Guy Richie 's third proper film ( not counting the God - awful " Swept Away " is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling , gangsters and chess . Fans of Richie 's previous efforts will probably hate Revolver as much as I did , with its twists and turns . Richie stalwart Jason Statham plays Jake , a newly - released ex - con , out to wreak revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha ( a superbly OTT Ray Liotta ) but instead gets embroiled with a couple of other cons , ( one of which is Andre 3000 from rap outfit Outkast ) who throw him and us the audience , a number of red herrings throughout the film , all of which becomes extremely tedious . The high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant , where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot , slow - mo shootout set to Beethoven 's Moonlight Sonata . All in all , Revolver is a flawed work , not truly awful but far from Richie 's best . That would still be Lock , Stock . If this film was a school homework assignment it would be graded ' must try harder ! '
