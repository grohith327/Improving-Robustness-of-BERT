1 This has to be one of the best , if not the best film i have seen for a very , very long time . Had enough action to satisfy an fan , and yet the plot was very good . I really enjoyed the film , and had me hooked from start to finish.<br /><br />Added blood and gore in there , but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film , and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think.<br /><br />It is a must watch for anyone . Seen many reviews , slating the film , but to be fair , most the films that get bad reviews , turn out to be some of the best . this proves it once again.<br /><br />Rent this film , buy this film , just go out and watch this film . You will not be disappointed .
1 I loved this movie . I 'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it . In fact , I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico . It 's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse . It angers me to read in the news how killers , kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells . We should have someone like Creasy , Denzel Washington 's character . A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante . Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here ( at least in the big cities ) . I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one 's Creasy did his fine job upon . That would be so marvelous ( Sorry , I am THAT resentful ! ) . MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you ca n't miss . It might be hard on some of you , if you are n't used to reading subtitles ( Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies ) but the effort will be well worth it . Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy ... kind of like TRAFFIC , remember ? ( another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is ) . The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half . I swear you 'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers . His performance is nothing short of Excellent . The ending ( no spoilers , OK ! ! ! ) is a bit sad , but I 'm sure you 'll like it anyway . MAN ON FIRE is one of the year 's best movies . A " must own " for a DVD collection ! 9 * out of 10
1 This is by far one of the better made movies and did n't leave me disappointed at all . The sound track along with finely shot hand - held camera work was exquisite . The are always chances a movie wo n't hold ones beliefs as well as another , but I felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent . Dakota Fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent . As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light .
1 Mean - spirited , ugly , nasty retro - action thriller , about a bodyguard who is determined to find ( and destroy ! ) , the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect . This film is almost an anachronism in today 's politically correct atmosphere . Director Scott does n't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film 's dramatic structure . Scott is either not aware or does n't care for 30 years of social advances . I really do n't think we will see a more violent film any time soon , so you better go and see this one while you can . Despite its relentless grimness , I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister , exploitative , and effective . Scott has a tough thing to sell , but I think I 'm a buyer . The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore . Scott 's directorial choices are simply astonishing , and he pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington . Sensitive souls need to stay away from this one , but I recommended it to those viewers looking for a great , action - filled movie .
1 Here 's a gritty , get - the - bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough Denzel Washington . He 's three personalities here : a down - and - out - low - key - now drunk- former mercenary , then a loving father - type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.<br /><br />The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico , where kidnappings of children occur regularly ( at least according to the movie . ) He becomes attached to the kid , played winningly by THE child actress of our day , Dakota Fanning . When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him , Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one . Beware : this film is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />This is stylish film - making , which is good and bad . I liked it , but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera - work is one that could give you a headache . I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view , but it 's ( the shaky camera ) not for all tastes.<br /><br />Besides the two stars , there is the always - interesting Christopher Walken , in an uncharacteristically low - key role , and a number of other fine actors.<br /><br />The film panders to the base emotions in all of us , but it works .
1 i liked this film a lot . it 's dark , it 's not a bullet - dodging , car - chasing numb your brain action movie . a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague , leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions . it 's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.<br /><br />in the end , motivated by love or vengeance , or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is " right " . ' will god ever forgive us for what we 've done ? ' - it 's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do , what he 's good at , what he 's been trained to do.<br /><br />denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly ca n't think of one bad movie he 's done - and he 's got a great supporting cast . i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone .
1 There are many reasons to watch this movie : to see the reality that whips Latin America with regard to the kidnappings thing , the police corruption at continental level , among so many realities that we live the Latins . < br /><br />The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant , this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way . Dakota Fanning just by 10 years , an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her . The rest of the movie was of marvel , I have it in my collection . < br /><br />I hope that they are happened to those producing of Hollywood to make a movie completely in Venezuela , where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency , the traffic of drugs or the political problems . They have been few the movies that they play Venezuelan land ( for example : Aracnophobia , Jungle 2 Jungle , Dragonfly ) they should make more , as well as they make in Mexico.<br /><br />The song " Una Mirada " I hope that it leaves in the soundtrack , it is excellent . My vote is 10/10
1 Although released among a flock of revenge - minded action flicks ( KILL BILL VOL . 2 ; THE PUNISHER ; WALKING TALL ) , MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always - watchable Denzel Washington , one of the best actors around today.<br /><br />In MAN ON FIRE , based on A.J. Quinnell 's 1980 novel ( first filmed in 1987 , with Scott Glenn ) , Washington plays a down - on - his - luck ex - mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels , until his old partner ( Christopher Walken ) offers him a chance at redemption . He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year - old daughter ( Dakota Fanning ) of a Mexican businessman ( Marc Antony ) and his American - born wife ( Radha Mitchell ) . While he and Fanning work like oil and water first ( not mixing very well ) , he really gets to form a bond with her , encouraging her to do better at swimming , while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past . It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $ 10 million ransom , and he is nearly killed . With almost any other stock action hero ( Schwarzenneger ; Segal , etc . ) , the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we 've seen a million times before . But Washington 's character , though he 's killing for a reason , does not particularly enjoy doing what he does . Still , he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter ( Rachel Ticotin ) out to expose " La Hermanidad " ( The Brotherhood ) , the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning 's abduction.<br /><br />MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work , nearly headache - inducing montage editing , and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott ( TOP GUN ; CRIMSON TIDE ) , but which are not necessarily unique to him ( witness Oliver Stone 's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah 's in his classic 60s and 70s films ) . Still , Scott gets a very good performance from Washington , as well as Fanning , who comes across as far more than a typical movie - brat kid . Harry Gregson - Williams ' south - of - the - border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin , Debussy , and even Linda Ronstadt 's classic 1977 country - rock version of " Blue Bayou . " Although the film overall is quite violent , it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years , and overall it is much better than most .
1 You know you 're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he is n't even one of the bad guys ! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there , " Man on Fire " is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Creasy , a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he 's committed . So far , he 's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either . As the movie opens , Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well - to - do , possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community . Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety . The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge , Pita , a sweet little girl who , slowly but surely , works her way into Creasy 's initially hardened heart and affections . The last two - thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama , as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.<br /><br />Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell , " Man on Fire , " astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott , is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter . It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is , for all intents and purposes , achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering ( admittedly disreputable ) people . These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful , even if they do at times border on the exploitative . Even better are the quiet , intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie . Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural , easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.<br /><br />Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness , making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually . In addition to the two leads , there are solid performances from Walken , Marc Anthony , Radha Mitchell , Mickey Rourke , Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini . But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.<br /><br />"Man on Fire " would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time , but this is still a better - than - average crime thriller .
1 -Kidnappings in Mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you 're rich then you 'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe . A couple hires a washed up bodyguard called Creasy to protect their adorable kid Pita . At first , their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while , Creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father / daughter relationship . One day Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is badly injured in the process . When he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets Creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice.<br /><br />-Keep some Tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it . I really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right . The only problem is the annoying visual style , which will either make you hate the movie or hate Tony Scott . I really feel sorry for the cinematographer because I 'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the DP for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it 's been possessed by demons . I would n't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it 's spread through out the whole movie then that 's when we have some problems . The same annoying style was recently used on " Domino " and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie.<br /><br />-Another person I feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great Harry Gregson Williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images . Somehow , Williams wrote some decent music for the movie but I 'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better . The sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience , it rather makes you feel like you 're being punished . The overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it . I do n't know why Scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie.<br /><br />-The acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals . Little Fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart . If the end of the movie does n't make anyone cry then they 're dead on the inside . Denzel Washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily , for him he gets to play a great character . The whole idea of a man that 's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but Washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character . I love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge . Radha Mitchell plays Marc Anthony 's wife and she along with Fanning are the two reasons why I ca n't hate the movie too much . J.Lo 's husband comes and goes in the movie but he does n't really stand out much . Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact.<br /><br />-One thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray Mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie . A little too late for that if you ask me . Let 's hope that Tony Scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him CAN and must do better than this .
1 When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it . It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview , its stunning , and then when it comes out , you hear nothing and totally miss it , and your memory totally does n't correct the mistake of missing it . Man On Fire was one of those movies . I was curious on a rental one time , and I decided to take it home with me , my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands . I watched it , and witnessed such a beautiful movie . It is like none other ... drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular . The cinematography done by Tony Scott is extremely well done and unique , unlike another movie . The subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices , and the music is very intriguing for the setting . I got into this movie , and ended up buying it as soon as I could scurry out of the household and head over to Best Buy . I 've watched it several times now . Denzel Washington ( Creasy ) does an amazing job with becoming this lost - minded ex - special forces man with no reason to live . Dakota Fanning ( Pita ) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start . They bond and become good friends , until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood , La Hermandad . Creasy ( Denzel ) tells the mother of Dakota Fanning that he will hunt down the killers , fearing that Pita is dead . This is where Creasy really shows the person he can become . He uses his contacts from Pita 's kidnapping and Creasy 's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit . My favorite line of all , is in this movie , when Christopher Walken tells the AFI agent that " A man is a work of art , in anything that he does .... cooking , whatever . Creasy 's art is death ... he 's about to paint his masterpiece . " He plays a very unique roll of Creasy 's old partner and friend . After finally pursuing the brother of " The Voice , " leader of La Hermandad . Creasy arranges a meeting to trade Pita for himself and The Voice 's brother . In the end , Creasy dies from being shot earlier , and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss . It is a very sincere and sad ending , but a great one . I love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick . The story is in depth , everything is explained from beginning to end , and nothing corny at all in any way or manner .
1 I get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies , and they were not disappointed when I watched this one . I cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness . I ached for the family and I ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how . Denzel was fabulous as always , and so was Chris Walkin . Mickey Rourke , I did not even recognized though ; the years have not been kind to him . My husband is not one to re - watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies(snore ! ! ! ! ) He has watched this movie 5 times now and I am going to have to get the DVD to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time I was watching .
1 Man on Fire was hot . I love a classic tale of good ol' revenge , and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.<br /><br />The writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between Creasy ( Denzel Washington ) and Pita ( Dakota Fanning ) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive Creasy had to rescue Pita . It was also good that Creasy was n't a choir boy type trying to rescue Pita through the " proper " channels , but instead used torture tactics and street smarts . Some may say , " Torture is wrong regardless , " and you may be right , but when you see the pain Creasy goes through due to the loss of Pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back , you ca n't help but side with Creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless . There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that.<br /><br />Creasy 's quest ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys . But Creasy 's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie , it in fact enhanced it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back . His death was noble in fact.<br /><br />Denzel does an excellent job as do the writers . This movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie .
1 This is an excellent , heartbreaking movie . It is by far the best I 've seen that depicts the current reality in Latin America ... kidnappings , corruption , ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims . Denzel Washinton gives the most moving performance in his career , in my opinion . Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress . The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed , I believed every minute . The cast is brilliant , Christopher Walken , Mickey Rourke are great as always . Walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor . I would have loved to see more of both of them . The authentic locations are remarkable . The camera work is interesting and different . There are many famous Latin actors in the cast , making it all the more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema . I highly recommend this movie .
1 This comment does contain spoilers!!<br /><br />There are few actors that have an intangible to them . That innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma , panache and swagger . It 's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great . I think George Clooney has it and so does Jack Nicholson . You can look at Clooney 's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good - bye to Andy Garcia in Ocean 's 11 when they just utter each other 's name disdainfully . " Terry . " " Danny . " You can pick any number of Jack 's performances dating as far back as Five Easy Pieces in the diner to A Few Good Men and his court room interrogation scene . These guys just have it . You can add Denzel Washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does . If you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in The Siege to his impressive tribute to Malcolm X in Spike Lee 's film of the same name , you can see that there is no finer an actor working today . I do n't mention all of this to insinuate that Man On Fire is perfect just because of Denzel 's work , but he is definitely the cog of the production . I was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw , emotional and incendiary all at the same time.<br /><br />Washington plays Creasy a former spy or CIA agent or one of those covert government operatives . He has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led . He has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man . His friend and perhaps mentor , played very reservedly by Christopher Walken , is living in Mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich . Apparently the kidnapping business in Mexico is so vibrant that these paid former S.E.A.L.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service . Creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty . Marc Anthony is fine as Samuel , Radha Mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife Lisa and Dakota Fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as Pita . I do n't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of Pita is nothing short of Oscar worthy . The film 's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between Pita and Creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role , perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly . But Fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role.<br /><br />It is the relationship between Pita and Creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema . Together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them . Tony Scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better . I am interested to see how his next film , Domino , turns out . I think Scott is one of today 's under rated directors and with more films like this one , his name will surely be elevated to icon status.<br /><br />The story has Creasy really taking to Pita , and vis - ca versa . There is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although Pita loves her dad , he is not around much . He is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family . Soon , Creasy is taking Pita to her swimming competition . He is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear " Creasy " . It 's not just a friendship between them , it is more of a kinship , and a deep parental love seems to be present . < br /><br />The film changes gears when Pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and Creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her . This is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion . And this is where Denzel becomes a tour de force . Like I said earlier , I have seen Denzel give some outstanding performances in films like Crimson Tide and Training Day , but never have I seen him like this . He is a man possessed and with the possibility of Pita being dead , he becomes a literal man on fire . It rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance . Denzel 's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for Pita 's violation . This all vigilante justice as the Mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind . < br /><br />Also what is paramount to this film 's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance . I have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily . They inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die . But not in this film . Writer Brian Helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful . The perpetrators here feel Creasy 's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes . There is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice . He needs information and someone loses a finger . He wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things . There is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film.<br /><br />Man on Fire is one the five best films of 2004 . Now that it is out on DVD , my recommendation is to get the SE . It is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks . 10/10
1 Man on fire , is definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I have ever seen . Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well . This is Denzel Washington 's perfect role , in which he plays a body guard , called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée , Pita . Dakota Fanning plays Pita , the very smart , enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things , and acts in a very convincing manner , she has a great future ahead of her . As I said the story is somewhat complicated , in order to fully understand it , you must watch it a couple of times.<br /><br />This film is made in two parts , there 's the first hour , where everyone is happy , nothing 's wrong , everyone 's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed . And then there 's the second part , the rest of the film , where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing , when Creasy 's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and " La Hermamdad " that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita.<br /><br />Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them . It is a real shame that this film has n't been acknowledged enough , Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance , and so did Fanning and the director . And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.<br /><br />If you like excellent , slightly deranged , suspenseful thrillers , this is the one to see . The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters ! 10/10
1 It 's hard to top this movie in several ways . Everything works really well here ; the casting , acting , script , and cinematography are all first - rate . For the moviegoer , it 's a moving , violent story of love and human redemption . For the film critic , there 's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit . There are some tactical blunders , and as has been discussed on the boards , the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle . However , I took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the CIA agent 's pragmatic approach , Creasy basically commends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences . Like Jesus Himself , Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice , whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not . In any case , I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice , which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent . < br /><br />In any case , this film is very much worth watching if you 're at all attracted to the genre . An excellent soundtrack , great writing , flawless casting , and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 ( or better ) film .
1 I am amazed that movies like this can still be made . I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen . Never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on.<br /><br />Washington , charismatic and intense as ever , plays Creasy , a washed - up ex - counter - terrorist agent who 's taken to the bottle . Once he 's assigned to protect young Pita ( Dakota Fanning ) in Mexico City , his emotional and redemptive arc is jump - started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide . Inevitably , Pita is kidnapped by thugs , and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take away his character 's teddy - bear - clutching catalyst . Yes , he has become ... a Man on Fire . < br /><br />You must see this movie .
1 In Mexico City , the former CIA assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man John Creasy ( Denzel Washington ) is hired by the industrialist Samuel Ramos ( Marc Anthony ) , with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn ( Christopher Walken ) , to be the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita ( Dakota Fanning ) and his wife Lisa ( Radha Mitchell ) . Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy , making him live and smile again , and he feels a great affection for her . When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals , he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction.<br /><br />"Man on Fire " is almost a masterpiece , and will become certainly a classic in the future . The story is excellent , never corny and although having 146 minutes running time , the viewer does not feel time passing . The cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses , their performances are outstanding , highlighting Denzel Washington , Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell . The cinematography has wonderful moments , and the screenplay has stunning lines . I personally loved when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano ( Giancarlo Giannini ) that Creasey 's specialty is death , and he is preparing his masterpiece . I agree with the user that commented that " Man on Fire " is one of the best , if not the best , film of the year in this genre . My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Chamas da Vingança " ( " Flames of the Revenge " )
1 Man On Fire tells a story of an ex - special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom . At first he 's not to friendly , but then they befriend with each other , he decides to stop drinking etc . , etc ... then one day she gets kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /><br />And HE , wo n't stop at anything to get the revenge.<br /><br />That 's basically the story of Man On Fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.<br /><br />That 's also because of the great music Harry - Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard ( Gladiator ) composed.<br /><br />But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... the thing is , everything here is perfect.<br /><br />First - acting . Denzel Washington is at his best , Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always , great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning . And that 's not the end of the list ... <br /><br />Then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing , should have won an Oscar for sure.<br /><br />The story is ... not just a revenge movie . The story is intelligent , the story makes you think ... and is pure beautiful . Really.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime , at least once !
1 Tony Scott can make good films and bad , personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother , but this is quite possibly his best film.<br /><br />What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel ( on scorching form , better than Training Day ) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness . The set up is absolutely NOT boring , although it takes time - it is involving , and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother . This all serves to make the action so much more effective , as we are so invested in the characters , for all their all too obvious weaknesses . This film has you on the edge for its entirety , and does n't cop out at the end either.<br /><br />The film would of course be nothing without Washington . I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles , when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there ( I can only really think of one , Daniel Day Lewis , who has more on - screen power these days ) . This film should have been huge , given his status and the strength of his performance , and the quality of the film . It just goes to show you that if a studio does n't back a film to the hilt , it ends up going straight to video . I wish I 'd got the chance to see this on the big screen .
1 This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion . Sorrow , love , laughter , anger . There are so many emotions thrown into this film . From start to finish this film is immensely captivating . The plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences but do n't be mistaken , this film is powerful . Washington as always puts on a great performance.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell : man suffers from depression , a young girl brings life into him , kids gets kidnap , man wants revenge . Does n't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there . For instant , TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both , MAN ON FIRE wins hands down . The characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great . Mexico City feels alive , it looks like Mexico city , it smells like Mexico city . Everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico City < br /><br />This is one of those films you 'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you 'll beg your family and friends to watch . From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist , making it a roller - coaster journey . There enough action to keep you happy , there enough character development to please you and then there 's Washington to bring a smile to your face . Watch this film , you wo n't be disappointed
1 Basically , the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two Scotts(Ridley and Tony ) . Let 's make it straight , the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner / thriller ever made.<br /><br />When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes , Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo . Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect . Washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie . One would easily be related to his character 's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road . It 's a success that they created a super - dark Mexico city with a lot of shits happening . One would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire . I do n't know what would the Mexicans think when they watch this ...... <br /><br />Well , let 's face it again . It 's among the best of the Death Wish genre , but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence . It 's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the " missing sheep " type of tragic hero . In the end , they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary . I was checking on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for that ...... So that 's for your consideration if you also finds the movie 's theme is a little bit phony.<br /><br />At the end , I hope one would not take this movie for real.<br /><br />8/10 for art direction / editing / cinematographic / Denzel Washington .
1 Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action , mayhem , murder and grisly bloodletting . The essentials are a bodyguard 's search and destroy mission as his charge , young Dakota Fanning , is kidnapped from school , which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent . The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable , violent conclusion , with plot twists along the way . Washington , a former CIA operative with a drinking problem , gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot 's outline . Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning , the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends . Christopher Walken , Rachel Ticotin , Radha Mitchell , Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars .
1 I just love Malle 's documentaries . They are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating . I have no idea why this documentary works . It is about Glencoe , Minnesota . 5000 people live there and nothing happens , really . But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting . His love for humanity , even racist or homophobic people , is so overwhelming that you just ca n't help but also to fall in love with them too . < br /><br />Malle filmed most of it in 1979 . He came back 6 years later to see what had changed . This would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great . It may sound like Malle was just doing what has been done in the Up series but in fact it is not . The Up series are about people . Malle 's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community . And the change is great . 1985 is the Reagan era and the farmers are suffering . Once a proud community , now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming . < br /><br />This documentary is quite relevant today . Our financial crises today started because of what was happening then . Just take a look to these final words in the film , spoken by an older lawyer from the town ( in 1985):<br /><br />"Well I have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed . And a nation does n't live long with that obsession . And particularly a democracy that ... There 's good - there 's good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they are n't gon na - they are n't gon na subscribe to this philosophy of greed that 's going on now . It 's horrible." < br /><br />Unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened .
1 I found this film to be the usual French slap in America 's face . The camera , all too often , focuses on fat people , on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas . While the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer , the cinematography exploits and demeans them . There were , undoubtedly , thin people to be seen in Glencoe and neat , organized homes , but Malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen . < br /><br />I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal to the American public its worst elements . I can assure you , as a frequent visitor to France , that all is not well there . Foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated , thus creating severe social inequities . But Americans are not eager to unmask the French for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the U.S. , so we 're not likely to see films on the subject .
1 Maybe I 'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever ! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5 , and I cried my eyes out . Between then and now ( embarrassed at age 15 ) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them . Do n't worry they 're tears of happiness ! And it 's not all sap ! There 's a lot of humor and comedy in it too . Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it 's not the case . My only word of advice : Even if you love this - Don't see the sequal ... cornyness ! I suggest everyone checks this out ... you wo n't be sorry , no matter how old or young you are !
1 I watch this movie all the time . I 've watched it with family ages 3 to 87 , and everyone in between ; They all loved it . It really shows the true scenes a dog has , and the love and loyalty you get from a pet . Just beautiful.<br /><br />It 's great for thoes who love comedy movies , the tear - jerker movies , or even just pets.<br /><br />The music is wonderful , the animals spectacular , the scenes truly thought out , and the characters perfect . What I liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities : Shadow ( The oldest , a Golden Retriever ) He 's the wise one , filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog , Chance ( the American Bulldog puppy ) is basically a puppy with a witty side , the comical character ; And Sassy ( The Hymilayan cat ) She 's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner , the real girly one .
1 This is a great movie for all ages . Its the story about three animals how have to find their way home . There is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie . You never know what is going to happen next . This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh . You just do n't know what going to happen next . The trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes . They producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too . The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors / actress themselves . Everything about this movie is great ! 10 out of 10 the whole way ! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee you will love it the whole family will !
1 This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites . The voices for the animals are wonderful . Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch , but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old , faithful golden retriever . This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults . Humorous and suspenseful , and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry ! ( happy tears ! )
1 Homeward Bound is a beautiful film . Y'know the part where Shadow falls down the ditch ... thingy , I * cried * , considering I was only six , I cried ! it takes a lot to make me cry ! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained . A nice family movie , * not * for completely hardened non - fluffy people or animal - haters but could for soft - as - crap a.k.a . people like me.<br /><br />A good film overall , 10/10 !
1 I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and did n't really think it was anything particularly special . AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film , which i will come to later . For a while i left this film alone and did n't watch it for a while . When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago ( now being 15 ) , I dug out the VHS of homeward bound . After watching this i was left on a natural high that i could n't really explain . The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect . The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground , something that you all need . The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic . In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever , looking after or guiding ' chance ' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog , with sassy the clever , vulnerable but confident cat . The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen . < br /><br />I do n't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite , but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return , when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy , painfully are told by him to leave . When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all . There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 . This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10 .
1 This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made . It 's a real pleaser to anyone . It 'll make you laugh , it 'll make you cry , and it 'll put you into suspense.<br /><br />Basically , what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation . They do n't know what is going on , and desperately wanting to go home , they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.<br /><br />This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in . He provided the voice of Shadow , the old , wise and friendly golden retriever . Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy , the Himalayan cat . But seriously , what this movie is all about is Chance ! Voiced by Michael J. Fox ( my all - time favorite actor ) , Chance is basically all you 'd expect from a dog , lovable , playful , energetic and goofy , and every time I crack up when watching this movie , it 's because of Chance ; it 's like the comedy never ends ! < br /><br />This movie is also very sad at times . It sometimes reminds people of the times they 've been alone or when they lose their pets.<br /><br />One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound ; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost does n't make it . The movie had other suspenseful moments , but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.<br /><br />Overall , it 's a wonderful family movie . If you enjoyed this movie , you 'll probably enjoy the sequel too . I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 !
1 As a kid I thought this movie was great . It had animals , it had beautiful music , and it had my favorite actor : Michael J. Fox . Now , I still love this movie , for different reasons . It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera . It has beautiful , well - written musical that fits the scenes perfectly , with rousing fast - paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme , that still makes me cry . Even when people hum it . And it has my favorite actor , Michael J. Fox . < br /><br />Based on a book , this is the story of three house pets , an intelligent , overly - trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow , a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street - smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog , Chance . The three are taken to a friend 's farm when their family goes away . Dismayed and worried , the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives . A truly incredible journey . So what , maybe home IS just over that mountain . But what if it is n't ? < br /><br />I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters , and for anyone else that ... yeah , everyone go watch it .
1 This movie was awesome ... it made me laugh , it make a bawl , and most of all it has talking animals in it ! ! this movie should be seen by all kinds of people ! it is one of my favorite movies , and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on it!!!it rox ! it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt movie!my favorite character is shadow . this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming . i used to have a golden retriever just like shadow , i miss him so much ! ! ! he was my best friend and i knew that when he died , he would be in a happier place , but i miss him with all of my heart ! ! this movie is the best i love it and everyone should ! Love your pets no matter what they do , cherish them forever ! ! !
1 It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I do n't really like dogs . Fox , Field , and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance , Sassy and Shadow , and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing.<br /><br />I have seen this movie 72 times already ( I know that sounds scary , but it 's true ! ) , and every time the ending scenes still get me . I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers . It is indeed my all - time favorite movie !
1 I 've seen this about 2 or 3 times and have n't regretted it . Homeward bound is not just a typical animal movie . Its unique , fun and bursting with adventure . The things that make it a fun movie are the animals ( obvious)who are wonderfully trained . A very good effort.<br /><br />8.5/10 !
1 Very few so called " remakes " can be as good as the originals . This one crosses that border with flying colors . Just a remake , I do n't think so ! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine , and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film . < br /><br />The film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart . The earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie , but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film . This update is more epic and cinematic . Still , I thoroughly recommend both films.<br /><br />This film is certainly a must - see for an animal lover . We have the wise old Golden Retriever , Shadow ; the sharp , sarcastic Himalayan cat , Sassy ; and the young , fun - loving American Bulldog , Chance . The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche , Sally Field , and Michael J. Fox , respectively.<br /><br />There is virtually nothing offensive in the film . There is a bit of scatological humor , but nothing extreme . No hard violence , save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall , an angry porcupine , and a dark railroad shaft.<br /><br />Hilarious , scary , moving , and above all real , it surprised me to see that this film did n't win any awards , not one . Nevertheless , I will have to say this is just as good as some of the Best Picture nominees nowadays .
1 " Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey " is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets . Deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general , together with other animal movies like " Old Yeller " , " Napoleon " , " Fluke " and " Air Bud " . This means it is more than just a movie about pets.<br /><br />Can this possibly be just a " remake " ? It is too good to be a " remake " ! I know this one by heart , since my early teen years ( when I was 12).<br /><br />It 's a family movie to treasure . It 's emotional , thrilling , adventurous , exciting , entertaining , humorous , charming , sweet , nostalgic , beautiful , heartwarming and sometimes dramatic . It 's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films.<br /><br />This movie does not lack qualities . It has a well thought story , enjoyable characters , excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack , dazzling sceneries / landscapes of the magnificent Sierra mountains ( in Oregon ) . Speaking of the vistas , it 's not all mountains : forests , trees , rivers , waterfalls , sunsets ... in conclusion , all of pure nature 's wonders - truly a full panorama . < br /><br />The main human characters are nice , well developed and well portrayed by respective actors . Robert Hays is awesome as the kind - hearted dad , Bob Seaver . Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford . Veronica Lauren is equally good as Hope . Kevin Chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother Jamie ( his appearance actually reminds me very much of Kevin Corcoran in " Old Yeller " ) . Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford.<br /><br />When it comes to our quadruped pals , Shadow is my favorite . Shadow is the loyal , wise , mature , beautiful , caring and loving old Golden Retriever ( brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche ) . Chance , the American Bulldog , is the opposite of Shadow . He is carefree , silly , impatient , anxious , clumsy , hilarious and loves to play ( voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox ) . Chance just ca n't stand still . Sassy is the epitome of cats 's image : elegant , independent , very confident and self - proud , with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm . Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat , one of the most beautiful cat breeds . Sassy is voiced by Sally Field , who also does a good job.<br /><br />Our four - legged friends are , themselves , great " actors " by nature : Ben as Shadow , Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy.<br /><br />It 's an underrated movie , but a classic by its own right . Its sequel is clearly inferior.<br /><br />This should definitely be on Top 250 .
1 There have been countless talking - animal films in the past , the majority of which either feature animals ' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting , or are ridiculously amateur . ' Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey ' is neither.<br /><br />This film does n't need the infant - pleasing addition of moving canine lips , or gesturing feline limbs . It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another , and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart ( as all great boy - and - and - his - dog films should).<br /><br />Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family - friendly animal romps to me , and boasts some beautiful cinematography , an inspiring soundtrack ( from the genius of Bruce Broughton ) , and an impressive cast ... <br /><br />Michael J. Fox ... Chance < br /><br />Sally Field ... Sassy < br /><br />Don Ameche ... Shadow < br /><br />Frank Welker ( Voice God ) ... Various < br /><br />It is a modernised version of the children 's classic work of fiction ' The Incredible Journey ' , which was made into a semi - documentary film by Disney long long ago in 1963 . The sequel ( Lost in San Fransisco ) is n't nearly as good a film , but extends the adventure of my favourite furry - footed friends , and is a fun urban - twist on the grand - outdoor - adventure theme . Want to entertain your children with a witty , pretty , heart - warming mini - epic , without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children 's cinema ? Parents , buy all three films for your children - now ! Thank you , Disney , for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time I watch this early-90s classic !
1 This is a really cool movie ! I remember first seeing it when I was really young and I used to watch it all the time like once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie . Homeward Bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things . Parts of the movie are sad though ( such as when Sassy , the cat , falls down the waterfall , and when Shadow falls in the hole at the end . ) I have seen the second Homeward Bound but I got ta say its not as good as the first . Shadow is the smart one , Sassy is , well , Sassy , and Chance is the funny idiot . I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies , or talking animals . This is one of my top ten favorite movies !
1 i really liked the film.at ending i was in tears.this film is incredible.go watch the movie . you will enjoy it.i could have given it ranking more than 10.i liked the teasing between chance and sassy.i like the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was perfect.<br /><br />its sequel is good but not good as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it.not only this film attracts children but also adults.my whole family enjoyed this film . Chance was full of humor.sassy is an intelligent cat.<br /><br />again i say THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH.the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie.this movie is a classic .
1 Hey guys , < br /><br />i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i ca n't find them anywhere in my local area . ( I am Australian ) . Could You please help me and tell me where i can buy it from . In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages . It was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager . It is a great movie for the whole family . My entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it . I love this movie and i ca nt wait till i can buy it again on DVD.<br /><br />Sally
1 This is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they 're thoughts are . I do n't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit . It also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities . Put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out . For once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice - over for the first has been removed . Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder , proving that , after all , animals are more interesting than people
1 This is one of the greatest child - pet movies ever created . I cry every time I see Shadow yelling " Wait , wait for me Peter ! " as the family car is pulling away . This is a must see if you love animals ! Best Movie Ever ! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid . Like when Sassy says to Chance ; " Cat 's Rule and dogs drool ! " Lines like this I could do without , but when I was six I bet I loved that line . The storyline may seem hooky to some , but I like it . Shadow as the older dog who 's preparing Chance to take over for him when he 's gone is really moving when you think about it . It reminded me of my childhood dog . I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in " Homeward Bound . "
1 Great voices , lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie . The addition of " character " to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning , particularly the relationship between the older fellow , Shadow , and the young hellraiser , Chance . The earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive , which is done perfectly here . Sally Field is lovable in anything , but really shines in this film as the proud feline , Sassy . Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life , and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent . There 's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery . Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids . Hats off to Disney .
1 This is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home . Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow , young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat Sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family . Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey ( 1993 ) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham . It 's a remake of a 1963 film . This movie got a sequel three years later . Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to do the voice - over for Chance . Fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role . Sally Field does great voice work as Sassy . Don Ameche is fantastic as Shadow . This was this veteran actor 's second last movie . Also the visible actors are great . Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford - Seaver . Robert Hays is Bob Seaver . Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford . Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford . Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver . Jean Smart portrays Kate . It 's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness . We see Sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner . The bear scene is exiting and funny . Chance has no chance with that big , hungry bear . And his meeting with the porcupine looks painful . This is some great fun for the whole family .
1 This is one of my favorite family movies . Loved it when I was little and it still holds up with me now that I 'm older . I still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times . I never have much cared for animals talking , or at least UN - animated ones but this one I 'll stand up for . It 's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.<br /><br />There are n't any other live animal movies that I can think of at the moment that I even could compare with , let alone like as much as this one . I might be giving too much praise to this movie but I do n't think show . I really holds that great message that " Home is where the heart is . " Or at least that 's the message I gained from it . Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night .
1 This is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy . It 's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals do n't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own . The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name . Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound . Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things . Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time . There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it is n't cheesy at all . It 's the best talking animal movie that I 've seen so far . It 's a really good movie for families .
1 First of all , I loved Bruce Broughton 's music score , very lyrical , and this alone added to the film 's charm . The best aspect of the movie were the three animals , superlatively voiced by Michael J.Fox , Sally Field and the late Don Ameche . Whereas Fox has the funniest lines , Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason ) , and Field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling Chance off . The humans were n't as engaging , and sometimes the film dragged , but that is my only complaint . This is one beautiful - looking film , with beautiful close up shots of Canada , I believe . Although the film itself is quite long , there is never a seriously dull moment , and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well - written script . All in all , a charming and perhaps underrated film , with a 9/10 from me . Bethany Cox .
1 SPOILERS ALERT < br /><br />Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it 's the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp . The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel , and is a reason why it 's not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone.<br /><br />The basic story : Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children , gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months . The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong , and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are , though the young and happy - go - lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical ( due in part to his voice - over explaining his being abandoned as a pup , picked up to an animal shelter , and being bought by the family ) , though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.<br /><br />The three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness ( fantastic wilderness settings by the way ) , driven on by Shadow 's instincts of direction . They meet several perils along the way , hoping to make it home , while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance . There are funny moments all the way through , great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines ( see - memorable quotes ) , and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling , punctuated by moments of sadness ( such as when Sassy 's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall , leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).<br /><br />Somehow though , I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take . Somehow , it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.<br /><br />The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg , finds it hard to get out and gives up , exhausted , followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out , telling him how important he is to him and how he 's pushed them this far so he should n't throw it all away so easily . < br /><br />The way that this scene ( brilliantly done ) is n't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home , but Shadow is nowhere to be seen . Then just as all seems lost , he slowly appears , and is reunited with the family . Chance 's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey , and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there , leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown , but also how the other two have as well . Hang on a second , I think I 'm going to cry ... <br /><br />Anyway , I have n't read Sheila Burnford 's book , so I do n't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie . But this is a film that all the family can watch , and while the tots will love the talking animals , older viewers will understand the plot line better ( as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it ) . This film is a masterpiece in cinema , and I suggest that if you have n't seen it you go out and get it!<br /><br />And please avoid the sequel ( see my review for Homeward Bound II ! )
1 I have n't seen the original " Incredible Journey " since I was a child , so I ca n't really compare the two versions . This version tells the story of three animals , two dogs and a cat , whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in San Francisco . The pets , believing that they have been abandoned , escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness.<br /><br />This story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon , but both versions are in fact live - action films made using real animals . One major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices , giving each its own distinct personality , something that was not done in the original film . ( A similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children 's films such as " Racing Stripes " ) . Some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device , but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it . The animals were voiced by big - name stars , Don Ameche , Michael J. Fox and Sally Fields.<br /><br />Both dogs are male , and their relationship parallels that between many humans in " buddy - buddy " movies . Shadow , a golden retriever , is the wise , experienced older dog ; Chance the younger one is brash , cocky and impulsive . To British eyes Chance looks like a boxer , but is actually an American Bulldog , which is apparently a different breed to its British cousin . Sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality . She is very proud of her status as a cat , which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog . ( " Cats rule , dogs drool!").<br /><br />From an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults ; it can be sentimental , some of the incidents ( such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river ) are quite incredible , and the human characters are all completely forgettable . This , however , is a film which is mainly aimed at children , and I suspect they will enjoy it immensely . Certainly , any animal - loving child will do so . ( Comments by some professional critics such as James Berardinelli , who complained that the animals ' voices lessened the film 's " grandeur " , only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children 's movies . I doubt if many playground conversations about " Homeward Bound " concentrated on its supposed grandeur).<br /><br />One thing adults will appreciate is the photography of California 's Sierra Nevada mountains . They may also appreciate the film 's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears , mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness . This is a very enjoyable family film . 7/10
1 I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re - sight all of the dialogue . And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh . I think it 's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film . However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it is n't the masterpiece i once thought it was . But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow . And and bearing in mind it is a children 's film , that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10 .
1 This movie is a true masterpiece , it really is . It 's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick , full of fun , laughter , heartbreak , and with a little drama to keep you on your toes . < br /><br />A true family film , Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets , who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners , following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way . One of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good . Shadow is a wonderful character , old , wise and brave , and watching him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment . Chance - who would n't love a dog like Chance ? He 's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen . And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper ; ' Here kitty kitty kitty ... not on your life , chubby . ' < br /><br />There were also lots of well made emotional scenes , such as Sassy going over the waterfall ( I was truly scared for her ) , Shadow falling in the ditch ( almost in tears ) and then the fantastic ending , when all three pets return home ... including good old Shadow ! < br /><br />A favourite for all time - anyone who does n't like this film must just not like animals . Rent it or buy it now , and it 'll leave you with happy memories that 'll last a lifetime .
1 I am a fan of animal movies . If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over . Homeward Bound did just this . They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it . It was a complete success . It is very much an archetypal movie . You have the obi - wan of the group(shadow ) who is wise and logical , you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance , and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised . These three personalities bounce off of each other very well . I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters , and they did not overdue it . Most people say that it can not be good because it is too much of a kids film . What they are forgetting , however , is that it is supposed to be a kids film , and this still does not take away from the acual movie . This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie . It is a Disney movie without the cartoons , an air bud movie with a better plot . I would , without a doubt , advise you to watch it .
1 Have you ever , or do you have , a pet who 's been with you through thick and thin , who you 'd be lost without , and who you love no matter what ? Betcha never thought they feel the same way about you!<br /><br />Wonderful , wonderful family film . If you have a soft spot for animals , this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age . I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a little kid , and I find that now , at age sixteen , I love it as much as I did then . I could never decide on a favorite character then , and I still do n't think I can ! I love all three of the animals . The dialogue seems very real and comfortable , like a loving , but feuding family . I do love Chance , and how at the end he says that he has a family at last . Cheesy , yes , but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film , and it fulfills that role perfectly . Sassy has just the perfect dose of " sassiness " and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model to the young , adventurous Chance.<br /><br />The animals way outshine the humans , but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them ( ie . rescuing Molly , and the end ) . Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion , and an accompanying heart - swelling feeling . I give this 9/10 . To be compared to ( and even rated better than ) Cats and Dogs and Babe .
1 i love this TV series so much . it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful . i ca nt believe that they cut it off TV , and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not , apparently they survive , but I 'm not sure . Cybersix was by far the BEST TV show ever . i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so I 'm really glad i got to watch it . I LUVED IT SO MUCH <3 < br /><br />its about a women by the name of cybersix , she is not human . She goes by adrian sieldman , a man teacher at a highschool . Now cybersix is actually a women , she is just disguised as a man in the day . By night cybersix patrols the city.<br /><br />A guy by the name of Von reichter is the one who created cybersix , and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her.<br /><br />IF u have never watched it before u should totally download it . It was the best TV show in the world . Why did they cut it off ? ? ? ? some people have issues . but I 'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes .
1 Giallo fans , seek out this rare film . It is well written , and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films . I do n't want to give anything away , so I wo nt even say anything about the plot . The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere , and you do n't know what to expect or who to suspect . Recommended ! The only place I 've seen to get this film in english is from European Trash Cinema , for $ 15 .
1 This little seen movie is a languid and laid - back giallo . It veers away from some of the cliché 's of the genre and adopts a looser approach . It 's about a woman searching for her missing lover ; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason . Her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals . In true giallo style , murder is never far away.<br /><br />The cast is really rather good . We have Aldofo Celi ( Thunderball ) , Alida Valli ( Suspiria ) , Horst Frank ( Cat o ' Nine Tails ) and a very young Sybil Danning ( 80 's scream queen ) . The lead actress is Rosemary Dexter , and while I am not familiar with her , she does a good job in leading the picture.<br /><br />One of the defining features of Eye in the Labyrinth is its music . Atypically for a giallo it features a jazz - rock fusion soundtrack . This score , composed by Roberto Nicolosi , is reminiscent of Miles Davis , especially his work on In A Silent Way . It 's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli . The fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny , sea - front scenery that the film is mostly made up of.<br /><br />This is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set - pieces . Well , this film falls a little short in this regard . It 's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between . The opening dream - murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence . But this really is n't a particularly violent film . Still , I do n't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre . The mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters ( the idiot boy Saro and THAT unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent ? ) and moments of the bizarre to satisfy ; while the sleaze - factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout.<br /><br />Eye in the Labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an Agatha Christie mystery , as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa , all under suspicion of murder ; we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the ( highly unsympathetic ) murder victim . While this is n't a grade - A example of the genre , it 's certainly an appealingly different one , as it does n't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub - genre . For giallo enthusiasts I give this a thumbs up and hope one day it 's given a nice DVD transfer . It certainly deserves the treatment .
1 Eye in the Labyrinth is not your average Giallo ... and to be honest , I 'm not really sure that it really is a Giallo ; but Giallo or not , despite some problems , this is certainly a very interesting little film . I 'm hesitant to call it a Giallo because the film does n't feature most of the things that make these films what they are ; but many genre entries break the mould , and this would seem to be one of them . The film does n't feature any brutal murders as many Giallo 's do , but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration . The plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by Julie , his patient who , for some reason , she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her . We then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people , but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before Julie 's arrival ... <br /><br />The film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth . This never really comes off , and I preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point ( if any ) the film is trying to make . Eye in the Labyrinth is directed by Mario Caiano , the director behind the excellent Night of the Doomed some years earlier . He does n't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one ; but the surreal aspects of the story come off well , and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring . The film stars Rosemary Dexter , who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance . Most of the rest of the cast are n't really worth mentioning , with the exceptions of Adolfo Celi , who is good as the villain of the piece and Alida Valli , whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks . The film does explain itself at the end ; which is lucky as I 'm sure I 'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then ! Overall , this may not be classic stuff ; but its good enough and worth seeing .
1 How nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together . Josie Bissett and Rob Estes ( who are married in real life ) play a couple who marry in Las Vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households ( each has two boys and two girls)into a cohesive family unit . What transpires when the group , which includes four teenagers , two preteens and two younger children , makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim . The fights between the kids ( and one little love affair between two of them ) make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along . More interesting than the Brady Bunch , what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours . Recommended as a feel good movie for all ages .
1 Rob Estes , Josie Bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them.<br /><br />Basically , Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a Vegas vacation . They each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid - like not - so - fodder . They , Rob and Josie , move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other 's house.<br /><br />Rob builds furniture , I think , which is close enough to Frank Lambert 's ( Patrick Duffy ) construction job on the much similar Step by Step to warrant eternal mockage.<br /><br />Josie is some sort of cookie - making queen , though it does n't look like she makes any of the cookies . Not close enough to Carol Foster 's ( Suzanne Somers)hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage , but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage.<br /><br />Unlike Step by Step , they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another 's last names , or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together.<br /><br />Anyhow , there are eight kids ; Moira , Sandy , Jeff , Lily , Daisy , Nathan , Andrew L. and Andrew B. I , personally , think they should 've just called the younger Andrew ' Andy'.<br /><br />There 's a lot of product placement , particularly for Soup at Hand ( Which is disgusting ) and Listerine Pocket Packs . There are also some stupid , senseless moments . It 's also not a great film to promote happy families.<br /><br />But , hey ! Rob Estes ! This concludes my review of ' Step By Step ... on some really bad drugs . ' Watch it for Rob Estes and his pretty!eyes . There are some great pretty!eyes shots .
1 I thought the movie " I Do They Do n't " was fantastic . In the past I 've watched Rob Estes on " Suddenly Susan " & " Melrose Place " and also Josie Bissett on " Melrose Place " and loved seeing them together again in " I Do They Do n't " . They have great chemistry together ( I guess being married in real life helps that ! ) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball . Of course they stumble , but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about . So many people have been talking about this movie - all good ! - and the movie left us wanting more . This would make a great series - appealing to many ages ! - it would be so nice to see a real life , down to earth , family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called " Reality TV " that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days . Someone tell the people at ABC Family they have the start of a new series here !
1 most of the bad reviews on this website blame " Hood of the Living Dead " for one ( or more ) of the following reasons : 1 ) it is a low - budget movie with virtually no acting ; 2 ) it was so bad it made me laugh 3 ) it is something I could do myself . I wo n't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low - budget and independent stuff or not . I must say , however , that I still fail to understand people renting such a movie as " Hood of the Living Dead " and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with Lindsay Lohan or Matthew Mc Conaughey . As for the second point , I really do n't see what 's so wrong with laughing . I personally like to laugh , and love movies that make me to , be they comedies or horror flicks . When in " Hammerhead " I saw this girl stepping into a PUDDLE and the shark - man came out of it to eat her , I just cracked up . And I was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun . Honestly , laughing just makes me feel good , while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing . If you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie , " Hood of the Living Dead " and low - budget flicks are definitely not for you . But please do n't come and tell us that you find them laughable . We already know it . This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place . However , it is the third point that leaves totally baffled . Just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see " Blair Witch Project " , which is a way more rudimentary , boring , plot - less and bad - acted movie than " Hood of the Living Dead " ( and takes itself way too seriously too ) . Moreover , half a million people go on YouTube every day to see the short films of " Lonelygirl15 " , which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend , a room and a webcam could do ! Not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there . Why do n't people blame those clips for bad acting and non - existing plot ? I think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone , with affordable technology and a bunch of friends , can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests . And I feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad ( yet refreshing ) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone . Leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b - movies , and you 'll see that " Hood of the Living Dead " can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers ! If you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home - made horror movies , I recommend " Zombiez " , " The Ghosts of Edendale " , " The Killer Eye " , " Monster Man " , " Do n't Look in the Basement " , " The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made " , " Redneck Zombies " , " Jesus Christ Vampyre - Slayer " and " Habit " .
1 The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together comprise the two best episodes of the ' new ' Doctor Who 's second season . Having said that , it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) to an outer space setting , with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the Beast 666 . These episodes cement the emotional ties between Rose and the Doctor , whilst also highlighting Rose 's increasing self - confidence , establishing her as a not - quite - equal - yet - but - getting - there partner with our beloved Time Lord . Also of note is Matt Jones elegant screenplay , which decreases the occasional over - reliance on one - liners for the Doctor , and the performances of the entire cast , most notably the excellent Shaun Parkes as acting Captain Zachary Cross Flane .
1 This is , without a shadow of a doubt , one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of Doctor Who . This is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question . Riddled with spine - chilling moments , this is an episode no " Who " fan can afford to miss.<br /><br />Starting from when the pit was opened after the events in " The Impossible Planet " , the Doctor and Ida are trapped and are running out of air . With no other alternatives , they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit , an event which surpasses even The Doctor 's expectations . Whilst there , the Doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice ... <br /><br />Meanwhile , Rose and the other members of the Planet try to find a way to fend off the Ood , whose minds have been poisoned by the Beast . Also , is Toby Zed truly cured of his possession by the Beast ?
1 This was an excellent 2-part episode , although I had never been seen the older ones , I never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal , extra terrestial of course but not paranormal.<br /><br />This episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans , in a futuristic time , would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible.<br /><br />Being that it 's a family film I am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith , especially if its also going to entertain American audiences . But who care about what Yanks say , we rock ! Doctor Who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 , first being so harmless to scary , from fun to serious , from light to darkness . I hope many old fans will one day soon say " The old Doctor Who has returned".<br /><br />10 out of 10
1 I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter , The Impossible Planet , and was slightly worried that the second part would n't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 Who series . But thankfully my fears were unfounded as I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one . Anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the Ood , whom have become the Devil 's pawn . There is also a bit of philosophizing on the Doctor 's part in the episode that I quite enjoyed . Needless to say it was a good solid Doctor Who story . Might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though.<br /><br />My Grade : B+
1 Anyone find it interesting that the Ood look strangely similar to the ' Great Cthulhu ' of H P Lovecraft vintage ? hmmm ? < br /><br />Great pair of episodes ( not referring to Billie Piper as most seem to do ! ) in The impossible Planet and The Satan Pit.<br /><br />Also the link to ' Legion ' I think also used in Who before and also referring to Satan in various novels post Exorcist era ... <br /><br />Great suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements . The new team for these ' who 's are working great magic for TV.<br /><br />This certainly creates new fears and ' hide behind the sofa ' feelings not seen for many , many years in this continuation of a superb BBC series ( pity it is confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper is quitting - perhaps not permanently - after end of series 2 ) : O ( ( (
1 I love the Satan Pit ! ! ! David Tennant is such a great actor and so is Billie Piper ! ! ! Who else loves Will Thorp to pieces ? ? ? He is so cute , is n't he ? I hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to " go to hell " , as Rose so bluntly put it . Mind you , he was quite funny when he said , " Rose , do us a favour , will you ? Shut up ! " . Mr Jefferson was so brave , was n't he ? Dying to save the others . I felt really sorry for Toby ( Will Thorp ) when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared . I was like " Oh my god if I was Rose I 'd be so scared for him " . And when she hugged him I was like " grrrrrr , he 's mine ! hands off ! " but I thought that was really sweet . And the doctor .... well , I thought he was gon na say to Ida " tell Rose I love her " but he did n't . Oh well .
1 This gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated . It 's pure delight and fun ! Gratuitous servings of blood , insanity and black humor , which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre . A full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot . Only for the connoisseurs .
1 After witnessing his wife ( Linda Hoffman ) engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy , the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr. Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients.<br /><br />This delightful semi - original and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties . Although The Dentist ' is intended to be a cheesy , fun little film , Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense . Despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters , and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days , the movie is intriguing , generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest , even during the more ludicrous of moments . The Dentist ' suffers , on occasion , from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel , there are only sporadic uninteresting moments , and in general the movie follows itself nicely.<br /><br />Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic , deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone . The way Bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines , especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex ( particularly fellatio ) , is something short of marvellous . While many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous , Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable . Had The Dentist ' not been intended to be a fun , almost comical , horror movie , Bernsen 's performance would probably have been much more powerful . Sadly , the rest of the cast ( including a pre - fame Mark Ruffalo ) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this , stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.<br /><br />The Dentist ' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable , particularly ( I would presume ) for fans of cheesy horror . Those who became annoyed at the number of Scream ' ( 1996 ) clones from the late Nineties may very well find this a refreshing change , as I did . A seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make The Dentist ' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990 's . On top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and ( on the whole ) realistic scenes of dental torture , which should keep most gorehounds happy . Far from perfect but far from bad as well , The Dentist ' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once . My rating for The Dentist '  6.5/10 .
1 I remember this movie in particular when I was a teenager , my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid . Of course being the blood thirsty gal that I am , I had to go out and find this movie . Now I do n't know how to put this without loosing credibility , so I 'm just going to say it , I actually had fun watching this movie ! I know that it 's stupid , not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome , but that 's what I was looking for and The Dentist delivers in the scares , blood , sex , and crazy psychopaths . Sometimes I just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by.<br /><br />Dr . Alan Feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness . On the day of his wedding anniversary , he spies his wife Brooke having sex with their filthy pool man , Matt . At his dental practice , Feinstone 's first patient of the day is young Jody Saunders , there for his very first dental appointment . Feinstone begins to clean Jody 's teeth . Everything goes smoothly at first , until he imagines that Jody 's teeth are brown and rotten . His dental pick slips , stabbing Jody in the gums . Jody 's mother picks up her crying , bleeding child and leaves angrily . Feinstone sees his second patient , beauty queen April Reign . Alone with April , Feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars . As she drifts off into unconsciousness , Feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife . He begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair , then begins to choke her . April starts to cough and half - wakes up from the gas . Feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re - buttons April 's blouse . Feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home . Later that night , Brooke meets Feinstone at his practice . He reveals his new Italian opera - themed patient room . He encourages Brooke to try out the room 's dental chair . When she does , Feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide . With operatic music blaring in the background , he begins to pull out Brooke 's teeth . Feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness.<br /><br />Honestly , as silly as this movie sounds , I did have a lot of fun watching The Dentist . The best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty IRS agent a lesson in hygiene that I 'm sure he 'll never forget . Man , I do n't think I 've brushed my teeth so much after I watched The Dentist . Yeah , I am going to warn you , this movie is in no way for the faint of heart , it 's very bloody . There 's stabbing , gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn . Yet somehow I just enjoyed this movie , if I ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans , I slip it in my DVD player , and that 's the " tooth " LOL ! I am so funny ! Um , yeah , I try , give me a little credit.<br /><br />7/10
1 Director Brian Yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre , creating masterpieces such as " Return of the Living Dead 3 " or " Bride of Re - Animator " , but at the same time he has done awful movies such as " Faust : Love for the Damned " or the mediocre " Progeny " . He is obviously better in the seat of Producer where his work producing Stuart Gordon 's films has been superb.<br /><br />"The Dentist " , is one of his lesser works as director , but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience . It tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone ( played superbly by Corbin Bernsen ) , a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife ( Linda Hoffman)has an affair with the pool boy . This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so " filthy".<br /><br />The premise is very well handled by Yuzna , as he takes us on a ride following Feinstone 's day of revenge . What makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim 's perspective , we follow Feinstone because he is the main character . We witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day . Yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie.<br /><br />Most of the success of the premise is in Bernsen 's performance as Feinstone . He can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time , and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film . The rest of the cast is not as good , and I think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should . A notable exception is Ken Foree , as the detective trying to catch Feinstone . While his part is quite small , he makes a great job with it.<br /><br />With a dentist as killer , gory scenes are expected , and Brian Yuzna delivers great SFX in the correct amount . It 's good to see that he does not go over - the - top with it as he usually do , and I dare to say that this is a highlight of the film . It has the exact amount of gore that is expected , nothing less and nothing more . Yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great.<br /><br />While this is not among Yuzna 's most well - known films , I would say that it is one of his best . Sure , it is not classic material as his masterpieces , but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring . It is a low - budget simple film , but for what it is , I think it rocked . 7/10
1 Doctor Feinstone is a dentist . He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool . Suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant - he realises that behind everything clean , there is decay . He starts to torture his patients ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist - he is completely believable . There is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque . Highly recommended."The Dentist 2 " is also worth checking out !
1 this is an entertaining movie . actually might make you uncomfortable since it is n't some undead psychopath or sociopath , its your everyday doctor . how scary is that . got some good actors and actresses in this movie , though some where unappreciated like Virginya Keehne as Sarah . Ken Foree who you might recognize from rob zombie 's devils rejects and Halloween(2007 ) co - stars as our detective on schizoid Dr. Alan Feinstone's(Corbin Benson)trail . Short little summary is this : Dr. Alan Feinstone , a guy who has a sexy wife , nice house , and is a great dentist everyone loves . Until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner . Then he starts having hallucinations that his patients ' teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller . But before that , nice guy .
1 This would have been so much fun to see in a theater , back in 1996 . There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies.<br /><br />"The Dentist " is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters . Maybe the ADA launched a campaign against it , since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for " The Marathon Man " ( which only has one scene comparable to the many in " The Dentist").<br /><br />It 's amazing to note that according to the trivia page , the movie was shot in 21 days . Of course , post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for " The Dentist " is picture perfect . The quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the Dentist " takes care " of his wife there 's only two quick cuts showing what is happening . The rest is left to our very fertile imaginations ! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically " off " characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist.<br /><br />For me the pacing of the movie was just right . The film makers reveal the wife 's naughtiness in just the right way . All of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office . There 's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist 's arrival . Meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown ! Unlike so many movies of this genre , the script is very very tight . All the victims fall into the dentist 's trap in very calculated ways . Two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end.<br /><br />Definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental - phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests .
1 Not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have . Those in the profession have some genuinely intimidating looking instruments . Give writers Dennis Paoli , Stuart Gordon , and Charles Finch for deriving maximum make - you- squirm - in - your - seat shock value from their premise.<br /><br />Corbin Bernsen , in a nicely nuanced performance , is Alan Feinstone , dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on . An unbalanced obsessive - compulsive , he starts dwelling on thoughts of decay , even imagining it where there is n't any , and also equating decay with corruption of society in general . Having witnessed his unfaithful wife Brooke ( Linda Hoffman ) getting it on with their pool boy , he determines to punish her . At the same time , he 's under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S. agent ( Earl Boen , best known as Dr. Silberman from the " Terminator " franchise ) to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about Feinstone 's financial affairs . Feinstone starts to perceive everybody around him as decayed in one way or another , and he goes on a murder spree as police detective Gibbs ( the always welcome Ken Foree ) picks up his trail.<br /><br />Director Brian Yuzna clearly has great fun with the script . It allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience . The script gives the Feinstone character some fine lines of dialog and is overall quite sly and amusing , with large doses of pitch - black humor ( such as Feinstone ordering a victim to " get their tongue out of the way ! " ) . Brooke and the I.R.S. agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes . The makeup effects are for the most part quite good . And the film does a fine job of maintaining its forward momentum , as Feinstone , with his relentless drive for perfection , switches from respected professional to unhinged killer in record time.<br /><br />Foree , always cool and fun to watch , is rather wasted in a standard - issue detective role , but there 's some enjoyment in watching Boen play his slimeball part to the hilt . Hoffman and Christa Sauls provide very appealing eye candy . And a pre - fame Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role . But this is all very much Bernsen 's show as he sinks his teeth ( pardon me for using that expression ) into his plum leading part with total conviction.<br /><br />"The Dentist " ranks as one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990's.<br /><br />8/10
1 I 'm surprised no - one has thought of doing a movie like this before . Horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme . And nobody ( except for Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors ) likes going to the dentist . Tooth torture has been done before ( see The Marathan Man for example ) , but this brings the terror into suburbia.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a dentist , Dr. Alan Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) , who descends into madness . Now our dear doctor was n't playing with a full deck to begin with , but driven by jealousy and an obsessive - compulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him . The doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in Micheal Douglas 's character in Falling Down , but with a horror edge.<br /><br />Written and directed by horror stalwarts Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna , its witty and has a great flow . Also featured playing a cop , is the ever welcome Ken Foree.<br /><br />Now I believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from Corbin Bernsen . Having really only seen him in LA Law before , I was blown away by his acting.<br /><br />The sequel The Dentist 2 is also worth watching , but slightly under par compared to the original.<br /><br />TTKK 's Bottomline - A fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe , capped ( pun intended ) by a great performance from Bernsen
1 The Dentist is a really good thriller . And pretty disturbing . I think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters , vampires or zombies . That 's exactly why this movie is so scary . During this film , you 'll probably think about your own dentist a few times . Whether he 's capable of doing such things ... You better pray his wife does n't cheat on him . That 's what the story is all about . A respected dentist in LA snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool - boy . ( That must be the greatest profession in the world , by the way . Poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work ) From then on our dentist , Dr. Feinstone , can only thing about taking revenge . He ca n't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt . Things are n't made easier for our dentist when he 's chased by an annoying tax - controller , a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his . At one point , Dr. Feinstone ca n't take it anymore . Now he 's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him .. The dentist is written and directed by Brian Yuzna and co - written by Stuart Gordon . You can take that as a recommendation to itself . These 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies ( and personal favorites of mine ) like Re - Animator , From Beyond and Society . With the Dentist , they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller . This film came right on time actually . The decade had n't brought us many great horror films so far . I 'm not at all saying this IS a masterpiece , but it 's a nice change . Corbin Bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene . I remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor , but he can sure handle a psychotic character . The rest of the cast does good work too . The woman who plays Feinstone 's wife is really attractive . Also , it was great to see Ken Foree acting again . The actor from my all time favorite movie Dawn of the Dead plays the cop in this film . Yuzna casted him in From Beyond too , 15 years ago and I thank him for that . I do n't recommend this movie to everyone ( if you have a weak stomach , I 'll advise you to skip it ) but if you do watch it , you 'll enjoy it very much . You 'll be disgusted ... but that 's an extra reason , I think . It 's been a while since I was really freaked out by watching a film . It 's a great topic to handle in the genre and Yuzna does it in a great way . Too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel . My humble opinion on the Dentist ... 8/10
1 Before we begin , I have a fear of dentists . This movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe . That is what I love about this film . The movie is kind of boring . For that , I take 3 stars off!<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him . Soon , he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients , killing co - workers , and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with.<br /><br />*End Spoiler * < br /><br />The movie is very bloody and gory . I would recommend it if you are into gore.<br /><br />I give this film 7 stars out of 10 . Dr. Alan Feinstein Is Not Your Normal Everyday Dentist !
1 I love this movie . As a kid , this was one of the first movies I saw that made me flinch . Sure , it is mild now , but back in the day , it was awesome . Dentists are one thing so many people fear , so why not do a movie about a killer dentist ? It 's cheesy , it 's fun , sometimes it 's scary , but it is awesome . And I have always had a love for medical horror . And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly , no one could have done it better . And for a low budget horror film , the effects and such are quite good . And I also love the theme music , it goes well with the film . Ken Foree ( Dawn of the Dead ) is also in this one playing a nosy cop , and does a fine job . There is a fair amount of blood , and some really cool torture / death scenes . Check this one out !
1 The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary . It 's one of man 's primal fears . This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room . Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non - lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who I guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it 's not really working out . In a particularly gory scene we find so - so actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot , which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when you 're a killer dentist . It 's a typical Brian Yuzna situation , not well written but there 's gore . The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey , it 's a killer dentist movie , we 've all thought of it but they did it first .
1 I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger , and gradually getting less so , until getting jaded enough , as I 'm sure many other viewers have become , so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm . " The Dentist " turned that around.<br /><br />The setup seems simple : a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths , and perhaps bodies as well . A clever twist , though , is that the dentist is the film 's protagonist , so instead of being some one - dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation , his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable . The viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims , and instead of hoping for justice to come to him , I found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life.<br /><br />What really " makes " a horror movie is the violence . And " The Dentist " does it better than any other film I can think of . First off , the film has tons of tension , which is something that modern gore films tend to lack . In one scene ( ) , the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time . As he reaches into the child 's mouth , you hope that , for the dentist 's and the child 's sake , the encounter ends without injury . I wo n't spoil what happens . Second , when the gore does come , it hits all the worst , squirmy nerves . Once again , I wo n't give anything away.<br /><br />Of course , being a movie that you 've never heard of , it does have flaws . Most importantly , it 's exclusively for horror fans . Also , as another reviewer mentioned , by taking place over a span of just a few days , we do n't really get any background on the characters . And the tension drops a little bit during the very end . But really , the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is , and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven.<br /><br />It 's strange , after years of being accustomed to movie gore , to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood . " The Dentist " made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable , and for this it earns my full approval .
1 i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site , but i will defend this film.<br /><br />The Dentist is actually a really good film . The acting is n't always top notch , but the thrills are good and the story 's good . Plus you see Linda Hoffman 's boobies . Not that I 'm an expert in this field , but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense . Corbin makes a great creepy dentist . It does to dentists what Jaws does to sharks ... ish . It obviously had a fairly limited budget , but they did well with it what they could , and developed the characters well ( those that count).<br /><br />the end .
1 As if most people did n't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry , this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm . A successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man ( on their anniversary of all days ! ) and snaps big time into a furious breakdown . After shooting an attack dog 's head off , he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his " slut " of a wife . There are plenty of up - close shots of mouth - jabbing , tongue - cutting , and beauty queen fondling , as well as a marvelously deranged performance by Corbin Bernsen . The scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch . A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail . " The Dentist " is incredibly entertaining , fast - paced , and laughably gory at times . Check it out !
1 This is a gory mess and pretty convincing . Corbin Bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner . Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her , the little " tryst " with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile ! The last half hour of the movie is devoted to Bernson 's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virginya Keehne . An extremely talented performer , she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off . Nice legs , too !
1 The Dentist starts on the morning of Dr. Alan Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) & his wife Brooke 's ( Linda Hoffman ) wedding anniversary . On the surface Mr. & Mrs. Feinstone seem to have a nice life , a beautiful home in Los Angeles & he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong . Alan discovers that Brooke is having an affair with Matt ( Michael Stadvec ) the swimming pool cleaner , to add to his humiliation Alan then discovers that Matt is also having sex with Paula Roberts ( Lise Simms ) one of his next door neighbours & to top it all off he owes the IRS , who are breathing down his neck , a shed load of money . Alan starts to lose his mind , he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten , just like his patient 's teeth , & it 's up to him to fix it . That morning at work he begins to take his frustrations & anger out on his patients , first he injures a young boy named Jody ( Brian McLaughlin ) , he sexual assault 's a patient named April Reign ( Christa Sauls ) after he hallucinates that she is his wife & deliberately performs an unnecessary & painful procedure on another . Alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it & goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife & pool cleaner ... <br /><br />Directed by Brian Yuzna I thought The Dentist was a good film & tried something a bit different . The script by Dennis Paoli , Stuart Gordon & Charles Finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as I was expecting the latter , it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) with a high body count & a wise cracking dentist villain but what The Dentist actually turned out to be is very different . The Dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness & it does a fine job although having said that I 'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions . It moves along at a nice pace , has a nice narrative in which I liked the constant connection Alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients & the decay he sees in the world around him & is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes . It goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you 'll never go again ! I liked the ending too where the tables are turned , I 'll say no more ... <br /><br />Director Yuzna does his usual fine job here , in fact I do n't think I 've seen a Yuzna film that I did n't enjoy to some extent , he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people 's teeth out , sexually molesting them , performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist 's drill . There are some other gore scenes as well , a dead dog , someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues . Yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget , he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & I liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle.<br /><br />Technically The Dentist is fine , decent cinematography , music & production values although some of the special make - up effects look a little unconvincing . The acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with Corbin putting in a good crackpot performance . The ever cool & genre favourite Ken Foree turns up as Detective Gibbs one of Los Angeles finest.<br /><br />The Dentist did n't turn out like I had expected & all the better for it , if your a horror fan & perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out . I liked it & think it 's definitely worth a watch .
1 First it was Jack The Ripper , now it is Alan Feinstone . The crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways . Quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical . Especially from Corbin Bernson . In some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe .
1 This movie is very great ! The acting is fine , with excellent casting of Corbin Bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients . In the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman , and then he goes crazy . He also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman , beside the patients he tortures . The most special effects are also beautiful , although some are really fake ( like a drilled - out tongue , that has laid for 1 night outside , and is still red in the morning ) . But the torture scenes are absolutely well - done . Though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow ; between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts . But for the real horror / thriller - fan this is a must - watch !
1 The Dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it 's psycho . We had mad police officers , ambulance men , secretery 's and that was just for starters . The Dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman 's nightmare.<br /><br />The plot is twisted . Super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives perfect life in his great " white house " , he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist . Dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty IRS guy ( Terminator 's Earl Boen ) , dirty pool cleaner " cleaning " his wife and suddenly everyone 's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter . He goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way . And you do n't want to come to his path.<br /><br />Crew were professional . Producer / director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like Re - Animator and From Beyond . He directed the sequel to Re - Animator and his first movie Society was nice spinoff from John Carpenter 's They Live . Film 's producer Pierre David is known from movies like Scanners . Cast was great . Corbin Bernsen really suprised me . I knew him from LA Law and Major League , but I could newer dream him as a psycho dentist . He was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person . Linda Hoffman was beutiful and dumb as Feinstones wife . Micahel Stadvec did not have much line 's , but after I saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood I knew my future profession . Ken Foree ( Dawn of the Dead , From Beyond ) was nice sight as cop on the case . Virginya Keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to Feinstone.<br /><br />Final warning : If you 're like me and have problem with dentist 's then maybe you should skip this one . But if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings .
1 This movie was very enjoyable , though you 'll only like it if : - you hate going to the dentist but are n't afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk - you love horror movies < br /><br />I particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character . The fact that he 's totally obsessed by cleanliness ( especially in the mouth ) and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud - covered pool - man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard.<br /><br />Liked it . I give it an 8 .
1 Corbin Bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone , a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who 's obsessed with perfection . When he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the IRS start hounding him about tax problems , Feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend . Director Brian Yuzna , working from a suitably dark , witty and demented script by Stuart Gordon , Dennis Paoli , and Charles Finch , exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well - manicured surface of respectable affluent rich America with deliciously malicious glee . Moreover , Yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor . Bernsen positively shines as Dr. Feinstone ; he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that 's right beneath Feinstone 's deceptively calm and assured veneer . The supporting cast are likewise excellent : Linda Hoffman as Feinstone 's bitchy , unfaithful wife Brooke , Earl Boen as smarmy , meddlesome IRS agent Marvin Goldblum , Molly Hagan as feisty assistant Jessica , Patty Toy as perky assistant Karen , Jan Hoag as jolly office manager Candy , Virginya Keehne as sweet , gawky teenager Sarah , Ken Foree as thorough , no - nonsense Detective Gibbs , Tony Noakes as Gibbs ' equally shrewd partner Detective Sunshine , Michael Stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner Matt , and Mark Ruffalo as on the make sleazeball Steve Landers . The first - rate make - up f / x are every bit as gory , gross and upsetting as they ought to be . The polished cinematography by Levie Isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom - in close - ups . Alan Howarth 's spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh - crawling spot . An enjoyably warped treat .
1 As Dr. Alan Feinstone , Corbin Bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in " The Dentist".<br /><br />With his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear , the IRS hounding him , and a very suspicious acting wife ; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day.<br /><br />When the Doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy , it sets off a string of events that lead to torture , murder , ant total mayhem ! " The Dentist " is a solid film ! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time . Even though he is completely out of his gourd , the audience will still feel sympathy towards him . That my friends ..... is damn good acting.<br /><br />A nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film . Excellent direction , good killings and gore , and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !
1 When I saw the Dentist , I thought it was very cool . But this movie is not for everyone , especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes . That 's why it has it 's R18 rating . It 's about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone , who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman . It 's best to go to your dentist " before " you watch this . But if you do n't like going to the dentist already , then it 's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life . the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I 've ever seen . Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist ( Spoiler ) pull out all his cheating wife 's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic ? Overall awesome flick , but not for everyone .
1 Brian Yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore - fests , but the truth is that his films actually are n't bad at all . The Re - Animator sequels are n't as great as the original , but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned . Return of the Living Dead 3 is the best of the series ; and Society is n't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece . This thriller certainly is n't a masterpiece ; but it shows Yuzna 's eye for horror excellently , and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging . I 'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry did n't turn up until 1996 , as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it 's running away from a tiger for the modern world . Dentistry does n't frighten me , but surprisingly ; I would appear to be in the minority . The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone . He has a nice house , a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want . However , his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife 's affair with the pool cleaner . And his life is n't the only one ; as it 's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger ... <br /><br />When it comes to scaring the audience , this movie really makes itself . However , credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme . The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I 'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes ! The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline , only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there 's more to the film than what we 're seeing . It is n't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this wo n't be winning any awards , the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot . The acting , while B - class , is actually quite impressive ; with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge . I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie . The Dawn of the Dead star does n't get enough work , and I really love seeing him in films . The rest of the cast does n't massively impress , but all do their jobs well enough . Overall , The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies . The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans , and I do n't hesitate to recommend this film .
1 Okay . This Movie is a Pure Pleasure . It has the Ever so Violent Horror Mixed with a Little Suspense and a Lot of Black Comedy . The Dentist Really Starts to loose His Mind and It 's Enjoyable to Watch him do so . This Movie is for Certain People , Though . Either you 'll Completely Love it or You Will Totally Hate It . A Good Movie to Rent and Watch When you do n't Got Anything else to do . Also Recommended : Psycho III
1 " Fear Of A Black Hat " is everything the ( much weaker ) " CB-4 " SHOULD have been . Rusty Cundieff 's satirical eye is ruthless , as he folds , spindles , and mutilates every aspect of hip - hop trends and culture . Does " FoaBH " resemble Spinal Tap ? Yes , a bit . Is it derivative of Spinal Tap ? No , not really . The aim is more focused , the satire is better focused , and to be honest , it 's funnier .
1 Rated R for Strong Language , Violent Content and Some Nudity . Quebec Rating:13 + Canadian Home Video Rating:14A < br /><br />Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest , most original comedies I have ever seen . Its basically a gangsta rap version of the film This Is Spinal Tap . Its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film . If you manage to find this film anywhere do n't hesitate to buy it even if you do n't like rap music . There are not too many comedy films that I give a perfect 10/10 to . The only ones I can think of at the moment are this film , Clerks , The World According To Garp , The 40 Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy . This film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture . The movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group N.W.H(N****z with hats).They are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta . Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedic film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene . Its a shame this film is not in the Top 250.<br /><br />Runtime:88min < br /><br />10/10
1 After a big tip of the hat to Spinal Tap , this movie is hilarious . Anyone who grew up watching MTV will love it and if you did n't , rent it anyway , the " My Peanuts " and " A Gangster 's life " videos are worth the three bucks alone .
1 I 'm too old to know ( or care ) exactly what the difference between rap and hip - hop is . And , being Canadian , it 's likely that I 've never actually seen MTV , but I 'm not certain.<br /><br />But I thought this film was very funny when I saw it , a bright little satire . Hip - hop culture is so pervasive these days that it 's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over . ( If only we could say the same about bagpipe music . ) I got most of the jokes ( at least I think I did ) . Sure , it 's derived from Spinal Tap , but there are lots of targets that could stand a Tap treatment . Just not the Carpenters , they 're sacred .
1 Okay , my title is kinda lame , and almost sells this flick short . I remember watching Siskel & Ebert in ' 94 talking about this movie , and then playing a clip or two . Not being a rap - conscious guy ( although I could identify Snoop Dogg , Vanilla Ice , and MC Hammer music ) , I was n't much interested when they started talking about the film . But then , S&E showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name ( using some " shady " logic and a bunch of " made up " facts ) , and then another scene where the band , and their rival band , both visit a school to promote getting involved ( and , of course , NWH comes up with some " info " about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee ) . So I filed it away that I should see this movie.<br /><br />A couple of years later , this thing shows up on HBO and I recorded it , only to laugh my butt off for hours . Yes , it has a " Spinal Tap " kind of rhythm to it ... even the documentarist takes essentially the same " tone " in setting up the clips , and the band follows a similar path ( what I now call the " Behind the Music " phenomenon - smalltime band has good chemistry , gets famous , too much money too fast , squabbling , drugs , some type of death , band breaks up , then reconciles , finishing with a hope for more albums in the future , and fade to black ) . The one thing that is true is that in Spinal Tap , you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past . But Tap drags at some points , and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes . Oh , this is his rant about the backstage food , this is spot where he wants the amp to go to " ELEVEN " , this is the spot where the guy makes the pint - sized stonehenge , etc ... <br /><br />Contrasting to FoaBH , which seems to have more " unexpected " humor . You can see some of it coming , but there is n't a big setup for every joke . Sometimes , the jokes just kinda flow . Cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked . Also , the direct references to Vanilla Ice , Hammer , and a bunch of other caricature - type rappers really worked well . This strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs , and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes . And the songs . Is " My Peanuts " better than " Big Bottom " ( from Spinal Tap ) ? I do n't know - but they 're both damn funny . Tone Def 's awful video during his " awakening " phase is so bizarre , yet so funny.<br /><br />I could go on awhile , but save your time and do n't waste it on CB4 . I watched the first half hour , and got bored . You do n't get bored on FoaBH . There are slightly less funny moments , but you can never tell when something good is about to happen . Perhaps my favorite scene is when Ice Cold and Tastey Taste ( name ripoffs if I 've ever heard any ) discover they 've been sharing the same girl .... at one point , you 've got those two pointing guns at each other , and the next thing you know , the manager , the photographer , the girl , and I think even Tone Def are in the room pointing guns at each other , switching targets back and forth . And , of course , someone does get shot.<br /><br />I did find it odd that NWH 's managers suffered similar fates to Spinal Tap 's drummers ( although none spontaneously combusted , I do n't think ) . There were enough similarities that I can not ignore the likelihood that Cundieff saw " Spinal Tap " prior to writing this film , although this is clearly much more the Spinal Tap of hip - hop . While some similarities exist , the humor is different , and the movie seems more like a real documentary ( maybe because we do n't recognize a single actor in this thing , even the guy who played " Lamar " from " Revenge of the Nerds " ) . All in all , this movie has , in my opinion , " street cred " . Kinda like NWH .
1 This is a really funny film , especially the second , third and fourth time you watch it . It 's a pretty short film , and i definitely recommend watching it more than once , you will ' get it ' more the second time.<br /><br />It 's like spinal tap but the rap version . It has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films , but it 's just a total p**s take and is n't a problem because of the irony it creates.<br /><br />Plenty of stand - out bits , one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates , and it WILL raise laughter.<br /><br />My personal favourite part is the ' guerrillas in the midst ' section . Great video , superb !
1 i 've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond . you 're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group N.W.A. which dates back to the beginning in 1988 , in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 , the band breaking up when Dr.dre left . which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and dr.dre in 1991 . this story was somewhat based on that.<br /><br />further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree , the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious . not to mention the " love song " tasty was hooking up . and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked , just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they 're managers getting shot every time too.<br /><br />people who did n't enjoy this movie probably did n't get it or were complete idiots , my opinion
1 I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white , educated , and urban . The showing I attended had a sprinkling of African - Americans , and it made the difference in audience - reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country . Basically , the white folks were AFRAID to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits --and there are many ! -- because they 'd be " laughting at Blacks " , while the Blacks also stayed pretty silent because many could n't laugh at themselves in front of the whites . < br /><br />I , on the other hand , being Asian ( and thus belonging to neither group ) , had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos / trappings / values / pseudo - philosophies . The cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed . The songs are too funny to be believed.<br /><br />This film is one of the best pseudo - documentaries to come along , including " A Mighty Wind "
1 My , Kasi Lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman . This film is a lost gem , a dead - on satire " mockumentary " of the early 90 's Hip Hop scene , when MC Hammer had just began to fade away into that good night . We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would - be riches and fame . And like Nickolas Nickleby , at the end , they finish their journey not far from where they started , but at least a little wiser and lot less naive . This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of , but it 's the kind of film you either love or hate , a lot like " Company Man " in this regard . I regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate New York : it 's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself .
1 I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is STILL funny . I do n't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90 's , but it helps if you do . In the 90 's when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top , there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways ( Ice Cube , Easy E , etc ) . Also there were the wanna b 's , accessible rappers that start making the scene ( Vanilla Ice , Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory , etc ) . This movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it 's an actually documentary . Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code ( Rusty Condieff / director ) , Tasty Taste ( Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds , and Tone Def ( Mark Christopher Lawrence ) . They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial . What s good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it . But , if you know 80's/90 's rap , you know how much of this stuff is true . Still , on it 's own , without hip hop knowledge , it is still a funny funny movie . And for all of those who ask , yes Spinal Tap came first , but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either . This , in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways , better than Spinal Tap . As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal , Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap . And the songs are off the hook also . The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists . Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott .
1 I have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture , i 'm white and like classic rock , however , that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy . Its pretty much a sequel of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it is the same movie , just about rap instead or rock . Yet it 's hilarious . There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat . The characters are all very funny and believable . I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a.m. , and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening . One of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different . Rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent . This movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit . Overall , it 's a funny movie with many jokes about racism , sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor . This is highly recommend for any fan of This is Spinal Tap . They are essentially the same movie , just about different worlds , and yes , the same jokes work in both movies .
1 Fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of Hip - Hop culture . It is just as funny as This Is Spinal Tap , if not funnier . The actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb . Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films . This film is a true cult classic !
1 I can not stop saying how much I loved this movie . This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen . The movie follows the exploits of a rap group , NWH ( Ni#$%rs with Hats ) It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group , after it 's tragic break up . Following the group is documentary maker Nina Blackburn . < br /><br />The movie is on a shoestring budget , but it does not seem to matter , this is a very well made , well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent . The main strength of this movie is the writing , there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie , it is unreal . < br /><br />SPOILER < br /><br />There are takeoffs on actual rappers , like MC Slammer , Vanilla Sherbert , Ice Cold , Tone Def , Tastey - Taste , and songs ( Booty Juice , Grab Your Dick , Etc . ) Rusty Condieff has made an excellent film . In the movie he plays rapper Ice Cold . The movie does not quit , it is funny from the beginning to the end . < br /><br />The movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion , but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there . Listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie , like Tone Def telling a record producer , when you take the bus , you get there ' , and the producer responding , that 's deep!'<br /><br />The group portraying N.W.H. has some sort of natural chemistry to them . They work so well together , and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film . What really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is . Many rap groups had problems with violence , with censors , and like NWA , the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics.<br /><br />I like this movie because it is offensive . There is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way . The movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap , the funniest being of Spike Lee . Where they came up with this dialogue I can not imagine . The movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor . As I said before the writing is just excellent.<br /><br />I am not surprised that this movie met such limited release . It is an intelligent , controversial , and even thought provoking film . This is too much for mainstream , despite the fact it is hilarious , and nearly flawless in it 's production . There are no major stars , but a lot of familiar faces , including Marc Lawrence , who plays Tone Def . Watch this movie , at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it .
1 I first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny , similar to CB4 . I was blown away . I was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great . Way better than CB4 , the characters , the songs , the plot , everything . Top notch independent film that was given " Two Thumbs UP " by Siskel and Egbert ( and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick , you know it 's good ) .
1 Having seen both " Fear of a Black Hat " and " This is Spinal Tap " , I can honestly state that while similar , both movies are truly must see . There will be many times in " Fear " that will have you in hysterics . It is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following . " Fear " will soon be available on DVD . Rent it if you must , but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself .
1 its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie , and it gets old telling people it 's rap 's version of spinal tap . and you know , i m sorry i do nt have any better comments , but damnit , go get the movie and watch it , and then make all your friends watch it too , just like i m gon na .
1 Chances are , you 'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it . But if , by chance , you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time ( I 'm well into the hundreds by now ) , you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up ! My friends and I have actually thrown Fear of a Black Hat Parties to get more of our friends , " as they say , down with the riots " .
1 I picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was , but when I watched it I laughed so hard . It is now one of my favorite movies of all time . Rusty and the guys created a masterpiece I would highly recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor . Thank You Rusty for giving us something to laugh at .
1 I first saw this movie on some movie channel ( HBO ? ) some time ago . I was a fan of Public Enemy , NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters . Anyway , the promo for it caught my eye , and I wanted to see what it was all about . Well , right off the bat I knew it was going to be good ( WARNING ! ) and I was right . The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over ( My Peanuts ) , but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great . You 've got to love the satire of rap groups ( obviously NWA ) , certain rappers ( Eazy E , Flava Flav , Ice Cube ) , and the humor of the three members of NWH . Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass ? It 's too bad this movie did n't get the credit it deserved , as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases , but in my opinion is a much better film . If you know and like 90 's ' gangster ' rap , you 'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time . If you are n't into or do n't like ' rap ' , you 'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre .
1 " Fear of a Black Hat " is a superbly crafted film . I was laughing almost continuously from start to finish . If you have the means , I highly recommend viewing this movie It is , by far , the funniest movie I have had the pleasure to experience . Grab your stuff !
1 CB4 was awful , but it may have given Cundieff the idea to it better . More like Spinal Tap than anything else , the film is clever from the start . Surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties . The performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters , more like Marx brothers . These guys are real and slightly diverse . They react to situations like any of us might . Well , we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig , or pull guns and beat down a record company exec , but you get the picture . N(n***as ) W(with ) H(hats ) takes itself seriously enough to reel you in , then you 're hooked . rent or get this at all costs , even if you 're not really into rap music , this will still leave you gassing out loud . Comparing this to CB4 is like comparing George Lucas ' Star Wars to Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers ' I think you see my point
1 If you like CB4 , you have no idea what you 're missing if you have n't seen this film yet . This movie is crazy hilarious , and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody I 've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy . If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old - school performers , definitley rent this movie . There are n't that many video rental places that have copies of it , but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed .
1 This movie is a great mocumentary . It follows the rap group , NWH , made up of Ice Cold , Tasty Taste and Tone Def through their unique path to gangster rap highs , lows and back to highs . Through trouble with women , egos , cops and whitey , this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world , as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries . I know everybodies favorite mocumentary is This is Spinal Tap , for very good reason , however I think that if in the right mood , this movie is simply better . The laughs never end , even for someone not into the rap culture.<br /><br />I'm a white guy , that has no interest in rap music , culture or anything else associated with it , however I love this movie . Rusty Cundeif , who wrote the screenplay , songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that I have n't seen him since Fear of a Black Hat . However , I have seen him one more time than you have , and is that , that I recommend Fear of a Black Hat to you for quick laughs.<br /><br />Remember , " Do n't shoot to you see the whites! .... of their eyes ? No do n't shoot to you see the whites." < br /><br />FYM and enjoy the movie .
1 I am shocked . Shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you IMDB users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7 . 7 ? ! ? ? - that 's a C!. If I could give FOBH a 20 , I 'd gladly do it . This film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy , alongside Half Baked and Mallrats , as one of the most hilarious films of all time . If you know _ anything _ about rap music - YOU MUST SEE THIS ! ! If you know nothing about rap music - learn something ! , and then see this ! Comparisons to ' Spinal Tap ' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film . If you liked Bob Roberts , you 'll love this . Watch it and vote it a 10 !
1 . . . is just as good as the original . Very nearly achieves greatness because of Cundieff 's remarkable ear for music and dialogue . Skewers the self - important swagger of the hip - hop poseurs . The group " Niggaz with Hats " ( NWH ) are every rap group you ever heard and utterly self - parodic . Wardrobe is unbelievable . Buy the OOP soundtrack if you can .
1 Well I do n't personally like rap , but I still found Fear of a Black Hat hilarious . I 'm sure I did n't get some inside jokes , but some I knew , and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after I 'd stopped laughing . I 'm a big fan of Spinal tap , so naturally I had to check this out . It was deriviative from This Is Spinal Tap , sometimes blatantly , but this film still stood on it 's own as an original , intelligent , and funny satire . My personal favorite : " Back in the time of slaves , they did n't have hats to protect them from the sun , so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt . Now we have hats . "
1 I do n't remember when I first heard about this movie , but I rented it about six years ago , and it still remains one of my favorite comedies . I will admit , you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music . But if you are a rap fan , even a casual one , you will love the inside jokes and references . One of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b * * * * and a h * * ; I still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it . One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott , who played nerd Lamar in ` Revenge of the Nerds ' . It is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a DVD release .
1 < br /><br />If you like rap or hip - hop , watch this movie , although it 's funny if you do n't get the references , as a straight comedy.<br /><br />Haven't seen much of the much hyped CB4 , but what I did see did n't have the heart that this little stormer has.<br /><br />Haven't heard from the people involved since , which is a surprise . The film is very similar to Spinal Tap , which is no bad thing , and I think a lot of the dialogue , while priceless in Tap is funnier here , probably because I 'm more into rap than rock theses days , so my own judgment does cloud that point.<br /><br />The rap songs are funny as hell , and it 's basically spot the reference for most of the film , not all of them are in - your - face , which means the physical comedy and the one - liners get priority over the take - offs.<br /><br />Great fun , one to watch twice if there ever was a movie .
1 Just a note to add to the above comment . Fear of a Black Hat does n't have the criminal who 's image has been ripped off by the band , that 's in CB4 . Easily confused as the two films are so similar , but Black Hat is vastly the superior of the two ..... yeah .
1 This early sci - fi masterwork by Herbert George Wells with music by Arthur Bliss is a powerful piece of film - making . Adapted from Wells ' somewhat different work by the author , it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of ' peace ' . The structure is that after a contrasted - pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war , the script allows the war to happen . Two families , the Cabells and the Passworthys disagree about what may happen ; Passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization 's " automatic " progress ; Cabell is the thinker , the doubter . Their city Everytown -- obviously London-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks , a magnificent war march by Bliss , and the end of civilization . The second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a " Boss " , played with bravura by Ralph Richardson , whose woman , lovely Margaretta Scott , is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete - bound dictator type . He is trying to rebuild old WWI airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom ; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes -- etc .-- everlastingly ; this is Wells ' comment on war versus progress . The survivors are subject to a plague called " The Wandering Sickness " also . Enter a modern flying machine piloted by the Cabell of the first section of the film , now part of Wings Over the World , an International Scientists ' Coalition , who are planning to end warfare forever . This flight - suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the Boss and his woman , their attraction being evident ; then Boss sends up his aircraft against them , the Scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the " Gas of Peace " onto the ruins of Everytown . Only the Boss dies , fighting too hard against the pacifying . The film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers . In section three , a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science . Passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the Moon ; Cabell champions man 's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons . The son of Passworthy and Cabell 's daughter , are the astronauts being sent . Theotocopulos , a religious - minded Luddite , makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city 's Forum and leads an attack on the ' space gun ' that is to fire the new rocket free of Earth 's gravity . The climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully ; the denouement and ending is a speech by Cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned . " It is all the universe -- or nothing ! " Cabell tells Passworthy . " Which shall it be ? " As Cabell , Raymond Massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance ; he is thoughtful , compassionate , and reasonable , a true scientist . As the rabble - rouser who wants to end the Age of Science , Cedric Hardwicke is perfect and powerful . Edward Chapman playing Passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear . The storyline is logical , frequently beautiful and always interesting . Given the near - extinction of mankind , the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer . This is a triumph for the director , William Cameron Menzies , for Bliss and for all concerned . Listen to the dialogue with someone you love ; within its constructed limits , this is a thinking man 's drama debating two possible human futures -- progress or its reactionary opposite .
1 I first saw this as a child living in East London . The scars of Hitlers Luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street . I remember having nightmares after seeing it . The odd thing is , it really has n't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in Cinema fiction . < br /><br />Apart from a globally destructive war , the scale of the machines was badly awry , more Nano - Technology now , but overall , an excellent and well - crafted work . It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then . I would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts . However , much was right . Mans desire for war , mans inhumanity to man . The means of war as a catalyst for development . < br /><br / >
1 While a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind , this is still a stunning film that presages the science - fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen . It predicts the global chaos of WWII , but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years , and then tells the epic tale of man 's struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space . The acting seems wooden and strangely sterile , but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie 's release , and which still impress today . This is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the SF genre .
1 I must admit a slight disappointment with this film ; I had read a lot about how spectacular it was , yet the actual futuristic sequences , the Age of Science , take up a very small amount of the film . The sets and are excellent when we get to them , and there are some startling images , but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards ... <br /><br />Much the best drama of the piece is in the mid - section , and then it plays as melodrama , arising from the ' high concept ' science - fiction nature of it all , and insufficiently robust dialogue . There is far more human life in this part though , with the great Ralph Richardson sailing gloriously over - the - top as the small dictator , the " Boss " of the Everytown . I loved Richardson 's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines , dismissing the presence and ideas of Raymond Massey 's aloof , confident visitor . This Boss is a posturing , convincingly deluded figure , unable to realise the small - fry nature of his kingdom ... It 's not a great role , yet Richardson makes a lot of it.<br /><br />Everytown itself is presumably meant to be England , or at least an English town fairly representative of England . Interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things ; the ' things to come ' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal , but to just go on and on . There is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section , concerning more personal ' life ' , yet one is left quite unsatisfied . The film has n't got much interest in subtle complexities ; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle , blunt moralism , every time . And , of course , recall the hedged - bet finale : Raymond Massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are ! < br /><br />Concerning the question of the film being a prediction : I must say it 's not at all bad as such , considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right . The grander conceptions have something to them ; a war in 1940 , well that was perhaps predictable ... Lasting nearly 30 years , mind ! ? A nuclear bomb - the " super gun " or some such contraption - in 2036 ... A technocratic socialist " we do n't believe in independent nation states "- type government , in Britain , after 1970 ... Hmmm , sadly nowhere near on that one , chaps ! ;-) No real politics are gone into here which is a shame ; all that surfaces is a very laudable anti - war sentiment . Generally , it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded - luddite - fascist , as under the Boss , or all - hands - to - the - pump scientific socialism - will * be the deal * , and these implications are not broached ... While we must remember that in 1936 , there was no knowledge at all of how Nazism and Communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers ' vision on other matters.<br /><br />Much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion ; only the briefest stuff from ' 1940 ' would have been necessary , yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous , and it is ages before we get to the Richardson - Massey parts . I would have liked to have seen more done with Margareta Scott ; who is just a trifle sceptical , cutting a flashing - eyed Mediterranean figure to negligible purpose . The character is not explored , or frankly explained or exploited , except for one scene which I shall not spoil , and her relationship with the Boss is n't explored ; but then this was the 1930s , and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then . Edward Chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles ; more so in the first as a hapless chap , praying for war , only to be bluntly put down by another Massey character . Massey himself helps things a lot , playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto , contrasting well with a largely diffident cast , save for Richardson , and Scott and Chapman , slightly.<br /><br />I would say that " Things to Come " is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in Britain in 1936 ; one of the few serious British science fiction films to date , indeed ! Its set ( piece ) design and harnessing of resources are ravenous , marvellous . < br /><br />Yet , the script is ultimately over - earnest and , at times , all over the place . The direction is prone to a flatness , though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion . The cinematographer and Mr Richardson really do salvage things however ; respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology , and an engaging , jerky performance that consistently beguiles . Such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing ; Powell and Pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among British directors as daring visual storytellers , great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate.<br /><br />"Things to Come " , as it stands , is an intriguing oddity , well worth perusing , yet far short of a " Metropolis " ... ' Tis much as " silly " , in Wells ' words , as that Lang film , yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it .
1 Things to Come is that rarity of rarities , a film about ideas . Many films present a vision of the future , but few attempt to show us how that future came about . The first part of the film , when war comes to Everytown , is short but powerful . ( Ironically , film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking England -- appeasement was at its height . Wells ' prediction was borne out all too soon . ) The montage of endless war that follows , while marred by sub - par model work , is most effective . The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design . The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies , and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best work . Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief 's mistress . The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design . The acting in the 21st century story is not compelling -- perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970 . Unfortunately , the model work , representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways , is laughably bad and could have been done much better , even with 30s technology . This is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing . This is redeemed by Raymond Massey 's magnificent speech that concludes the film -- rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well . Massey 's final question is more relevant now than ever , in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight . The scene is aided by the stirring music of Sir Arthur Bliss , whose last name I proudly share.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the VHS versions of this film are absolutely horrible , with serious technical problems . Most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038 . I hope a good DVD exists of the entire film .
1 Aside from the great movie METROPOLIS , this is about the oldest pure sci - fi movie . While at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad , it is a great film for two reasons . First , it is extremely original in both style and content . Even in the 21st century , there are no films I can think of that are anything like it . Second , for its time , the special effects were absolutely incredible -- using matte paintings , models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post - apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow . Sure , you could sit back and knock the film because , by today 's standards , the effects are only so - so . But , you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences . In many ways , the sets look highly reminiscent of the " modern cities " featured at the 1939 WORLD 'S FAIR.<br /><br />I think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question " are people really THAT stupid or are we destined for greatness ? " The end result seems to be a little of both ! How true!<br /><br />A final note : I saw this twice on TV and just a short time ago on video . All three times the sound and print quality stank -- particularly the sound . If this is available on a DVD , hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning . As the sound on the video kept cutting out , I really would have appreciated this !
1 " THINGS TO COME " Movie Review by kWRice < br /><br />Here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place . It is a film I 've only seen in truncated parts , but Art should be taken as a whole . I experienced this film as it was designed , in a darkened theatre , on a silver screen , with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with . That audience and myself were effected by this film ! One woman who lived through WW II was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive , albeit corny , ending.<br /><br />The things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits . The first thing we see is " H.G. Wells " in bold angular block copy much like the " Superman " of yore . It is not the film title , but the creator 's title , and then before any other humans , such as actors or production , are listed , the director William Cameron Menzies is up there ! Who ? You 've probably seen his work before , " Around the World in 80 Days , " " Pride of the Yankees , " and " Gone With the Wind . " He did not direct after this Sci - Fi epic opera he and Mr. Wells created , but his film imagery , sets , and design are very recognizable.<br /><br />That imagery is very effecting . I recognized images from many other films , that have paid homage to this classic . The recent " Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " is obvious , along with Bugs Bunny , " Fantasia , " " Monty Python and the Holy Grail , " " Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow , " " Night of the Living Dead " and more that I know of , but which titles escape me . This is real special effects here , scenes now done with CGI are done with actors , big sets , and detailed models . This film was made in 1936 , and it 's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs . Wells and Menzies also worked with Bliss , doing the music , and Korda , the producer , to create a masterpiece with message , warning , and sermon.<br /><br />The lines the Shakespearean actors Cedric Hardwicke , Ralph Richardson and Raymond Massey speak , sometimes sound preachy , but I also heard lines I still hear now . " These toys children have nowadays are nothing like I had when I was child , " " It 'll help develop their coordination , " " What do we need books for , what do we need to read for ? " , " We do n't need cars , there 's nowhere to go , we have all we need right here , " " There will be no war . " But war there is ! The naive citizens of " Everytown " refuse to see the literal writing on the wall . The never - ending war explodes Christmas eve . The little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me . This is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to Hitler 's appeasement . This war does not end . The poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.<br /><br />It is another dark age . No government , no services , and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about . Plague , warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists . Loved ones are shot in the street , before they can carry the plague to another . Midway there is a marvelous vignette about the Rolls Royce , that is a much needed respite mid - way . Into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future.<br /><br />That future is the third act . The world has rebuilt itself with the help of that " puny animal , man . " Helicopters fly in this film , before they were even invented . The Plumber 's Helper has other uses than the Dalek 's or Glenn Miller 's . Wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses , and orators inciting the people to tear it all down . " Beware the concussion , you have been warned ! " , the city father warns the riotous populace . So be warned , this film might hit you like it hit me . There are some cute miscues and miscalculations , but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again , and I do want to see this artful film again . Others criticize Mr. Wells vision . It is very easy to work with 20/20 hindsight regarding things , costumes and foley miscues . I believe Mr. Wells ' " Things to Come " is not about things , but is actually about concepts , social trends , and philosophical ideals . Besides , we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come . This is not cheap cardboard British Science Fiction , but worthwhile Epic Filmed Opera , sans singing , that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings .
1 I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year . I was enthralled and entertained . It has all the elements of what I love to see in a Sci - Fi story , in a book or on the screen . There 's social commentary , speculation , and a good story.<br /><br />There 's something eerie , and amusing , watching a 1936 view of the ' distant future ' of the 60s and 70s.<br /><br />I think it 's a must see , and not only for Sci - Fiers .
1 The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses ; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general , but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world . When war finally does arrive , it 's ravages continue not for another five years , but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed . Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the " wandering sickness " , a pestilence that continues for another four years.<br /><br />"Things to Come " balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view , where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization . The " Wings Over the World " concept plays out a bit corny , though it 's spokesman Cabal ( Raymond Massey ) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause . If he fails , others will follow . This message is continually reinforced throughout the film , brought home convincingly in Massey 's end of movie speech . Man 's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an " all the universe or nothing " mindset.<br /><br />The film 's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film " Metropolis " . As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 , the spectacle of the city 's rebirth strikes a resonant chord , as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie 's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition . Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man 's first mission to the moon , but in 1936 , a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /><br />"Things to Come " is one of those rarities in film , a picture that makes you think . Which side will you come down on , the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo ? It 's not a comfortable question , as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes . Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control .
1 Things to Come is an early Sci - Fi film that shows an imagined world , or " Everytown " through 100 years . You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts . The film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the " Boss " wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again , after Everytown was bombed and war broke out.<br /><br />This film only has about 3 faults : it 's audio is muddy and video had some quirks , the characters are n't deep at all , and the overall plot is n't altogether solid . The plot is lacking something that I ca n't put my finger on ... it just seems a little " fluffy . " But if you love sci - fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells though might happened in the next hundred years , this is a must see . It 's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing : a long , drawn - out war , because they were just about to go to war with Germany , and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.<br /><br />Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once .
1 I think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed , with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax . What cinema goers made of this in the 30s , I can only imagine . The ' Times ' said at the time , ' A miracle has come to the screen . ' Watch it and marvel .
1 Saw it first in 1975 on some German TV channel and was hooked immediately , afterwards I saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays I have a videotape which I watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect ( direction , acting , cut , musical score ... ) . The sets are outstanding and very impressive , the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film , the dictator of " Everytown " is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is just charming , believable and ideally cast as " the hero " . The positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes , even after watching the film so many times.<br /><br />This movie is good on TV but it was made for the big screen , so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema . please do , it 's overwhelming .
1 I first saw this film 40 years ago on N.Y. television , and thought it was a depressing look at the future . Wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing . ( " no private airplanes " . The 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to British film goers doing the war . The concept of the future , and the Korda an Co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film . The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss . A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous comedy series . It is interesting to note that the Boss 's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time Churchill .
1 H.G. Wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by . He was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour . At the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species , natural biology , on one side , and Marxism , market economy on the other side , were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number . The weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite . He defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race . First of all the non - Caucasian , with the only exception of the Jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages . Then , within the Caucasian community all those who were not healthy , the alcoholics , the mentally disabled , all those who were genetically disabled , etc . That was not Hitler . That was H.G. Wells and that was not after the first world war . That was more than ten years before . And twenty years before the first world war he had published The Time Machine that defended the idea that the human " race " , left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth , would see the differentiation of the human " race " into two " species " : the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species . The point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators . Wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy . The first countries to follow this injunction were the Scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them . The film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election , no parliament , no really democratic institution , only peace imposed by military conquest , and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors . And in that future world all , absolutely all human beings are Caucasians . Wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036 . Amazing . Wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all . The last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets . Frightening . And that was produced in 1936 . All the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of Hitlerism , fascism , Japanese imperialism or Stalinism can be found . But it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of H.G. Wells . We are obviously very far away from the Brave New World of absolute " democratic " social selection , or the Animal Farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat , or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of Big Brother . This vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others . And I only want to compare Wells with the British science fiction writers of his days . It would be unfair to go beyond . This reveals that in England in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals : the fear that the future would only be somber , bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
1 The first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians . The 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources . It has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement . It depicts a space gun / launcher and a helicopter , along with inventive mass communication devices , elevators , flat screen panels , and wireless intercoms . It 's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future . But it portrays a child - like vision of boundless scientific / technological investigation.<br /><br />To me , it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a Spinozean - like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government . The pro - progress characters ( such as the two Cabals ) believe humanity could ' live forever ' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations , always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants.<br /><br />Arthur C. Clarke ( author of 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) suggested this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie . Kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on Clarke 's suggestions ( source : Clarke 's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel ) . Though the late Clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best SF movies . It has a beautiful Menzies art design , but mediocre special effects ( esp . the toy tanks).<br /><br />I personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity . It is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time . It also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress . It seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster . But it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths . It challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness:<br /><br />CABAL : " Too much { rest } and too soon , and we call it death . But for MAN no rest and no ending . He must go on -- conquest beyond conquest . This little planet and its winds and ways , and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him . Then the planets about him , and at last out across immensity to the stars . And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time -- still he will be beginning . " < br /><br />CABAL : " If we are no more than animals -- we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass , mattering no more -- than all the other animals do -- or have done . " { He points out at the stars . } " It is that -- or this ? All the universe -- or nothingness ... " ( quotes from screenplay).<br /><br />If this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress , then the council members ( of the world government ) will seem like technocrats . But actually those " technocrats " allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely , and they would have to be suppressed by government bans , laws against science and experiment , and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants.<br /><br />In fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council 's developments of science and technology , so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council 's freedom to experiment . The progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though , only preparing its ' peace gas ' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress.<br /><br />So it 's also a story about the freedom to do science , just as much as it 's about the wonders of progress . Many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises , except in cases of social bias ( many want to ban cloning , for example ) or naturalism ( some do n't want us to progress freely , and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth ) or fear / reason ( some believe we are n't ready for advanced science / technology since we might destroy ourselves ) . But Cabal ( the president of the council ) has an answer to the problem of danger : " Our { scientific } revolution did not abolish death or danger . It simply made death and danger worth while " ( screenplay ) .
1 If scientists behaved in a way that H.G. Wells was confident they would in the future , history would n't quite have turned out the way it did in Things To Come . Were almost 80 years past the point that Wells wrote The Shape Of Things To Come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before , in some ways farther away.<br /><br />Though such well known players as Raymond Massey , Ralph Richardson , and Cedric Hardwicke are in the cast , they 're more caricatures than real characters . It 's the main weakness with the film , it 's devoted to Wells 's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools.<br /><br />Massey 's characters , two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view . Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward . And Ralph Richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another Thirty Years War fought with modern weapons . By the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented , poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind.<br /><br />According to Wells , science and conquest can never mix . Scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things . In Wells 's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of Hitler and Mussolini . Those same folks however in order to defeat them , subordinated themselves to the Allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age . If they behaved as Wells would have liked them to , someone like Albert Einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after World War II . < br /><br />Wells got it wrong both in time and in development . He apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power . Computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment . Still Things To Come , aided by the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of H.G. Wells , certainly a respected thinker of his time though he did n't quite get right the shape of Things To Come .
1 This sci - fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 . Visually it is a wonder to behold , but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress . This gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times . Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke , both great actors , come off as quite a pair of fanatics . Ralph Richardson is very good as the " The Boss " a megalomaniac warlord . The prediction of World War II was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time . I 'm sure glad that war did n't turn out as it did in the movie . There are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie 's different episodes . Although its not as entertaining as I hoped it would be , this movie sticks in your mind long after you 've seen it .
1 Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film , with ambition and scope hard to find today . They predict World War II and the way Great Britain was attacked , and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race . They change the timing ; in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer , but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it 's amazing . We even see an helicopter ( the film is older than them).<br /><br />Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem Romans with bubble - helmets : if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s , Well 's vision of a rationalistic society , interesting reflections on the nature of power , and John Cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being , the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it.<br /><br />9 1/2 out of 10 . Inspiring like that final monologue by John Cabal .
1 Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction ; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress . It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later , but is woefully naive in it 's Utopian ideals.<br /><br />Raymond Massey , Cedric Hardwicke , and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast , although the drama is played more as a stage piece , than a work of cinema . There are grandiose , if somewhat stilted speeches , often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater . However , there are some profound words there . Is technology the savior of mankind , or the instrument of its destruction ? The film is a visual feast , if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects . Sure , Hollywood is more sophisticated today , but rarely as inventive . For the imaginative , the third act is a treat : a world with underground cities , massive deco bombers , space cannons , gyro copters , and secret organizations of scientist saviors . It has all of the makings of a sci - fi pulp adventure , but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema . They are operatic in scope , and visually inspiring . Technology has long left them behind , but their ideas still burst forth . There is an artistry there , one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass - produced cinema of today . These films are the products of artisans , not industrialists .
1 Amazing effects for a movie of this time . A primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself.<br /><br />A wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive.org . No charge , no sign up necessary . Watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled.<br /><br />I plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as I had never heard of it before and I am a hard core sci fi fan.<br /><br />I would like to see how others react to this movie.<br /><br />Watch it.<br /><br />Rate it.<br /><br />Tell us what you think .

1 I have , " Things to Come , " on D.V.D. and it 's very clear compared to my VHS version . The audio is fair , but can be hard to understand at times . < br /><br />I liked the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it . It gave details of why some things happened . The best things about the movie are the small things that I did n't notice at first . Such as , John Cabal playing with a toy airplane at a Christmass party , like it was a dive bomber , out dateing sea power by naming a battleship,"Dinosuar . " Ships sunk by air - power , an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes . Swept flying wing planes . Strong rolls for the women through the entire movie . < br /><br />There are more , see the movie to enjoy them .
1 With such actors as Ralph Richardson , Raymond Massey , Cedrick Hardwicke , and Margaretta Scott , how can you go wrong . Very unusual scenics , especially the modern ones . The realization of the modern machinery is very effective . Here you have ray - gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area , so new structures can be made . Although she 's much younger in this film , It 's not very hard to figure out who the future Mrs. Pumphrey from the BBC series , All Creatures Great and Small is going to be ! Really effective " reappearance " of both Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson . The musical score is by the renowned Swiss composer , Artur Honegger and it is also unusual . For the time ( 1936 ) it looks like they used really , large sets or the effects make it seem that way . Lastly , it 's a really good story .
1 This movie is difficult to watch in our fast - paced culture of the 21st century , but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys , chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society , specifically when that technology is used for warfare.<br /><br />This movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology , but as the circle completes itself , familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self - serving rather than self - destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology.<br /><br />Brilliant for it 's time , the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some , but as a landmark in the history , development , and evolution of the sci - fi genre , it is a must . In the end , free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed , the state of < br /><br />society itself , as shaped by world events.<br /><br />Those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so , but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains , as this film posits.<br /><br />As far as qualifying as sci - fi , one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it 's speculative nature . It asks us the questions , what if these events happened this way , and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it ? How would we react?<br /><br />As far as influence , this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci - fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions .
1 SYNOPSIS The future as seen from 1939 England . As war loomed over Europe , the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past . It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man 's past mistakes.<br /><br />CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER Beware your leaders and what you are told . Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow . There will always be descent and fear , and learning to overcome it is our only hope.<br /><br />PROS AND CONS I had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet ( it is in the public domain ) . This is a fascinating work on numerous levels . Since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939 , it has obvious flaws . This vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical . This film was cutting edge for its day . The special effects are very good as is the story line . The acting suffers a bit in the British theatrical sense , in that it can lean a bit toward Shakespeare.<br /><br />One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems , which we now know is not always true . The films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us.<br /><br />The underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film . The set design and wardrobe of " Forbidden Planet " , the failings of technology in " 2001 : A Space Odessy " , even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of " Star Wars " owe some amount of inspiration to this film.<br /><br />The ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed . While it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars , we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it . Even as we reach , there are those that are trying to hold us back . This films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards . Huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world , but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step.<br /><br />Many great British actors are in this film as young men . Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here . Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the lead character , Cabel . His character almost comes across as the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science.<br /><br />This is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark .
1 This is an amazing movie from 1936 . Although the first hour is n't very interesting ( for the modern viewer ) , the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it . However , do n't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents ( it 's American - but " 1930s " American ) make it difficult.<br /><br />Basically , the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional US town called " Everytown " . It spans from 1936 , when a war is on the horizon , to 2036 , when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems.<br /><br />The first one hour is a bit slow - although it 's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought . The events , suspense and visuals are pretty low - key in today 's terms . However , when it gets to the future , it 's just plain fun to watch . The large sets and retro sci - fi look of everything is hard to beat.<br /><br />Unless you have great listening abilities , this movie is hard to listen to . I think I understood only 80 % of the dialog . It could use closed - captioning.<br /><br />If you 're a sci - fi fan , this is one of the genre 's classics and is a must see ( well , at least after the first hour ) .

1 this was the most costly film , when produced . Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were both distressed by its poor ratings --- for good reason . it was and remains far ahead of its time . aside from the seemingly poor direction , probably editing , at the very beginning , the work moves along to a stunning conclusion.<br /><br />whether its Sir Ralph Richardson 's ' Boss ' role , or even better , his wife 's , Sir Cedric 's , as adversary to space - faring , Raymond Massey 's ' John Cabal ' center role --- all deliver mind - boggling performances.<br /><br />the scene with mr . Korda 's incomparable set , of the small girl - child , running out to an absolutely ' never - to - be - matched ' scene , commenting ' Life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier ' ? that swiftly brings tears to any parent / grandparent . this is not a film for the young -- unless ' experienced ' and rather those who have seen ' the horror ' it opposes.<br /><br />sure , the ' phony - parachuting ' , looks hokey --- while using a ' magnetic - cannon ' , now termed ' mass - driver ' may be viewed as ridiculous , vs. rockets --- give Sir Korda a break -- Mr . Wells made that choice . and at + /- $ 8 million , this film went way beyond ' over - budget'---so he concentrated on what he could manage.<br /><br />the true power of this Greatest of cinema rests in ' John Cabal 's ' final statement of human destiny --- his friend ' Passworthy ' doubts the wisdom of space - faring , saying , ' We 're such little animals . ' John Cabal 's proper response is,(paraphrased ) ' Yes , little animals , and if that is all we are , we must live and die as such . ' they are standing under a large astronomical telescope . he sweeps his hand over the night sky . ' Yet we may have all the Universe , or nothing.'---then the final chorus breaks in---'Which shall it be?'---this is not ' Star Wars ' , ' Blade Runner'---anything you may consider ' Great'---this is the Real Thing.<br /><br />i remind all of Steven Hawking 's most recent address , upon his latest ' Medal of Honor'---'Humanity must leave Earth , or die.'---the very core of this work --- i love ' standard entertainment'---yet this ' relic ' , for the wise viewer , offers far more . ' Which Shall It Be ?

1 Things to Come is an historic film . Along with Metropolis ( 1927 ) , it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles . It is also one of the first doomsday movies . It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the Second World War within a year , and even , in a subtle way , the year it would end in the real world . But then the film departs from reality , depicting a world ravaged by war ( only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936).<br /><br />The last half hour of the film is an incredible sight , making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre . It is sad that , after Things to Come , Sci - fi would become identified with cheaply made b - movies , a stereotype that would n't be broken until 2001:A Space Odyssey more than 30 years later . If they 'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film , things would have been very different in Hollywood . < br /><br />Raymond Massey and some of his co - stars play multiple roles in this film , to good effect . Massey plays a great " Doctor Who "- like role as a pilot from an advanced ( for 1970 ) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple - minded warlord ( a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson ) . Ultimately , the storyline covers 100 years . But that 's a big problem with this film -- there really is n't a cohesive storyline.<br /><br />Perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of Intolerance , actually -- it 's hard to have a conventional plot , but I felt more could have been made of the material , and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting . Maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci - fi innovation : a sequel?<br /><br />Things to Come is a film every serious sci - fi buff should see at least once . Unlike Metropolis , however , it might not bear repeated viewings .
1 There be very little doubt that HG Wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century . Jules Verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices . Wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales . Perhaps his greatest legacy is that there 's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including Richard Dawkins consider it a near certainty . There 's no evidence of this of course and one ca n't help wondering that is was Wells who introduced this to human thinking ? Undoubtedly it was Wells that planted the seed .<br /><br />THINGS TO COME was adapted by Wells himself from his own novel . It is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays . The dialouge is often laden , heavy handed and unconvincing . One case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war " Why must we murder one another . Why ? " This mirrors the criticism , near naked contempt that Orwell had of Wells in his essay Wells , Hitler And The World State and it is true that Wells anti - war message is painfully overstated . It 'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an RAF pilot and his opposite number in the Luftwaffe a few years later < br /><br />That said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation . There 's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of The Wanderng Sickness is wonderfully realised . Even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature It 's the images that makes this film along with Arthur Bliss score that makes the film so memorable . And to be fair Wells does ask the question " The universe or nothing . What shall it be ? " . In short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive
1 This film , in my opinion , is , despite it 's flaws ( which I maintain are * few * ) , an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art.<br /><br />What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films . He does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience . If it were not for Mr. Bakshi , I do n't believe animation would have survived the Disney onslaught . What is more , with The Lord of the Rings , he has not only created a beautiful animated film , but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground.<br /><br />Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film ( the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation ) . But I feel that the people who complain about it simply can not accept an art form which is out of the norm . No , this is not Disney animation . No it 's not live action . No , it 's not " cheating " - what it is is a new , fascinating , and absolutely wonderful art form . Something so fresh , and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as " The Lord of the Rings " . Bakshi 's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of Middle Earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way , in particular , the darker of Tolkien 's creatures , particularly the Nazgul , are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish.<br /><br />Peter S. Beagle 's screenplay ( based very little , as I understand it , on an early draft by Chris Conkling ) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien 's works . Where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which Bakshi has created . There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film , but there are very few changes to the storyline . There are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled : The reforging of Narsil , the gifts of Galadriel , the Huorns at the battle of the Hornburg , but , again , with the time limitations he had ( already the longest animated feature in history ) , these are certainly understandable ( though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel).<br /><br />Also there is the delightful ( one of my favorites ) score by Leonard Rosenman ( who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV ( the score for which is clearly based on his LotR work ) ) . It is bombastic and audacious and , dare I say , perfect . It stands on it 's own as an orchestral triumph , but when coupled with the images of the film , it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection . So far from the typical Hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off.<br /><br />The voice actors are wonderful . Of particular note is John Hurt as Aragorn who just oozes the essence of Strider.<br /><br />The character design is also wonderfully unique , though not often to everyone 's taste . But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he / she imagines , not what you might have imagined , and so Aragorn is realized with a distinctive Native American feel and Boromir appears in Viking inspired garb . This is perhaps not what you imagined , but I can only applaud Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he " saw " . It also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film.<br /><br />One farther word - the Flight to the Ford sequence , in my opinion , is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid . Bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment , and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build . Bakshi 's artistic ability and Tolkien 's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled.<br /><br />The recent DVD release ( 2001 ) by Warner Brothers , is sorely lacking . While we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format , the package is woefully short of extras . How glorious it would have been to have had a director 's commentary , been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release . Another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over . Also present in the DVD release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film . This version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score.<br /><br />Of course , the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made . We will never be able to see Bakshi 's interpretation of Gondor , of Shelob , of Faramir , of the Cracks of Doom , of Eowyn 's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf 's confrontation with him . We will never be graced with Bakshi 's image of Denethor or the Palatir or the Paths of the Dead . It is a shame beyond all shames that we will , in the end , have to accept Peter Jackson 's glitz and glitter Hollywood , action film version of these later events in Tolkien 's masterpiece , but , I suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all.<br /><br />David
1 More than twenty years before Peter Jackson 's visionary adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings , there was this 1978 animated effort from director Ralph Bakshi . An ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story , this has sadly been rather over - shadowed by the Jackson trilogy . Indeed , many reviewers here on the IMDb ( mainly those who saw the newer version first ) seem to be fiercely unkind to this version .... but if one applies a little common sense , and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time , then they will realise that this is a pretty good film . Indeed , it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early ' 80s that I sought out Tolkien 's book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed Middle Earth adventures . So , in some respects , I owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever.<br /><br />Sauron , the Dark Lord of Middle Earth , forges an all - powerful ring that gives him incredible power . Following a great battle during which Sauron is defeated , the ring falls into possession of a king named Isildur  . but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it . For centuries the ring passes from hand to hand , eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who lives in a peace - loving community known as The Shire . Frodo learns from a wizard named Gandalf that his ring is in fact The One Ring , the very same that was forged by Sauron all those centuries ago , and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land . Frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions , but every step of the way they are hunted by Sauron 's ring - wraiths , the Black Riders . There follow many adventures , during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be " unmade "  Mount Doom , in the land of Mordor . The film concludes with Frodo and his best friend Sam on the borders of Mordor , closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination . Meanwhile Gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of Helm 's Deep.<br /><br />This version covers just over half of the original book . A second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end , but was sadly never completed . While the ending feels abrupt , it does at least end at a sensible point in the story . One has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal . The animation is passable , with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail . The music by Leonard Rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative . The voice - overs are decent , too , especially John Hurt as Aragorn and Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum . On the other hand , Michael Scholes - who provides the voice for Sam - is rather campy and goofy , which is not well suited to the character . The Lord Of The Rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based .
1 As an animated film from 1978 , this is pretty good -- generally well above the standard of the days when Disney had n't done anything good in years ( and Tolkien cared little for Disney anyway ) . It gets major points for innovative and careful camera work , applying cinematic techniques with relative success . The much - maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well , especially with the Ringwraiths , and the opening narration . However , it is so drastically overused -- possibly as a money - saving technique -- that it detracts from the overall effect . The same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly does n't fare so well in the Prancing Pony.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the story , it 's actually quite good . We lose little bits here and there , minor details such as the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil , the Gaffer and the Sackville - Bagginses . We compress a few characters , such as revising Legolas as one of Elrond 's household and an old friend of Aragorn 's , but that 's a rather wise decision for film . In books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the Elves and Middle - Earth 's vast history . In film , you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way . Nothing critical is truly lost here , and although I have minor quibbles about some of the changes , I 'm generally pretty happy with it.<br /><br />If only the dratted writers had managed to remember Saruman 's name -- he 's frequently referred to as Aruman , a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly - named Sauron ; it took me a second viewing before I was certain I had n't misheard it . It 's also annoying that Boromir is a bloody stage viking , and irritable from the start . However , Gandalf is excellent , and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent . If only John Hurt were n't too old to play Aragorn ; I love his voice.<br /><br />Of course , with the film ending at the midpoint of the story , there 's a vast disappointment built in . What makes it far , far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the Rankin & Bass crew on the sequel . That they were permitted to do Return of the King after butchering The Hobbit remains a huge mystery ; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling . For all its faults , this film 's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task . I can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision ...
1 Godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one , and probably the strongest kind that could be made about Ralph Bakshi 's take on Tolkien 's magnum opus the Lord of the Rings , has actually been made by Peter Jackson . The recent trilogy , to me , are n't even total masterpieces , but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post - modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good , sweeping entertainments . < br /><br />But as one who has not read the books , I end up now looking upon the two versions , live - action ( albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way ) and animated ( albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework ) in relation to just the basic story , not even complete faithfulness to the books . And with Bakshi 's version , it 's almost not fair in a way , as what we do see is really not the complete vision , not what Jackson really had ( probably final cut ) . Robbed of Return of the King 's big climactic rush of the story , and with the other two parts becoming rushed , I ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations , though as such those same limitations make it disappointing.<br /><br />What 's interesting too , after seeing the Jackson films first- which I also slightly regret being that I might 've reacted to this differently when I was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with . Everything that is really needed to tell the Fellowship of the Ring story is actually pretty much intact , and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkien 's book is given some clarity in this section . The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes , are more or less adequate for the parts , with a few parts standing out ( John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf ) . < br /><br />The lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face - value for those who 've not even seen the other films or read the books and ca n't put them into context . But there is some level of interest always with the characters , and here there 's a more old - fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more . This is not a garden variety Disney adaptation- warts and all , this is a Bakshi film , with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earth.<br /><br />And what Bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen , in all its abbreviated form , its hit or miss appeal . Along with being not totally complete as a film , or as stories , the form of the film is an experiment , to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped . The results end up bringing what seems now to be retro , but at the time of course was something that was a rough , crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers . Might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation ? In some parts , yeah ; it does become a little noticeable , as was also the case in Bakshi 's American Pop , that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky , like some kind of comic - book form done in a different way . Still , there 's much I admired in what was done . < br /><br />The orcs , for example , I found to be really amazing in they 're surreal surroundings . They 're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live - action , especially during parts where there is n't battle footage ( that 's really the real hit - or - miss section , as there is n't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping ) , and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback . It 's creepy in a good way . And the backgrounds , while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy , are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together . It 's almost something for art - film buffs as much as for the ring - nuts.<br /><br />So , how would I recommend this animated take on the Lord of the Rings ? I do n't know , to tell the truth . It 's certainly a good notch above the other Tolkien animated film I 've seen , the Hobbit ( and I 've yet to see the animated ROTK ) , and there is some real artistry going on . There 's also some stilted dialog , an all - too - rushed Two Towers segment with the most intriguing character Gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all . And seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films . < br /><br />If you 're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out , I would say it 's worth a chance , even if it 's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not . As for it fitting into Bakshi 's other films I 've seen it 's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement , where as with Lynch 's Dune it 's bound to draw a dark , mordor - like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who do n't . I do n't .
1 First of all , the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they ca n't stand a few parts of the true story being " altered " . Well guess what ? Peter Jackson 's film was n't a perfect rendition either . Well enough ranting . This is a very beautiful film . The backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known Tolkein artists . The film covers about half the trilogy ( Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers ) and moves at a good pace . The voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like I imagined they would . Samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes , but Aragorn looks AWESOME . The film has a great score that completely supports the movie . If you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading ( the books are even better ) give this movie a try , keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago.<br /><br />Also of particular note : Peter Jackson 's adaption of Fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as Ralph Bakshi 's ( Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi 's effort ) .
1 I 'm fond of this film and it vexes me that so many " reviewers " rank it below the Peter Jackson trilogy . A filmed novel is always interpretive ; in particular an animated film relies on the artist 's vision and should be judged on its own terms . Speaking as a purist , this is a finer homage to Tolkien than the updated version . While this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source , especially so far as the characters are concerned.<br /><br />In the Jackson version Tolkien 's Frodo is barely recognizable : from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling , constantly wavering , manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet ( this is physically and metaphorically true . ) You wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the Cracks of Doom . Jackson unforgivably rewrites Tolkien and robs Frodo of his finest moment when he allows Arwen to rescue him from the Ringwraiths ... Bakshi 's version respects the original , presenting a Frodo who demands the wraiths " Go back and trouble me no more ! " Bakshi sustains Frodo 's character as Tolkien conceived it . We see his decline as the weight of his burden increases . Frodo is so pivotal to Lord of the Rings you wonder why Jackson took such liberties ( he does so with numerous characters)since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion . Bakshi 's film better explores the companionship between Legolas and Gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in Jackson 's version . Similarly we see Boromir horsing with Pippin and Merry , furthering the idea of fellowship . For my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action.<br /><br />Tolkien 's poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and Bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes : when Frodo sings the " Merry Old Inn " song , minutes before stumbling into Strider . The cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later , invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths , Frodo is dangerously exposed . This is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever I see it.<br /><br />The well documented budget / time restrictions limit this film 's final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers . As it is , it 's worth a look . Even its detractors admit that Peter Jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype .
1 First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book , especially when you 're dealing with master writer like Tolkien . This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien 's universe with 1970s psychedelia , aesthetics , and liberal culture . Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little " rough " in its technical execution but it 's beautiful none the less , and very evocative in terms of giving a unique " sense of place " to each of the scenes . Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that 's FAR superior to the acting in the new live action movies . And while the cell animation might not be the most " technically proficient " animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced . The background paintings vary from traditional " fantasy " motif to outright abstraction , but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film . If you 're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting , transcendental imagery , and JRR Tolkien then this film is a must see .
1 My friend had the idea of watching the animated LOTR after seeing the Peter Jackson Return of The King . So I finally bought it off e - bay , thinking right from the start it was going to suck . Actually , it really was n't as bad as I thought it would be . The animation was good for its time , they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects , and the guy who did the voice for Frodo sounded somewhat like Elijah Wood.<br /><br />Not the greatest adaptation of a book , but trust me , I 've seen a lot worse . It skips quite a lot of things , since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into one two hour movie . Definatley worth a watch , kids might like , but still , absoutley no comparision with the Peter Jackson trilogy .
1 I happened upon this movie as an 8 - 10 year old on a cold , dark November afternoon . I was outside playing all day , freezing , and when I came in around 4 pm , I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the TV with a blanket . I was surprised to be watching a cartoon that was n't all happy and silly -- and was in fact dark , and moralistic . It captured my imagination . I 'm sure it misses the text , and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist . But it still captures the spirit of the story , the choice to carry a burden for the good of others , the consequences of selfish , rash decisions , etc . The quality of animation leaves room for complaint . But the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations . John Hurt is great in this . If you do n't like how the character is drawn , look away , and just listen to him . His voice is extraordinary . I 've seen it again many , many times and it always brings me back to that time , as a kid , thirsty for some magical adventure . It 's for this reason I say ' lucky ' , the film is nostalgic for me so I overlook its shortcomings . But between John Hurt , and Tolkien 's fantasy , it still reached me , and still does .
1 Peter Jacksons version(s ) are better films overall from objective point of view . That being said , they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings , and let me explain why . < br /><br />Firstly , the acting of the on - screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson 's LOTR . The whole cast is too run of the mill . " Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people ? " one could ask . Well , they are not really silly(save for Hobbits , later about them ) and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson 's party - even with much more limited dialogue time . And that is because of superior _ voice _ acting of the Bakshi 's LOTR . Take Aragorn for example . In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority(Aragorn the lord)and with a seasoned rasp(Aragorn the ranger ) . This is due to John Hurt 's brilliant voice acting . Compare that to Viggo Mortensen 's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven : Hurt beats Mortensen hands down . < br /><br />And then there is Gandalf . Probably the most dominating(and the most popular ) character in the whole saga . In this Bakshi version Gandalf(William Squire ) is a real wizard . And by that I do n't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips(he does not ) , but his presence is just captivating . He is a mystical , powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease . Add to that his looks : Tall , old as the ancient oak , beard long as his body , sharp eyes , wizardy hook nose and of course , the classical wizard hat . A Perfect Gandalf , just like in the books . Ian McKellen 's Gandalf in the other hand , is simply just too boring . He looks too human , sounds too human , acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword . Yes a sword . In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword(as he did in the books ) . And those are stylish slow motion kills . Gandalf is not a power to be messed with . And it must be noted , that while I 'm sad to say this , the great Christopher Lee did n't bring Saruman alive . Fraser Kerr in this movie did , even with a very limited screen time and lines.<br /><br />Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie , it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jackson 's pretendeous bad guys . Bakshi 's orcs taunt their enemies(or each other ) constantly with growls , screams and nasty language . They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion . And finally , the Black Riders - or the Nazgul . Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black . And they speak with haunting voice , which mesmerizes their victim . My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river . While Peter Jackson could n't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party , Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky.<br /><br />But as much I like this film more than Jackson 's , the latter are , if only technically , still better . And that is because of some key visuals . As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated characters(all hobbits and the main cast ) and real actors covered with paint . I do n't really have a problem using real people in animation this way , but they just do n't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures . This is especially true with humans(Riders of Rohan , tavern people etc . ) Orcs are different matter , since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters . Orcs , while played by humans with animation mix , look far superior to Jacksons version . They have brownish - green skin , shiny red eyes , flat face and pointed teeth . < br /><br />Biggest screw up in this films visuals , howerver , are the Hobbits . While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson , the latter has clearly superior Hobbits , in fact they are perfect . With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies . And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them , so be warned . Again , the voice acting is OK with them too , but the actors mouths can not save the " immersion damage " made by these little weasels . Well , I never really liked those halflings anyway . < br /><br />General failures in the Bakshi script are well known . Limited playing time(with limited budget ) and a lot of missing scenes . So while this film covers nearly half of the story , it does n't do it in extensive detail compared to Jackson 's version . < br /><br />In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior:<br /><br />-overall atmosphere ( it feels more like Middle - Earth ) -overall voice acting -music ( I really dig the fantasy score by Kont & Rosenman ) -Gandalf -Aragorn ( One of the John Hurt 's finest roles ) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond ( He 's not some fairy hippie in this one!)<br /><br />While Jackson version is better:<br /><br />-because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits < br /><br />Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi , even with it 's well known shortcomings , is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien 's fantasy world very well , if not perfectly . I 'll give it a score of 8½ out of 10 .
1 When a small hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle , the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord . Should the ring end up back in his hands , he will regain his power and destroy Middle Earth . Frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors . This is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story . Regardless , this is an epic and wonderfully animated film.<br /><br />The animation is superbly done with rotoscope , which is tracing over live action footage . Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given . The film also boasts a grand music score by Leonard Rosenman that fits every scene . There are a few plot holes with the script , but that has to be excused , considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films , much had to crammed in the first one . My biggest gripe is some of the character design , Samwise was a bit too goofy , while the other hobbits act completely normal . The other characters are actually well written for the screen , and the voice actors do a great job , I was pleased that Legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot . The rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening , while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish.<br /><br />Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman , thanks to the writers . Overall , I think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice , but there is something charming about it . Ralph Bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories . The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films , but it 's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages .
1 With the release of Peter Jackson 's famed " Lord of the Rings " trilogy , it is even easier to dismiss Ralph Bakshi 's 1978 animated Lord of the Rings film as inferior . I agree with the majority that Jackson 's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of Tolkien 's work , but that does not prevent me from enjoying Bakshi 's ambitious pioneering effort . Jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing Bakshi 's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations.<br /><br />The film 's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable . I was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters . The pairs of Pippin and Merry and Eowyn and Galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually , the Balrog and Treebeard were unimpressive , but these points did n't bother me very much . However , the Nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie . The only character representation I was bothered by was Sam 's ; he was made to look unbecomingly silly.<br /><br />This film is novel for its animation techniques . In addition to hand - drawn characters , live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping . It is quite apparent which characters are hand - drawn and which are rotoscoped , but none the less I found that the film 's style was a novelty . The use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well.<br /><br />The voice acting was generally of high quality . Particularly good was John Hurt , who provided an authoritative voice for Aragorn . Aragorn is n't a favorite character of mine from the stories , but backed by John Hurt 's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation . My other favorite was William Squire , whose voice is appropriately strong for Gandalf . The only actor who seemed inappropriate was Michael Scholes as Sam , whose voice acting was irritating and added to Sam 's unfortunately silly image . The only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names . Particularly strange was the decision to frequently have Saruman referred to as " Aruman".<br /><br />In producing this film , Ralph Bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films . Hence , this film contains about half the story , from the start of " The Fellowship of the Ring " to the end of the battle at Helm 's Deep in " The Two Towers " . The obvious implication of this is that the film 's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books . I enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations , but the liberties taken to compress the story did n't bother me , even the choice to leave Arwen out of the story . Enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the Lord of the Rings story in 132 minutes . The battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at Helm 's Deep were tremendous.<br /><br />Ralph Bakshi 's version of " The Lord of the Rings " is n't perfect and no doubt a number of Lord of the Rings readers lament the cuts to the story . However , for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy . My only strong lament is that I am unable to see the second part of this " first great tale " of The Lord of the Rings since Bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel .
1 I remember watching this late at night on black and white TV , long before a live - action version was so much as a twinkle in Peter Jackson 's eye ... and being very impressed . Finally getting my hands this week on a VHS copy that was being thrown away ( and is n't that just par for the course .. ? ) I had the chance to revisit this film , and found that it still stands up quite well , although it 's not quite the success that memory had painted.<br /><br />I have to confess to a certain bias here . Some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed Jackson - lovers , others as Jackson - haters ; I 'm not exactly either . I was a devotee of the BBC Radio adaptation by Brian Sibley originally broadcast in 1981 , and instantly recognised the voice of Gollum here -- Peter Woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note - perfect for the radio three years later.<br /><br />I must say , however , that where I found Jackson 's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment , the Bakshi version , for all that it has been cut to the bone , is actually more accurate . Yes , there are the usual , understandable changes ( here it is Legolas rather than Arwen who is substituted for Glorfindel as the Elf sent from Rivendell to meet the party ) and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action . ( The only exception to the latter , as others have remarked , is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of Rivendell , where the Ringwraiths , having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back Frodo in mid - flight -- which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river -- then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop , which is initially nightmarish but pointless , plot - wise , and definitely goes on too long . ) I would also agree that the Balrog is unsatisfactory , due partly to bad animation , and that Gandalf windmills his arms too much.<br /><br />But having watched both approaches to the film , I feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take . In a tale that is half - myth ( oddly enough , one thing that is included is a snippet of Aragorn 's story of Beren and Luthien ) the extreme literalism required by live - action filming , where everything from monsters to mail - shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera , is counter - productive : latex - faced ( or CGI ) monsters are less monstrous than sketchily - drawn shapes , heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies , and hobbits or dwarfs with non - human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly . Many reviewers have cited the sniffing Ringwraith in the woods , with its crippled , half - human movements , as one of the scariest moments in the film -- it certainly frightened me silly when I saw it for the first time alone in the dark!<br /><br />The extreme stylisation of the introduction ( plus a voice - over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back - story in a few sentences ) works very well to depict an almost mythical era , and the change to the comic - book rusticism of the Shire -- I particularly like the Proudfeet -- corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of Tolkien 's prose . I did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect : Gandalf threatening Bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes , Bilbo seeming to become a Gollum - like creature under the influence of Ring - lust at Rivendell , and Galadriel 's famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight , where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits ' changed perceptions . But generally speaking the changes in detail and palette -- firelight hues at Bree , bright colours re - emerging at Rivendell and in the Fangorn clearing , dirty greys and browns for Moria and the desolate lands -- work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes , where a live - action approach simply does n't allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting.<br /><br />As a fan I did n't care for either Jackson 's or Bakshi 's depiction of Lothlorien -- again , I feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation I 've come across of a beautiful , slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time -- and I feel that Bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong , but I do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the Company relaxing together after their travails in Moria . Aragorn giving a hobbit - fencing - lesson here is as charming ( and equally uncanonical ) a spectacle as Boromir engaging with the hobbits in Hollin in the Jackson version.<br /><br />The depiction of Aragorn as convincingly weatherworn Ranger is good throughout this film ( Viggo Mortensen 's scruffy Jesus look really did n't work for me ) , although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to ' clean up ' the character in the second half for Gondor 's benefit . John Hurt , unsurprisingly , gives a sterling vocal performance , as does a resonant William Squire in the part of Gandalf . The hobbits are , I suspect , intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience - identification figures : I find the animated style ( their proportions are much more ' cartoonish ' than those of the human characters ) works well to differentiate them , and the whole ' hairy feet ' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions , including much fan art.<br /><br />Personally I have less objection to Boromir as Viking -- he was always a fairly bludgeoning type -- than to beardy - Aragorn ( illogical : they were both Numenorians , after all ) , although I am clearly in a minority here!<br /><br />The big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project , with a bizarre tacked - on voice - over ending attempting to resolve matters . A pity ; it would have been interesting , not to mention less frustrating , to see what Bakshi planned to make of Shelob and Minas Tirith , never mind the Dead ...
1 There seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net . Those who hate it and curse Ralph Bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious . I 'm inclined to be in the middle . I'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film ( e.g.the cruel cutting of the story , badly rotoscoped charecters , over acting etc ... ) But dispite this I still love this film . The rotoscoping ( when done properly)adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic . The surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase Frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score ... magic . Sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film.<br /><br />(No doubt I 'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review , ah well , such is life )
1 I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after seeing the FANTASTIC 2001 live action version of the film . The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtably be far better than George Lucas ' Star Wars " prequel " trilogy ( Episodes 1 - 3 ) will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century!<br /><br />I remember seeing the animated version as a child , and I did n't quite understand the depth of the film at that time . Now that I have read the books , I understand what the whole storyline is all about . To be sure , some of the characters are quite silly , ( Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying , almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One , ( AWFUL ! ) ) but , I have to say it follows the book rather closely , and it goes into part of book two , The Two Towers . The good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it 's time . The bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through The Two Towers without any result of Frodo 's quest to destroy the one ring , and the animation looks quite dated compared to today 's standards . < br /><br />Overall , not AS bad as many say it is . BUT , the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings ! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously ! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books , which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film , so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter ! I 'll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter anyday!<br /><br />A 7 out of a scale of 1 - 10 , far LESS violent than the 2001 live action version , but NOWHERE near as good ! For diehard fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings .
1 One thing i can say about this movie is well long , VERY LONG ! I actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out . I was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because The 70 's ( even though i never lived in them ) is actually one of my favourite decades , especially for the music ! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive . i will admitt the animation did impress me ! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see . but the movie honestly could of been a bit better , it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting . then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly . in my opinion i thought it was EXTREMELY long . i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie , it made it seem like it was 4 hours long ! ! ! ! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those " nothing to do days " . i will see the new one and i hope it is better !
1 < br /><br />I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night . I 've been a fan of Tolkien 's work for about 4 years now , ever since I got out of high school . I did n't grow up on this movie ... perhaps my mother kept me away from it . It 's definitely not for children . Not that it 's bad in a graphic sense , but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads . Overall , the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979 . I thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense . But I am bothered that Bashki did n't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the Return of the King parts . That would 've made it the ultimate movie . I was bothered by it 's abrupt end , and then when I heard Return of the King sucked , I was bothered even more . Too bad it was n't one great animation film . It might have garnered a higher vote from me . I give it a 7 . I can only hope Peter Jackson will do the books justice with the new live action LOTR .
1 If you have read the books then forget the characters that Tolkien built in your head . The representation of hobbits , dwarves etc have had the ' disney ' treatment . The dark riders are excellent , and as I had always imagined from the books.<br /><br />Cinematically this is an excellent film , mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year . I only wish he ( Bakshi ) had been given the money to complete his epic.<br /><br />It 's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 Lord of the Rings ! !
1 It 's been quite some time since I 've watched this LOTR . I am currently hunting for a copy to purchase . Bakshi 's work is quite true to the original work . The visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting.<br /><br />Drawbacks ? Occasionally , the movie is confusing or muddled . There are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl . But , overall -- buy this movie . It 's great for kids , adults and collectors .
1 Brilliant movie . The drawings were just amazing . Too bad it ended before it begun . I´ve waited 21 years for a sequel , but nooooo ! ! !
1 Well , I get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that do n't reflect my experience at all . To me , Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies . He was a die - hard villain , a no - apologies villain . To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy is n't sort of undercut in some way.<br /><br />The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast . There I think maybe the director could have done better . But , to be honest , the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel . She is an unsung heroine , a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered . But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi 's wife . She may be given little to do , but she does everything with total conviction . I 'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.<br /><br />So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average , you wo n't get much out of this movie . But if you constantly search for something more , then this might give you some of what you 've been missing .
1 Not many reviews , hence thought i would add one.<br /><br />DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS ! This was a excellent movie.<br /><br />RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie.<br /><br />AB and Akshay given yet another example of great acting , as does bhoomika too , which was a little unexpected , but great to watch.<br /><br />Am surprised there has not been much hype around release.<br /><br />Or filmfare / other awards nominations , considering how good the movie was.<br /><br />Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie.<br /><br />Is a fairly long movie , but definitely worth it and while watching it , definitely does seem long.<br /><br />Cant wait for RKS next movie and the next AB , Akshay movie they always seem to do well together ... e.g. waqt.<br /><br />Bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future .
1 Even though this was a disaster in the box office , It is my favorite film . It gives a powerful message of family . It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis . Compared to other bollywood films , the action scenes in this movie are more realistic . It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan . If you want to see the Indian Godfather , Amitabh portrays that in this film . Do n't read reviews by critic , they 're just ignorant . This movie has good mix of comedy , romance , drama , and especially action . So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na(still good movie ) , this is the movie .
1 A movie made for contemporary audience . The masses get to see what they want to see . Action , comedy , drama and of course sensuous scenes as well . This is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family . It is n't for eyes of children . I had to fast forward quite a number of scenes.<br /><br />If it is just entertainment you are looking for , then this movie has it all . The songs are catchy . A lavish production , I must add.<br /><br />However , the message of the movie is not universal . It emphasizes on the idea of karma . That is , if you do good , you will get good . And if you do evil , you will get evil . The fruit of good deeds is good , while the fruit of evil is evil . < br /><br />In real life , this is not always true . It is well - known that most people do not get justice in this world . While it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end , there are many who escape . And then , there are many people who do good , and yet in return they meet with a sorry end.<br /><br />If you do n't care about the message , and all you want is an escape from worldly reality , this movie is an entertainer alright .
1 Family is about two families who are after each other 's blood.<br /><br />Viren Sahay ( Amitabh Bachchan ) is an underworld don , operates from Bangkok . He has a family in India . Once by mistake he kills Shekhar ( Akshay Kumar ) . Like Viren Sahay , he also has a family ( a brother , wife and parents ) . Aryan ( Aryaman ) , Shekhar 's brother is out to take revenge of his brother 's death . He kidnaps Viren Sahay 's family for the same reason.<br /><br />The film has got one turning point ( Amitabh Bachchan ) . Second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs , expression matters more . Akshay 's minuscule role has also put him at par with Amitabh . I did n't understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie.<br /><br />There were a few loose points in the script ; like ; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot - free in the city . Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague . How can the family of such a big don does n't have any security cover ?
1 I have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say . Even though this movie did not get the best comments , this movie made my day . It got me thinking . What a false world this is.<br /><br />What do you do when your most loved ones deceive you . It 's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake , it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance . Same way some people are such that they are never grateful . This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself . < br /><br />A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster . The surviving brother decides to take revenge . Through this process , we learn about the futility of this world . Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone.<br /><br />Amitabh gave the performance of his life . The new actor Aryan gave a good performance . The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show . Her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance . Chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself.<br /><br />A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi . His movies always give some message to the audience . His movies are like novels of Nanak Singh ( a Punjabi novelist who 's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil ) because they have a real message for the audience . They are entertaining as well as lesson - giving .
1 Gypo Nolan ( Victor McLaglen ) is as poor as anyone on Earth . Living in 1920s Ireland , Gypo and his fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive Brits . One particular rebel , wanted for murder by the English , arrives back into town secretly . He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo , but the £ 20 reward proves too tempting . Gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness . Meanwhile , the other Irish rebels are searching for the informer . Right away , Gypo , with money burning a hole in his pocket , is their main suspect , but they , who are his friends , do n't want to believe it . The story of The Informer is simple in its plot , but complex in its moral and emotional issues . It 's easily one of John Ford 's most emotionally involving films . What Gypo did was wrong , but we can certainly understand his motives . We also understand his sorry character , and there 's a lot of sympathy that arises for him . The script is very suspenseful , as well . It 's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up , so we have to grit our teeth and bear along with it . The acting is remarkable . Victor McLaglen , who acted in many of Ford 's films , probably gave his best performance here ( and won an Oscar for it ) . Every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos . In addition to an amazing script and acting , The Informer is one of John Ford 's most expressionistic films . I love the darker side of Ford . In its mood , as well as in its themes , The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford films , The Long Voyage Home ( 1940 ) and The Fugitive ( 1948 ) ; it 's also a bit similar to The Grapes of Wrath ( 1940 ) in these respects . 10/10 .
1 A brilliant portrait of a traitor ( Victor McLaglen in Oscar winning performance ) who is hounded by his own conscience . McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during Ireland 's Sinn Fein Rebellion . The scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic , focusing on the desperation within individuals . The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death.<br /><br />Director John Ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere , enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the Irish landscape . Max Steiner 's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight . Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay , nominated for Best Picture . This is one of Hollywood 's Classic .
1 Magnificent and unforgettable , stunningly atmospheric , and brilliantly acted by all.<br /><br />I really can not understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 ( and nine ones!)<br /><br />This , along with Grapes of Wrath , is John Ford 's greatest movie . I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line , though quite a way back.<br /><br />Rating : 10 . It deserves a 12 .
1 This film deals with the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man 's life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences . Watching the film , I got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates , do it again and it , sadly , would still fit contemporary events . But te remake would n't be nearly as good . A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen ( for which he deservedly got an Oscar ) and a fine ensemble cast that includes most , if not all the actors with brogues in Hollywood at the time , most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out . A very good film well worth watching . Highly recommended .
1 I do n't doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable , Charles Laughton , and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race . But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford would n't have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it was n't . No split involved in his award.<br /><br />The movie and the story by Liam O'Flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army . He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in . He 's down to his last pence and if he ca n't get back in , wants enough for passage to America . There 's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford . In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip.<br /><br />The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and they 're pretty certain it was McLaglen . He has n't the wit to really cover his own tracks . He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek . He also picks up a hanger - on played by J.M. Kerrigan.<br /><br />The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning . Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows , making it possibly the first noir thriller . Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic , like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.<br /><br />John Ford knew this world very well . He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA . His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan.<br /><br />Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher . In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here . My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest . He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.<br /><br />The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film . When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court , Meek ai n't in a position to say no . The King 's justice and writ does not run here . It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary , the British are indeed losing their grip on the population.<br /><br />Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches , but rather fewer than you would expect . Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree , the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.<br /><br />The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time .
1 Victor McLaglen , the title character of John Ford 's THE INFORMER , reminded me of the circus man from Fellini 's LA STRADA . Anthony Quinn played the brutish man , who may have even been influenced by the pug - faced , Oscar - winning performance given by McLaglen . Poverty - stricken Dublin is the true - life , atmospheric setting of the picture , which takes place in 1922 . Dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep Irish patriotism and the fight of the Irish Republican Army . The conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes THE INFORMER tick . McLaglen 's large , simple character just wants to go to America and we 're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently . Two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken Irishman . One is the previous , the other a WANTED sign . Should he do it and get the money to go?<br /><br />John Ford once famously said , " My name is Ford . I make Westerns . " After seeing this film , he obviously could do a heck of a lot more . The serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about . And the look of the piece is amazing , consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable Ireland night . Ford was always known for his luminescent , gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters . This is hard in color , but he did it in pictures like THE SEARCHERS , painting John Wayne in a sometimes vicious manner . Victor McLaglen 's performance not only benefits from the lighting , but by the sheer simplicity of his acting . He shoves a lot . He knocks people out . He is a brute who knows no better . He should , however , know whether or not to cross the IRA.<br /><br />See the film to find out the gritty details . See it also for McLaglen and Ford 's patriotic portrayal of the IRA . Max Steiner 's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters , placing more emphasis on them . This was usually only seen in silent films , especially Chaplin . The topic of naming names or " informing " is obviously still important . Just look at how the media covered this year 's Oscars , giving much attention to the Elia Kazan scandal .
1 To watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith , as one has to keep saying to oneself , " it 's old " , " it 's a classic " , " be kind " , not because the movie is so bad , but because at its best it 's so good . This is one dated movie . It 's also a classic , if a tarnished one . I 'm not inclined to laugh at people anyway , on principle , and I get more than a little irritated when others do so . To make fun of The Informer to my mind is a little like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth . Yes , one says to oneself , he is an idiot , and yet when he 's on top of his game he is also a true savant . The same is true for The Informer , which is on occasion very dreadful indeed , and yet it boasts splendid photography , some fine acting , a wonderful score and a good , decent simple story . In the end , which I wo n't give away , politics , religion and psychology come together , in a church , in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top , and yet so is life sometimes . Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us ( presumably brilliant ) modern folks , and the scene is n't so much unbelievable ( I buy it , but I know the Irish ) as embarrassing . Yet people do behave that way , they do say things like that . Not everyone is hip , and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip . Are people today so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago ? And in what way ? I do n't think so . We 're just different . Now go watch the movie .
1 Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be " Who ? " or perhaps " Why ? " Well , believe it or not , Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film , which is about a poor , desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for " carfare " to the United States . It 's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well - meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks . The movie takes place in British - dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland , all Mr. McLaglen 's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk . The movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point , many others not only do not care , they do n't even know what the fuss is all about . The morale of this movie is : look out for the friend , he may sell you out for a dime .
1 One of John Ford 's best films ' The Informer ' does n't feature any grand scenery of the American West . Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen 's face . The former prizefighter , who once faced Joe Louis in the ring , delivers an Academy Award - winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life.<br /><br />The plot is gracefully simple : In 1922 Dublin , a starving and humiliated man who 's been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood , himself becomes an informant . For £ 20 he betrays a friend to " the Tans " and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt , denial , self - pity , and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions . < br /><br />It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the film 's most impressive achievement . In most movies a burly lout of Gypo 's type would be cast as the heavy , he 'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown . In ' The Informer ' Gypo himself is both hero and villain , while the showdown is in his inner turmoil , every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience.<br /><br />Because Liam O'Flaherty 's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 , RKO gave Ford a very modest budget . The director and his associates , particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August , turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself . In addition to McLaglen 's Oscar ' The Informer ' also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score .
1 Maybe it 's because I looked up the history of the Irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad Civil War that engulfed the Free State after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie . Anyway , the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Victor McLaglen is n't as famous today as he was back then , and he should be better remembered . In this film , I think he 's playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains . For example , the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in earlier years , when he was a world - class bare - knuckles boxer . John Ford is partly responsible for that ; the IMDb trivia section shows how he tricked McLaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene . This director also could bring out a lot in his actors , even without such tricks . Mostly , though , McLaglen is firmly in control , especially when his character is almost totally blotto ( which is difficult for an actor to do believably ) , and he also plays Gypo Nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen McLaglen later in his career , in " The Quiet Man . " I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the IRA man Denis Hogan in " Hangman 's House . " < br /><br />In " The Quiet Man , " of course , McLaglen is a country squire at odds with the local IRA . Victor McLaglen was big and bully , in the old - fashioned sense of the word , but he was a good actor , too , and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just would n't expect of a such a man today . It 's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices.<br /><br />Ford , as usual , packs a lot into a little bit of film . All the characters are excellent ( though the Commandant 's mostly American accent is distracting ) -- NOTE : There be spoilers ahead ! -- Knowing that Gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead , we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing Gypo , and the humanity he shows , most notably when they go to take Gypo in Mary 's room . < br /><br />John Ford really shows his genius here , taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of Gypo and the other characters , but of poor Ireland during that tortured time .
1 John Ford is one of the most influential and best remembered American filmmakers in the history of film , his name usually associated with the western film genre . However , John Ford 's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the Irish fight for independence in the early 1920s : 1935 's The Informer.<br /><br />Times are tough on many in Ireland and the burnt out Gypo Nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in . Gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree , has a warm heart but a short fuse , and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self - centered pig . Walking the streets starving with no where to live , the hulking Gypo Nolan finds the prime lady in his life , Katie Madden , on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the United States if he only had the 20 Pounds to pay for it . As luck would have it , his friend Frankie is back in town with a 20 Pound price over his head and Gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of Frankie 's whereabouts . Gypo , with the new 20 Pounds of blood money earned , finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the IRA invests all their resources to find Frankie 's informer.<br /><br />Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar he was awarded for this film . His brutish , stupid , and tender turns give the character dimension and McLaglen is only second to Dudley Moore 's character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film Arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk . Margot Grahame 's performance as Katie Madden is also excellent but she and McLaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress . Preston Foster is especially miscast as an IRA head , mainly because he is most obviously not Irish , and J. M. Kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film 's only poor point.<br /><br />Often overshadowed by some of Ford 's better known westerns like The Searchers or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , The Informer is easily one of John Ford 's best films - if not his very best . Beginning what would be a long career of Oscar nominations and wins for John Ford , The Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 . Ford and company 's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story . Gypo 's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps , each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed . Ford 's command of this technique was amazing to watch ; if The Informer was made 10 years later ( thus making the genre requirements ) it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film .
1 I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it . 27 years later , it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!<br /><br />This tragic story of a hard - core " behind the scenes " of the entertainment industry during the late 50 's , " Sparkle " successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun . This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield , the soundtrack carries the plot with every song . From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long - term decision - making , to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead , all three young girls , Sparkle , Sister , and Delores , represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating " Dreamgirls " on Broadway , and Mariah Carey 's " Glitter , " 25 years later . As an original audience member of both productions , I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to " Sparkle , " as well as in " Saturday Night Fever , " " Fame , " " Flashdance , " and the off - Broadway smash hit " Mama , I Want To Sing . "
1 An excellent movie . Superb acting by Mary Alice , Phillip M. Thomas , and a young Irene Cara . Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin . This movie was one of the last predominately " all black " movies of the 70 's and unlike the " blaxploitation " movies of that era , this movie actually had a plot , and was very well done . The movie soundtrack , sung by Aretha Franklin , was popular on the R&B charts at the time .
1 A remarkable example of cinematic alchemy at work , with a trite'n'turgid lump of lead script ( penned by numbingly mediocre Hollywood hack nonpareil Jole Schumacher , no less ) being magically converted into a choice chunk of exquisitely gleaming 24-carat musical drama gold thanks to brisk direction , fresh , engaging performances , spot - on production values , a flavorsome recreation of 50 's era New York , an infectiously effervescent roll - with - the - punches tone , and a truly wondrous rhythm and blues score by the great Curtis Mayfield.<br /><br />The story , loosely based on the real life exploits of the Supremes , prosaically documents the arduous rags - to - riches climb of three bright - eyed , impoverished black teenage girl singers who desperately yearn to escape their ratty , unrewarding ghetto plight and make it big in the razzle - dazzle world of commercial R&B music . All the obvious pratfalls of instant wealth and success -- egos run destructively amok , drugs , corruption , fighting to retain your integrity , and so on -- are predictably paraded forth , but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film 's other departments almost completely cancels out Schumacher 's flat , uninspired plotting . The first - rate acting helps out a lot . Irene Cara , Lonette McKee , and Dwan Smith are sensationally sexy , vibrant and appealing leads -- and great singers to boot . Comparably fine performances are also turned in by a charmingly boyish pre-"Miami Vice " Philip Michael Thomas as the group 's patient , gentlemanly manager , Dorian Harewood as McKee 's venal , aggressively amorous hound dog boyfriend , and perennial blaxploitation baddie Tony ( " Hell Up in Harlem , " " Bucktown " ) King as a dangerously seductive , smooth operating , stone cold nasty gangster . The tone dips and dovetails from funny and poignant to melancholy and blithesome without ever skipping a beat , deftly evolving into a glowing , uplifting ode to the human spirit 's extraordinary ability to effectively surmount extremely difficult and intimidating odds.<br /><br />Veteran editor Sam O'Stern acquits himself superbly in his directorial debut . Bruce Surtees ' luminescent cinematography and Gordon Scott 's expert editing are both flawless . O'Stern 's firm grasp of period atmosphere , keen eye for tiny , but telling little details , and unerring sense of busy , unbroken pace are just as impressive . No fooling about Curtis Mayfield 's impeccable soundtrack contributions , either . " Jump , " " What Can I Do With This Feeling , " " Givin ' Up , " " Take My Hand Precious Lord , " " Lovin' You Baby , " and " Look Into Your Heart " are all terrifically tuneful , soulful , almost unbelievably fantastic songs , with the sweetly sultry love jones number " Something He Can Feel , " which was later covered by both Aretha Franklin and En Vogue , clearly copping top musical honors as the best - ever song in the entire movie . The net result of all these above cited outstanding attributes persuasively illustrates that sometimes it 's not the screenplay so much as what 's done with said script which in turn determines a film 's overall sterling quality .
1 I watched this movie every chance I got , back in the Seventies when it came out on cable . It was my introduction to Harlem , which has fascinated me ( and Bill Clinton ) ever since . I was still very young , and the movie made a big impression on me . It was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up , trying to decide whom they wanted to be , and making some bad choices as well as good ones . I was dazzled by Lonette McKee 's beauty , the great dresses they eventually got to wear , and the snappy dialogue . As someone being raised by a single mother as well , I could really identify with these girls and their lives . It 's funny , these characters seem almost more real to me than Beyonce Knowles !
1 Standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points . Number one , Lonette McKee as Sister who gives a stunning , star making performance . The fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me . Sadly , she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on Irena Carter 's bland character , Sparkle , whose rise to fame is easy , boring , and unconvincing . However , whenever the girls go on stage and perform , the movie comes back to life . The original music by Curis Mayfield must be praised . The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape . The picture quality was pretty low , as well as the production values I 'm guessing . All in all , its worth a gander .
1 The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group . In their endeavors , the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin , whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the " big time " who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life . Though he could be accused of killing her , he really kills only her spirit and will to live , after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose . The story is n't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off , then threatens him , it 's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be " discovered " back then .
1 First of all , I think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this . Obviously you have no taste and you do n't respect the taste of others . Not to give you a history lesson but I think it needs to be done . Black actors out there are just , if not more , successful as others . If you are not a part of the " Black " race you can not understand the quality , creativeness , and vibrant of old movies such as " Sparkle " and " Mahogany " and " Cooley High . " Since unfortunately you are not Black , you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics , so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non - dancing race . Thanks .
1 The Life and Time of Little Richard , as told by Little Richard , as produced and directed by Little Richard , was about as one sided as one of his songs . This is not a biography or even a docudrama , but does have good writing , great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing Richard . All the music is by Little Richard , so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song.<br /><br />The movie covers his early childhood , carrys thru the formative years in music , the wild success and Richard 's throwing it all away to praise the Lord . Its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles , whom opened for him.<br /><br />My main objection is that his outrageous , counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time . Some of his energy , which he still has , does not come across full force . He seemed tame , compared to what I remember of him at the time.<br /><br />The best scenes are Richard getting jilted by Lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing , to make the point about not having a decent place to change.<br /><br />If they had gotten into the " Bronze Liberace " as Richard use to refer to himself in interviews , then there 's a story . Trust me I just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys , giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience , his headband . Nearly 68 and still going strong I recommend this movie and any concert or T.V. appearance you can find . Little Richard is always on
1 I really liked this movie , it was good , and the actors were brilliant ! Leon Robinson , who played Richard , and many other classic singers , is very good at his job , when you see him in a musical movie , you know that it is going to be good ! I would suggest that people watch this heart warming , sad , and special movie , if they want to know more about Richard ! Outstanding ! Fresh !
1 Leon was fantastic as always , this time playing Little Richard in his early years . The movie showed a fully fleshed out Little Richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music . My only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt - I was hoping for a 2-parter !
1 It is always a nice suprise when a film made for TV turns out to be entertaining such as Little Richard . This is a very watchable film about the story of Rock and Roller , Little Richard played by an actor called Leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job . As most TV films , this is a little tamer than if made for Cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about Little Richard that was controversial . Instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career . All in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a TV film . 7 out of 10 .
1 It is fitting on a musical Sunday to get your heart a pumping , and no one can do that better than Little Richard . The man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll.<br /><br />Look to Leon to provide a definitive characterization , as he has done so with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock ' n ' Roll : The Alan Freed Story.<br /><br />This was a fascinating biopic as we saw Little Richard struggle with his father , with his church and with himself over just who he was . He won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style .
1 Tressa 's vocal performance was Outstanding ! ! Tressa played the female singer role , while Richard was in the club . When she first step out on stage , and started to riff and strut her stuff , it made my soul shake . Her voice is platinum . She needs to make a CD . She has more fans then she realizes . I loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beats , which she also starred with Leon when she was younger . How can a little girl have a voice so big . She is truly amazing . Good voice Good Good Good Good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice , back shaking , tear crying , uplifting , take you back in the days voice . Tressa if you read this commit , please take my advice and start recording a CD . If not just for the love of singing , but for your fans . I believe you can truly make it . Look at these other one hit single studio singers , lol .
1 Actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon . He captures Little Richard to a most believable essence . The outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie . Although the movie is a little long , it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of Little Richard in mind . The ending should have taken a direction of moving Little Richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium . He will always be the King of Rock - N - Roll as far as I am concerned regardless of what the other media says .
1 I truly enjoyed the movie , however , I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life . First of all I was not aware of Lucille . There is very little ( hardly any ) mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard . Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way . I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned . Overall the movie was great . I also did not like Leon playing the part of Little Richard , he is a good actor but I feel that the part of should have went to a different actor . Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard . I also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of . From the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict . In todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition . He was a voyeur . I do n't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that I feel should not have been a part of the final cut .
1 I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother . We had been drinking . This is one of the best films for ripping apart I have ever seen . From the ' luxury ' ocean liner actually being a ' roll on , roll off ' ferry , complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff , then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks ! ! The continuity is so poor you ca nt help but notice it , it slaps you in the face with the holes . In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance . Cut to his son and new girlfriend ( The ships PR director who knows kung - fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion . ...... Then the dad is there hugging them . HoW ? ? ? ? Who cares , its magic . There is not one redeeming feature to this film . The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table . when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide , you 've guessed it . Enter the villains who , instead of checking under the One table , proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar ( a corner bar in the casino - fantastic ) . They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and ' take them out'.<br /><br />Get some mates over , get a few drinks in , put this film on and howl .
1 This film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage . Straight from Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wisecracks , shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it ca n't help but amuse and entertain . There are tanks , helicopters , machine gun battles , grenades and ice cream vans and if they are n't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one ... Danny Trejo . And if you do n't know who Danny Trejo is then you probably wo n't like this film .
1 Guns blasting , buildings exploding , cars crashing , and that 's just the first ten minutes . < br /><br />This action - packed film involving a rogue ex - CIA mercenary who ca n't seem to die no matter how many times he 's shot ( hence the title ) is pretty decent . < br /><br />Tough and toothy Gary Busey , usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks , has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued : after all he 's carrying the entire show . Which does n't mean there is n't a lot of terrific supporting roles including William Smith , Luke Askew , Mills Watson , R.G. Armstrong , Henry Silva , Lincoln Kirkpatrick , Thalmus Rasulala , and several other " forgotten " character - actors . < br /><br />There 's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story : Busey has to free a group of " kidnapped " American military elites and return a high - tech " supertank " ( a normal tank with a cheesy add - on pasted to the top ) back to the States . < br /><br />But does America deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys ? This question is asked , of course , like in any film centering on the CIA ... but without getting preachy .
1 Gary Busey is the title character , Frank " Bulletproof " McBain , your standard - issue reckless maverick cop who 's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes ( 38 and counting ) , he never stops going after the bad guys.<br /><br />When a cutting - edge U.S. tank dubbed " Thunderblast " is driven across the border into Mexico , it 's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado ( Rene Enriquez ) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff ( Henry Silva ) , who 's aligned himself with Russian villains . The Army personnel involved are kept as prisoners , chief among them Devon Shepard ( Darlanne Fluegel ) , who happens to be McBain 's ex - girlfriend . McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission.<br /><br />Busey may not have the physical presence of say , someone like Schwarzenegger , who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type , but he 's a blast as a self- confident dude who 's quick with the wisecracks . Fluegel is a great female lead ; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt - kicking action babe . Enriquez , Silva , Juan Fernandez , and the always welcome William Smith ( as a Russian major ) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition . The supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors : L.Q. Jones , R.G. Armstrong , Thalmus Rasulala , Lincoln Kilpatrick , Mills Watson , Luke Askew , Danny Trejo , and Cary - Hiroyuki Tagawa.<br /><br />T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman supply the script , based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray . It 's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks : they know their material is absurd and cheesy , and just have fun throwing credibility out the window . Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire , explosions , and general all - out mayhem.<br /><br />"Bulletproof " is good fun for the action fan who does n't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor.<br /><br />7/10
1 Its no surprise that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity , this film is also a poor decision , but one I enjoyed fully . The first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film ; boring , bad dialouge , and then , with a Spiderman stance , Busey yells the best - worst line in any film ever created ... "your worst nightmare butthorn ! " I coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard . That line resonates so well , it even tops Clooney 's infamous " hi Freeze , I 'm Batman " line . Other classic moments is Busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex - CIA partner killed ... which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest ( all made possible by a super slow - motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting ) . There 's an ashtray to the nads , punches to the face , and a " that was n't my fault and you know it ! " Well , the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy , so ... Other scream out - loud moments has to be his ex girl - friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape -- a plan that defies all logic , physics , and absurdity . And lastly , when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object , I almost wet myself . Some of Busey 's best work by far , rent or buy it today " butthorn ! " My vote is a perfect 10 ( on the poo meter that is ) .
1 When the scientist and family man Matt Winslow ( Robert Urich ) finally accepts the invitation to work the Micro - Digitech Corporation in a space suit project , he moves with his beloved wife Patricia ( Joanna Cassidy ) and their son Robbie ( Barret Oliver ) and daughter Chrissy ( Soleil Moon Frye ) to a huge modern house in the corporation compound . They meet their friend Tom Peterson ( Joe Regalbuto ) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle , and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club . Tom tries to seduce Matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in Micro - Digitech , but Matt is not tempted with the offer . Later he is introduced to the director of the club , Jessica Jones ( Susan Lucci ) that befriends Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children . Matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club , finding an evil secret about Jessica and the members.<br /><br />In the 80 's , when I saw " Invitation to Hell " , I liked this movie that partially recalls " The Stepford Wives " , with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound . I have just seen it today , and I found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations , when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries . I am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story , but I believe it fits perfectly . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Convite Para o Inferno " ( " Invitation to Hell " )
1 Better than the typical made - for - tv movie , INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with excellent casting ( Urich , Lucci , Cassidy , McCarthy , pre - Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto , Soleil Moon - Frye ) and a high concept update to the familiar Faustian plot . Urich is likable as always and Lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles . Kind of a hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE , the movie commits early to its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy , maudlin denoument . 7/10
1 A classy film pulled in 2 directions . To its advantage it is directed by Wes Craven . On the downside the TV film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget . It moves along as Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club . His latest invention , a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood . Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci . Her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later . The actor , scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film . Lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called Catherine . Lucci and Barbara Steele 's portrait in ' Black Sunday ' were used as references for the Catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by Armourae . Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine . So by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film .
1 Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family moves in , as the father have got a new job in a computer company there . But no paradise would be complete without its snake . Strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband , as it certainly holds secrets . The father is not a joiner , but pressure is on him to join , as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members . Robert Urich 's good guy part is a bit tepid , but Joanna Cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles . Suspenseful and well - made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chairperson . Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit part as a valet . The movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for . I have seen this movie quite a few times .
1 Robert Urich was a fine actor , and he makes this TV movie believable . I remember watching this film when I was 15 , and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club , in a computer rich Californian town . Urich try 's to figure out what is wrong with his family , and I love the Halloween space suit idea , brilliant . This film is about the battle of one 's sprit . TV quality , that exceeds , the big budget , Gangs of New York . I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ? I hope so ! 6 or 7 out of 10 .
1 This Movie has great fight scenes . Now its true that the acting is a little rough . But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty . But If you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with Amazing stunts WITHOUT the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix . Then Watch this . Now it 's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie . But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p**s his pants . And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit threw and admire .
1 As a 90 minute experience , it is not up to the standard of ` Drive ' , as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the ` Who Am I ? ' academy , while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb Mark Dacascos beat ' em - up . However , those who enjoyed ` Drive ' , ( and I thought it was wonderful ! ) , will undoubtedly enjoy this too . You certainly wo n't rewind back to the start and watch it all again , but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come.<br /><br / > It is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced , even if not in Hong Kong , and I would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets , time and respect afforded to the likes of Yuen Woo - ping and Corey Yuen Kuei . If you sit through the first half hour and are n't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat . Bosch is magnificent , and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics , kicks and simple acts of bravery.<br /><br / > If you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy , then track it down and watch it . It 's not Shakespeare . In fact , it 's less articulate than Coolio in ` China Strike Force ' , but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - ( I 'm pretty sure there 's no safe way to land directly on your head , or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car!?).<br /><br / >
1 A delightful if somewhat predictable TV movie , though I admit a little bias -- as far as I 'm concered , the more Gene Wilder in this world the better . I 'd love to see numerous additional movies detailing the adventures of Larry " Cash " Carter !
1 " The Lady in Question ( 1999 ) " starring Gene Wilder is a well - acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black - and - white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series . Both Perry and " Cash " kept me guessing right up to the end . There were many suspects with a motive for the murder , but I had no idea which character it would be.<br /><br />Gene Wilder has a special charming wit about him , even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part . The portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well . I 'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off . I am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie . Even his singing was a delight . I like him in this role more than his former " sillier " roles like " The Young Frankenstein " and " Willy Wonka . " I am hoping A & E will continue this series . They ought to call it something like " The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries." < br /><br />The music fit the period . I enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes . I was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period . And I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script . To me , that always distracts.<br /><br />Overall , my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well - crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites : Raymond Burr 's Perry Mason .
1 This is just one more example of the absolute genius of Gene Wilder . He wrote and starred in this terrific mystery . No one could have done it better . The suspense was palpable throughout . I wish Mr. Wilder would grace us with another of these . I have enjoyed everything I have ever seen Mr. Wilder in but I had no idea how truly talented he was until I saw " Murder in a Small Town , " and this follow - on . He truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and , of course , in his brilliant acting . His subtle wit comes through in spades . I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and/or Gene Wilder 's film work . His star just gets brighter and brighter .
1 Pleasant , diverting and charming . The best part is the swing numbers , especially the rendition of My Buddy , partial though it may have been . The acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by Wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film .
1 Good sequel to Murder in a Small Town . In this one Cash and his police Lt . buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal , a philanthropic witch , and a family of screw - ups and their wierdo helpers . As in the original , the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre - war America . Go see it .
1 Kim ( Patricia Clarkson ) , George ( Jake Weber ) and son Miles ( Erik Per Sullivan ) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan 's bustling metropolis . On the way , they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow . A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along . Rather than helping , at least one of the hunters , Otis ( John Speredakos ) , is mad because the accident cracked the buck 's antlers . George , Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis , and even worse , we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they 're staying . Meanwhile , Miles is given a wendigo ( a kind of Indian shape - shifting spirit / monster ) token by an Indian whom only he has seen . Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes ? Are there wendigos in the woods ? < br /><br />I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers . It is a fairly low budget film , with technical limitations frequently showing through . Much of the film , and maybe all of it , is not really about the titular creature . And perhaps the fatal blow for many people , it has a very ambiguous ending , with a number of questions left unanswered . If you are discouraged by such endings , and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant , do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.<br /><br />Personally , I like films like that . I usually prefer some ambiguity . The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick , scary creature flick , where they 'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end , and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2 : The Monster Returns , but that 's not what this film is . Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people . Heck , writer / director Larry Fessenden even has a character , George , reciting Robert Frost . The Frost poem , and George 's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things , is the key to the film.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is its complexity . In a way , there are four different films occurring at the same time , a thread from each character . In George 's thread , he is n't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world , and he has some parenting problems . For him , the film is a realistic , horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse . In Patricia 's thread , she 's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family . She 's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her , hoping that they 'll go away and get better . In Otis ' thread , he 's even more down on his luck than George , and George 's arrival into his life symbolizes the final " crack " in his psychological armor . And in Miles ' thread , which is probably the most important of the film , life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world . But this is a horror story , after all , albeit one with a glimmer of hope , and the events in the film give Miles ' poetic interpretations a dark turn . Still , when everything is said and done , he seems to be the only one retaining his composure , due to the poetic outlook.<br /><br />Even though the film is low budget , there are a lot of well - executed higher budget ambitions . Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations , and created some interesting slide show like montages ( such as the cards , or the Indian wendigo images from the book ) . There are also interesting more traditional montages , such as Miles ' nightmare . Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.<br /><br />Other technical aspects are good for the budget . The " Wendigo " appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous . The lighting was usually good -- there were a few times that dark scenes were n't as clear as they could have been , but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock ( it could have been digital instead ) or transfer . I thought the performances were good and far more realistic ( if you value that ) than the majority of films . Although I did n't really notice the score , it must have been okay , or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.<br /><br />Overall , Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions , as long as you do n't mind having to think about the movies you watch .
1 Larry Fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum . Well , the worst mistake , evidently , is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted . Obviously , this is not a true horror movie , at least , not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying . < br /><br />"Wendigo " is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles . Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they ca n't comprehend . It is obvious that Kim , the mother , is a psychologist , but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son . This is also a story of alienation . It 's clear that the father , George , is a distant figure , perhaps a workaholic , who seems to be living in a different world.<br /><br />Miles ' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country . That part of New York state , with its winter landscape , barren trees , play havoc on the little boy 's imagination . It does n't help that he encounters a strange figure in town , it creates even more doubts in his young mind . Ultimately , Miles ' world comes crashing down on him and he ca n't do anything , even evoking the Wendigo spirit.<br /><br />The film is well paced and acted . Patricia Clarkson is excellent , no matter where movie she is in . Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he does n't understand . Erik Per Sullivan , as Miles , conveys the inner turmoil within him . I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what 's going on around him . Finally , John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis , a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.<br /><br />Instead of putting this movie down , future viewers should approach it with a open mind .
1 If you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore , tons of jump - scare moments and unrelenting , escalating scenes of excruciating death , then look elsewhere . If you like quiet , moody , thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread , then Wendigo is for you.<br /><br />Thoughtful , stressed out George , his psychoanalyst wife Kim and their young son Miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city . On the way up , George hits a stag with his car . The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase . In particular , deranged hunter Otis takes it personally . He follows the family to their vacation home , making sure they see him . He spies on George and Kim as they have sex . He fires through their windows with his rifle when they are n't home , letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return . When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town , Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case , carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag . A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo , a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry . Miles takes the figure home with him , already haunted by the death of the deer the day before . That afternoon , when he and his father go sledding , George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed ... or is he just in shock , and imagining the whole thing ? Hours later , George is rushed to the hospital and Miles , still clutching his statue , either faints , dreams or goes on a vision quest , in which the Wendigo returns . This time the angry , flesh eating god - part tree , part stag and part man - is hunting for Otis , who has finally gone over the edge.<br /><br />Wendigo is a beautifully made film , almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees . Okay , so the monster itself is kind of fakey - looking , but it 's a small flaw , more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film , and the eerie backdrop of the silent , snowy countryside . The performances are great , particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but no - nonsense wife . They are a happy couple with their share of common problems , and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful . Watching this film is often like watching someone 's home videos , so realistic are the performances . < br /><br />This movie is not for everyone . A lot of people may find themselves totally bored , waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come . We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists , seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also , later , through the eyes of a madman . This is more a psychological drama than a horror film , but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror .
1 This is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word ' horror ' in order for it to be appreciated . The main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and , as with most younger children , he gets frightened easily . Mainly because he simply does n't understand things , like why his father is hardly ever there for him . From watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it , but the little boy does n't . Also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods , as it is established early on in the film , that the family is from the city . Also , in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer , then get held up , then they argue with the locals about it , and the little boy surely did n't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all.<br /><br />The " Wendigo " is ultimately what his young , innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this . There is the American Indian legend , but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it , it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically . Not because that 's what the Wendigo actually is , but because that is how he understands it . When you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it . Obviously it was low - budget and shot cheaply , but the jumping montages , use of light , and general eeriness more than make up for it . And the final question the film asks is : is it all in your head , or is it really out there ? 8/10<br /><br />Rated R : profanity , violence , and a sex scene
1 A solid B movie.<br /><br />I like Jake Weber . His understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances . I liked the relationship between the father and son . I liked the family dynamics . The Wendigo looks silly , but it is a representation of the kid 's toy and the dead deer . It 's an amalgamation like , see ? This is a psychological story , not a Freddy slash em up instant gratification flick . Watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you 'll be fine.<br /><br />Nice work .
1 * * POSSIBLE SPOILERS**<br /><br />The biggest part of the movie that does n't work IS the Wendigo , and when your title character fails , your movie usually is n't far behind it . The filmmakers ' interpretation of the Wendigo 's form is interesting , and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror , for instance - and the tree - form was actually very good . However , as a monster character it never really comes to life . We do n't get much of an explanation for its behavior , and what we DO see from it does n't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself , or any Wendigo lore I 've ever read.<br /><br />I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it is n't given enough to do , in the movie . When you boil this film down to its bones , what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element , instead of a movie about a monster.<br /><br />The cinematography is good , though a little cheesy ; the filmmakers use scenery , lighting , and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well . The character of Otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable , making him the real monster in the film . It might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the Wendigo , which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend.<br /><br />I have heard unconfirmed reports ( from a newsgroup ) that the reason the Wendigo does n't do much is that , when the monster suit was built , it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable ( in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves , the performer had to walk on his toes ) that it was nearly impossible to run , walk , or otherwise perform in it . Thus the many flashes of the creature standing still , and the obvious sped - up footage of it running . I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed .
1 From the first scene , I was really excited . " I can tell this is going to be awesome ! " I thought . The acting was so good , I felt as though I was eaves - dropping on these peoples ' lives . The music too was exquisitely unsettling . The plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward ( one could sense ) toward some irrevocable fate . The build was slow , but I personally love that kind of thing , as long as the quiet tension stays on track and does n't get derailed before it 's ready to pay off.<br /><br />So everything 's going fine , and then the fireworks begin , and before you know it , the credits are rolling . " WHAT ? ! ! ! " was all I and my movie - night companion could say . If you understand the director 's intentions , the blunt ending does make sense ( for those of you who have seen the movie already , check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com ) , but I ca n't help saying it was not pulled off quite right.<br /><br />This probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax . In any case , it 's too bad . Those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world . ( But for those of you who do n't write or make films , you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a HUGE pain in the butt , and I am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal!)<br /><br />Wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished . But hay , I 'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over - produced piece of dog - poo over - compensated with too many digital effects ( like most horror movies these days).<br /><br />One other comment . Some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether I should be scared or laughing . I do n't know how to explain it , but there was a distinctively Monty Python feel about this monster in his more blatent " monster " forms . Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie -- I do n't know , it still worked for me in some crooked way . I will never look at deer antlers in the same way again ! :)
1 George and Kim are traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch . But what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey , where myth becomes reality and a flesh - eating spirit , half animal and half man Wendigo , haunts a small town ... "Wendigo " by Larry Fessenden is a thought - provoking horror film that often tenderfoot 's into a somber family drama . The acting is great , the characters are well - developed and there are some bone - chilling moments . The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled effectively and it 's never clear what is real and what is imagined , or even if the story is taking place entirely in Miles ' head . Overall,"Wendigo " is my first contact with Larry Fessenden 's work and surely wo n't be the last . Give this film a chance , if you do n't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10 .
1 This film is more about how children make sense of the world around them , and how they ( and we ) use myth to make sense of it all . I think it 's been misperceived , everyone going in expecting a stalkfest wo n't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story , it 's here .......
1 If you want Scream or anything like the big - studio horror product that we get forced on us these days do n't bother . This well - written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say . Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense , how children interpret the world ( and the violence in it ) , our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends .. all here , but not flatly on the surface . You could technically call it a " monster movie " even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end , and then it 's even up to you and your beliefs as to what 's happening with the legendary spirit / beast . Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores , though in fact the less you see of the creature , the better . Fessenden successfully continues George Romero 's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out .
1 A haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude . Keep your Freddys and your Jasons -- this film is in the same company as " The Haunting " ( the original ) . Lyrical and truthful , it stays with you long into the night , much like those terrifying CBS Radio Mystery Theatre shows . A smart rent .
1 Now this is what I 'm talking about . Finally , a low - budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage . WENDIGO , while occasionally flawed , is a triumph of the imagination . Granted , it leans heavy on EVIL DEAD style camera moves for its moodiness , but it 's still a damn sight better than 99 % of direct to video dross.<br /><br />The story is pretty simple : a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter . But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical Wendigo . Is it real ? Is it all in the boy 's imagination ? Is it an externalization of the child 's emotional state ? < br /><br />Some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it 's left to you to decide . Do n't be put off by such petty nonsense . A film that makes you think is not one to avoid . It 's one to rejoice in .
1 Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller , the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes . The acting is good , the characters act like a normal family . The Wendigo effects are good , the Deer Form reminded me a little of the Rabbit in Donnie Darko.<br /><br />The film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer , a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named Otis starts to argue with the Dad George , after the car is lifted they drive off to the house . The Son Miles is a little shook up about the Deer but his Parents try to tell him that it 's natural for things like that to happen . That night while he 's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom , the next day they go into to town and Miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the Wendigo , when Miles shows Kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there . Once returning home George takes his son sledding and while there sledding he 's knocked off the board and Miles is chases by the wind , after gaining conciseness they go looking for George , they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot , in the Hospital Kim tells the Sheriff that Otis may have shot him , the Shrieff goes to Otis 's place where he 's bashed over the head with a hammer , as Otis drives down the road he finds that the Wendigo is after him.<br /><br />Wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments . Check this out . 10/10
1 This movie is excellent . I found it very interesting . I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool . The acting was also great , as well as the costumes , production , photography , directing and script . < br /><br />A very happy family , on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer . A huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer 's antler 's is broken . He then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them . < br /><br />See this movie . It 's worth it . Kudos to the cast , crew and filmmakers . Two Thumbs Way Up !

1 A family ( mother - Patricia Clarkson , father - Jake Weber , son - Erik Per Sullivan ) go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter . They accidentally hit a deer while driving there . This angers some of the locals -- especially Otis ( John Speredakos ) and things slowly ( VERY slowly ) go wrong.<br /><br />I was expecting the worst when I started watching this . The bulk of the reviews for this , on this site , are extremely negative . Well ... I disagree . First off it 's NOT a horror film . The horror does n't even begin until the closing 30 minutes . It plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in . On that level , it 's pretty damn good.<br /><br />First -- the bad stuff : The pace is WAY too slow ; Jake Weber is a horrible actor ; WAY too many false dream sequence scares ; the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable.<br /><br />The good stuff : Pretty good dramatic script ; Clarkson is excellent as the mother ; some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary ; a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber ( which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot ! ) ; pretty good acting by Sullivan ( only 10 at the time ! ) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending.<br /><br />I think many people are annoyed with this film because it 's being pushed as a horror film -- which it is n't . So , if you can ignore that , I think you might like it . I 'm giving it a 7 .
1 One of the biggest hits of 1926 , Brown of Harvard is a exciting comedy / drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a major star . It 's patented Haines all the way : brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl . No one worked this formula like Haines . A terrific comic actor ( Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford , Show People with Marion Davies ) , Haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression . He is a total joy in this film as he was in Tell It to the Marines ( with Lon Chaney ) and West Point ( with Joan Crawford ) , where he repeats the formula . Mary Brian is good as the girl , Jack Pickford is very good as the sickly roommate , Ralph Bushman is the rival . Edward Connelly , Mary Alden , David Torrence , Guinn Williams , and Grady Sutton co - star . This film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for being John Wayne 's film debut as a Yale football player ( but I never spotted him ) . Haines was a top - five box office star starting with this picture through 1932 . It 's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost . He was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time .
1 This is an extraordinary film , that tricks you constantly . It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points , and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles . It would give away too much to say much more , but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded . William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re - discovered . The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford 's chest ( Pickford has a cold ) . Both actors play this sub - text subtlely and with great depth of emotion , so that there are moments that are very moving . And I never thought I could get so involved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I do n't even understand the rules ! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman 's son Ralph as Haines ' rival for the girl ( yes , it 's not completely a gay movie ) . Wonderful silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with an edge .
1 I 've been intrigued by this film for a while , in part because of the extremely high score here on IMDb -- a 9.0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film ! How had I not heard of this film before this website ? Well , you ca n't always trust the ratings . This is actually a very good film , preserved quite well if the fine VHS transfer I rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals , especially William Haines as Brown , and good location work at Cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic Harvard / Yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 . Obnoxious , self - centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place , becoming in the process a caring , self - sacrificing friend ; I doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels , the predictability factor is high . Still , it starts out very well , and is certainly deserving of being remembered , if not praised to the heavens . Maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /><br />EDIT Now 600 + voters and the score has actually climbed to 9.2 ! Seriously , folks , there is ballot - stuffing going on here - I defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than " Metropolis " or " The General " !
1 This is apparently the second remake of this film , having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 . And , in so many ways it reminds me of the later film , A YANK AT OXFORD . Both films concern a conceited blow - hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both , ultimately , show the blow - hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency . In this film , William Haines is " Tom Brown " and his main rival , " Bob " is played by Frances X. Bushman . And , in a supporting role is Jack Pickford -- always remembered as the brother of Mary . Of these three , Pickford comes off the best , as the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom 's pal -- he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game ! All the standard clichés are there and the movie , because it was done so many times before and since , offers few surprises . However , it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.<br /><br />In my opinion , for a better silent college film , try Harold Lloyd 's THE FRESHMAN -- it 's football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown . THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era . Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again ( such as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET , among others)--and if you 've seen one of these films , you 've seen them all . Well made , but certainly NOT original ! And , because it is just a rehash of his other films , anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920 ! ! Talk about over - rated ! There are dozens and dozens of better films -- how this film got to be # 1 is anyone 's guess .
1 Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down . We expect a lot more from our movies these days , so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20 's were a bit more innocent . William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and , even , glory . All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford , the town nerd . The movie has everything , romance , tears , love , death , and even sports ... It 's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century .
1 This , the finest achievement from Georg Wilhelm Pabst 's Social Realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at Courrieres in northern France took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks , eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities . Estimable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy , providing a perception of reality , augmented by matchless sound editing , with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director 's fascinating visual compositions . Pabst 's manner of " invisible editing " that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles , enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting . Although the work 's cardinal theme relates to Socialist dogma , the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details , born of Pabst 's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for German rescue squads of whom their Fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of French victims ; certainly , a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release .
1 The name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about , so I taped this film during the early hours of the AM . If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men . This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after WW I and how the Germans came to the aid of the French miners much to the unbelief of the French townsfolk . The actors were all outstanding , with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine . There is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down . If you are a real film buff , this is a film you will not want to miss .
1 Based on an actual mining disaster , this early German talkie ( with English subtitles ) still remains one of the most effective docu - dramas ever filmed . Featuring many non - professional actors , " Kameradschaft " gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers , regardless of which side of the French / German border they may be from . A deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone , nullifying any superiors ' orders . A fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades , even at threat of great loss , including life.<br /><br />This film reminds of the self - sacrificing heroism shown by the NYFD following the 9/11 attacks . Putting aside any formal rules and regulations , these men and women in uniform knew only one cause : to save lives , and to find their fellow - fire fighters . -- More than 70 years later , " Kameradschaft " still has the strong and timeless message : A friend in need is a friend in deed .
1 This film , along with WESTFRONT 1918 , are my favorite Pabst - directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks ( such as PANDORA 'S BOX ) . It 's probably because both are very similar to the Neo - Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s . This style film called for using non - actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case , the film is about French and German coal miners , so appropriately , the people in the roles seem like miners -- not actors . The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco - German border . Instead of one big mine , it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine , despite there being greater unemployment in Germany . This , language differences ( illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene ) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions -- resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality . Later , an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing . Risking their own lives , they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried , in vain , to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred . It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen . Considering history , though , the film 's impact was minimal at best . It 's a real shame , as like this one , WESTFRONT 1918 , JÁACCUSE ( Gance ) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT ( Milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion . So , from a historical point of view , it 's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing .
1 Valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director 's distaste for war . The audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but , we learn that Europeans at the interval between WWI and WWII , had concerning pacifists(for lack of a better term ) . The speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film , are inspiring given the time . Although the revised edition , through the transfer technology of early foreign films , " cuts - off characters heads " at times , this film holds it 's own in many different aspects . Character analysis , lighting techniques , historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker.<br /><br />Pabst went on to Direct and put to screen Weil & Brecht 's " Three Penny Opera " , starring the original star , Lotte Lenya .
1 Sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting , emotional man - helping - man plea , in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed off from each other after the Great War thanks to a new border , leading to disillusionment on the German side , as the French are the bosses . But when a fire begins on the French side , the common decency of the German men lead to assistance , safety and even friendship . This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade , as a certain man from Pabst 's own side would break that piece and turn the Great War into merely a prelude . But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism , as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant , cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work . Also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions , but real people , with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well . These are ordinary , working - class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man , and in this day of individualist opportunism , I 'll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aspire to.<br /><br />(Note : Apparently the ending is cut on most prints , where the French rebuild the mining gate , closing off the men once again . This is a brutal turn of events , and may have made the film a better overall film , but I would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence , so in short , I 'm glad it was clipped . ) { Grade : 8/10 ( B ) / # 7 ( of 11 ) of 1931 }
1 Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other . It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931 . Only a few years later , Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world , France being a casualty of his ambitions . But these are times of sereneness compared to the future . A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work . They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors . Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a well - crafted and written scene , a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue . A simple story is it not ? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not , but his poetry is there to be discovered . He is n't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal . Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story . Supposedly based on a real event , the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness . Smetimes , that 's what a movie needs to be .
1 I suppose the ultimate curse of attending the Toronto Film Festival is your release date time table get messed up . Quite frankly , I 'm just happy Fido got picked up for US distribution . In any case ... <br /><br />Ever seen Shaun of the Dead ? Good . How about Lassie ? Able to reconcile the two ? Well , if you can your name might be Andrew Currie , Canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy , or zomedy . ( Seriously , that 's what the press book in Toronto called it . ) Though not as violent , dry , or British as Shaun of the Dead , Fido remains true to its roots : a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both Lassie and the infamous sci - fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period.<br /><br />Fido 's talented headliners ( Carrie Anne Moss , Billy Connelly , Dylan Baker , and Tim Blake Nelson ) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script . The film explores all the implications of its premise : a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident . What would you use your new undead servant for ? A butler ? Manual labor ? A pet ? Unspeakable acts ? Fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way , with much thanks to the work of Connelly ( as one of said zombies ) and young TV actor K'Sun Ray , who seems at times to be a better young Elijah Wood than the young Elijah Wood was.<br /><br />If you 're expecting another Shaun of the Dead , do n't waste your time . There 's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you 'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed . But if you 're willing to take a look at what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps across the lake , you 're in for a treat . Think of Fido as the sensitive , more often beaten up little brother to Shaun of the Dead 's rebellious loser , and you 're starting to get the drift . If you like ( or at least tolerate ) zombies , small children , and loads of deadpan satire , Fido 's the film for you . If that 's not the case .... well , you know the drill . Just hit 'em square between the eyes .
1 At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious , on first viewing I 'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with ' Shaun of the Dead ' . Now , given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius , I realise this is a rather big claim . And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether ' Fido ' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where ' Shaun ' left off , except we 're back in the original 1950s Living Dead - era stereotypical middle - American small town . The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well - adjusted , useful members of the community . This , so we 're informed at the outset , is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps ? < br /><br />The beauty of the film lies in its dead - pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose . The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect . Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living , keeping up appearances , repressed emotion , muddled parental values , social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It 's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film 's all - round strong cast . It 's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part . It 's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like ... <br /><br />So in conclusion , it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you .
1 Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it . Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered ( certainly ' fleshed out ' extensively and successfully ) by George Romero . But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it 's a Comedy ! And , YES , I actually think it is better than ' Shawn of the Dead ' . Thoroughly believable and , perhaps even more importantly , enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker , Carrie - Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray , whom I suspect we 'll be seeing a lot more of in future features . However , I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr. Theopolis , essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride ( or , for those who 've seen the film , would n't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride ? ) and , of course , Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated , yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character . Just think , he would not have gotten this role had it not been for Peter Stormare 's commitments to Prison Break ( as was revealed in the Q&A following Thursday night 's screening ) . I ca n't help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead 's Zombie ' Bub'.I am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a Comment and I wo n't start now . Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dour , graphically gory Zombie films you can rely on from Romero . Rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and , although ( and I did have to think back carefully to be sure ) there is a fair dose of blood - letting and violence , the delectable humour , so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by Director Currie and his co - screenwriters , goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated PG-13 . I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem . I 'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer .
1 Saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart , stylish , and FUNNY.<br /><br />The cast was ROCK SOLID . Great work by Carrie Anne Moss , Dylan Baker , Tim Blake Nelson , Billy Connelly and up and comer , Alexia Fast.<br /><br />Weirdly , I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Writers , Dennis Heaton , Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie layered in a lot of political subtext - but did n't whack you over the head with it.<br /><br />The world they created had depth , and made sense . There is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie.<br /><br />FIDO is guaranteed to cure grumpiness.<br /><br />Loved it ! ! !
1 Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition , especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days.<br /><br />As has already been pointed out , this is hardly a real zombie film , but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers . While there are necessarily some bloody scenes , there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented ( feel - good 50s style ) , I ca n't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by Fido & his fellow sufferers.<br /><br />While the cast is generally good , I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out . The humor is not in - your - face , but rather subdued ; there 's a lot of attention to detail and I caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie . This is certainly no masterpiece of cinema , but it does n't strive to be - instead , Currie succeeds in delivering a heart - warming black comedy .
1 Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s , this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence , materialism and keeping up with the Joneses , fear of others , slavery , golf , and the disposing of the dead . Yes , it all sounds a bit heavy , but trust me on this , it 's nearly as light as a feather.<br /><br />Zombies are featured prominently among the characters . Crucial questions arise , such as : who will become a zombie ( 90 % of the Willard folks choose this final path , while only 10 % prefer a traditional funeral ) ? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots ( they 've become a mark of social status ) ? And , what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead ? < br /><br />Somehow , director Andrew Currie , who also co - wrote the lively screenplay ( with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton ) , keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh . A super cast helps : Carrie - Anne Moss , Billy Connolly , Dylan Baker , Henry Czerny , Tim Blake Nelson , Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals , aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy , the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups . ( Having seen her only in " Memento " and " The Matrix , " I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such fine comedienne chops . ) < br /><br />The production design and music are exquisitely 50s , to a tee . Maybe this one is n't for everybody . It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award . But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie - making . For me anyway , " Fido " is a hoot ! My grades : 8.5/10 ( A- ) ( Seen on 01/30/07 )
1 This is the first must see film I 've seen in the last year ! It 's wickedly funny , incredibly original , unbelievably great looking ( they went for this super cool wide - screen Technicolor look that 's awesome to behold , ) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society . It 's really smart satire that nails everything from Homeland Security to race issues , while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear . Carrie Anne Moss turns in a comedic performance I never imagined would come from her ! She 's sweet , funny and sexy ! Billy Connolly is great as Fido who can only grunt and moan ! And Dylan Baker as the Dad is priceless . In fact the whole cast is perfect . Henry Czerny as the bad guy , Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend ( getting the idea now ? ) Funny , though - provoking and just all round amazing ! Go and see this movie ! It 's like nothing you 've ever seen before .
1 A year or so ago , I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area . Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called ' Fido ' as it finished production and began playing at festivals . Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theater . And , just yesterday , I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it 's limited release , with the exception of our local theater . In fact , here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater , including 300 . Of course , this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make - up . And for any other locals who have n't seen Fido yet but are considering it , I can say there are many images on screen , from the school to city park to the forbidden zone , that you will recognize . In fact , they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful . That 's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie ! However , Fido itself is a very good movie . Yes , despite its flaws , it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market . Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead . This is a clever premise . And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950 's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold - war paranoia which led to McCarthyism . Furthermore , it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead.<br /><br />K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who 's mother ( Carrie - Ann Moss ) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block . However , his dad ( Dylan Baker ) is against the idea as he once had to kill his own ' zombie father ' . Eventually , the family does acquire a zombie named ' Fido ' ( played by Billy Connolly ) , and adjusts to life with the undead . Billy Connolly was inspired casting . He is able to convey Fido 's confusion , longing , hatred , and loyalty through only his eyes , lumbering body , and grunts . Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones . This is his best role since Mrs. Brown.<br /><br />Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon . Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw ones , I prefer humor over gore in my horror . However , I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough ' undead carnage ' in Fido . Yet , I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor.<br /><br />The movie does break down in it 's third act . It 's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s , they forgot about the story arc . However , given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen , I rate Fido 9 out of 10 .
1 And this somebody is me . And not only me , as I can see here at IMDb or when leaving the theater . Why did the people love it ? It 's obvious : Everybody knows zombies by now ( at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the " Dawn of the Dead " reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc . ) < br /><br />Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is until this movie came along . And you 'll see zombies in a new light ( perhaps ) . This is not a horror movie , although it does contain some violent scenes , but is rather a comedy . A satire to be precise . And it never runs out of steam ! That is why I rated it so high . Pacing wise it 's incredible , the acting is great and the script has no ( obvious ) mistakes ... quite the contrary : It 's a gem and if you 're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it ! And even if you dislike them , watch it ! Because it 's a great ( comedy ) movie !
1 This film takes place in the 1950s . According to this the dead ( called zombies ) have arisen to eat the living . However a company has developed a collar that , when put around the zombies neck , makes them docile and perfect servants . The Robinsons mom Helen ( Carrie - Anne Moss ) , dad Bill ( Dylan Baker ) and son Timmy ( K'Sun Ray ) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one . Tim names the zombie Fido ( Billy Connolly ) and becomes friends with him . But his dad hates him and Timmy looses control of Fido and things go wrong.<br /><br />As you can see this is -- among many other things -- a takeoff on the " Lassie " series with Fido being a stand in for Lassie . Timmy was named that for a reason ! Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here . My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat him ! Also it 's a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk films where everything is bright and colorful -- but dark secrets are tearing people apart . The characters wear VERY bright 1950s clothes ( Moss is always in a dress)--the furnishings , settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors . Even when the script becomes repetitious there 's always something to look at . The script is good -- but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can make . The melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off . Everyone here is excellent and right on target . Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job . Moss is the best -- playing each line for all its worth --- but never going overboard.<br /><br />This is n't for everybody ( of course ) . The satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame . The gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it 's hard to take it seriously . So , for some people , this will really work . I give it an 8 .
1 My goodness . This movie really really shows the talents of actors . Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle . Truly an amazing man , if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel , Boondock Saints as a madman / killer , and then finally in Fido as a zombie ! His character in Fido looks from cute to frightening , absolutely fabulous ! Cariie Ann Moss is no hack either ! Jumping in career from Matrix and Momento as a darker character , to a heart warming conservative 1950 's housewife ! Rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type - casted.<br /><br />Now onto the storyline ( No Spoilers , do n't worry ) . This movie would make Max Brooks ( Author of Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z ) happy with joy ! Finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy.<br /><br />If you like zombies , if you do n't like zombies , if you are just bored , or if you are too busy , go see this movie !
1 When you see the cover of the DVD you 're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie , a film made for $ 1,000 in somebody 's backyard.<br /><br />Wrong ! < br /><br />This is quality material and really good . It 's a comedy and a clever one at that . It also is very touching in spots , with a nice spot of kindness . The production values are very good ( this looks excellent ) , the actors are known , the film 's direction and sets are great . It 's amazing . Who would have thought?<br /><br />Carrie - Ann Moss , playing against - type , is terrific , as"Helen Robinson , " the June Cleaver - like wife ; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good - hearted zombie " Fido ; " Tim Blake Nelson ( " Mr . Theopolis " ) is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend " Tammy , " and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads ( check ) are excellent , too K'Sun Ray as young " Timmy Robinson , " should n't be overlooked , either . In fact , he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.<br /><br />If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it . You 'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very , very pleasant surprise . You need a dark sense of humor , though ; an appreciation of the absurd .
1 As soon as I heard about this film I knew I had to check it out . Well , I heard about it , then I found the trailer . After that , that 's when I knew I had to see it . And I am so glad I did . You want to see classic television mixed with zombies ? No ? Then get lost.<br /><br />FIDO is a movie unlike anything I 've ever seen . Well , actually , it kind of is . It 's kind of like a Lassie episode and a Zombie film . Though when combined , it feels completely new and original . FIDO is about a little boy named Timmy and his new pet Fido . Well this new pet ai n't no squawking parakeet or some potty - trained puppy . It 's a re - animated dead guy ... a zombie . A large radiation cloud engulfed Earth which led to all of the dead rising , which ensued the Zombie Wars . Though through the genius of Reinhold Giger , lead scientist of ZomCon , he discovered that if you destroy the brain , the zombie will perish , thus giving us the edge and the win in the Zombie War . Though due to lingering radiation , whoever dies becomes a zombie . Which can be a problem especially with the elderly . Though Zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs , especially with the Domestication Collar . The collar stops the zombie 's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet . But not all is perfect in this Zombie Utopia , collars break , old people die and .... well I 'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick.<br /><br />FIDO is a fantastic idea brought to fruition . With an all - star cast , and great writing FIDO rises above most in the comedy / horror genre . There are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained . Though after seeing the film , I personally think the movie would have been better in black and white . At less than 90 minutes , the movie does n't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate . It 'll probably end up being a cult - classic of sorts , since it 's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie . It 's a comedy / family / zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe . If you thought anything I said here was interesting by all means check this film out . But if you 're still on the fence , swing your leg back over and stay there . 8.5 outta 10
1 OK , I did n't know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido , honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie , but nothing about it really grabbed my attention . But when I was looking around in Netflix , they were advertising this like crazy if I liked " goofy " scary movies , so I figured to just give it a shot . I 'm so glad that I did watch it , this was just a great movie , it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch . Like I said , it 's Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead , it 's just a great concept , what does happen after a mega zombie attack ? As we see in another zombie comedy , Shaun of the Dead , they have fun by making the zombies left over as " handy " citizens . This is a very overlooked horror / comedy movie , I think a lot of people were just so blown away with Shaun of the Dead that this got the boot . But it 's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie.<br /><br />In a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies . This radiation still plagues humanity , as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead . In order to continue living normal lives , communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named Zomcon . Zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies ' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants . In the town of Willard , a housewife , Helen , buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill 's zombie phobia . Their son , Timmy , befriends the zombie , naming him " Fido " . One day Fido 's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor , who turns into a zombie . Timmy " kills " the zombified neighbor . When a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor , they capture Fido and Timmy . Helen comes and rescues Timmy and Fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing . Several days later , the neighbor 's body is found and the murder is traced back to Fido , who is taken away to Zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed . Timmy learns through a friend that Fido is simply working in a factory at Zomcon . Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get Fido back.<br /><br />I really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it , it 's so silly but a lot of fun . Billy Connelly did a great job as Fido and really brought , no pun intended , a lot of life into the character . I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Timmy has to burry the old lady that Fido attacked and killed , his last words to her were so funny , " you were n't really nice , but you liked flowers , so  " and he buries her in the garden . Not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend , sick , disturbing , wrong , but classic laughs . I still love how even though this is like the Leave It To Beaver - esquire type of world , there still is a lot of gore in the movie . So if you do have a chance to see Fido , take it , I promise some good laughs.<br /><br />9/10
1 Even without speaking a word , Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as " Mom " ? , even better . Zombie girlfriends ? < br /><br />" ... My father thied to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy . " < br /><br />And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good . It 's kinda like Airplane meets ( meats ? ) Night of the Living Dead , sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /><br />And do n't forget my head coffin < br /><br />And Fido in an Aloha shirt is just way cool!<br /><br />And yes , the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on . < br /><br />Sufice it to say , it all really works !
1 Loved it ! What 's not to like ?-- you got your suburbia , you got your zombies , you got your family issues , you got your social dilemmas , you got yourself one Fine Retro-1950's - style Flesh Eating Under Class Held At Bay By An Uneasy Worried About Whether They 're The Next Meal Upper Crust . You could n't ask for more.<br /><br />Cast is superb . Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife . She 's both wanton , and criminally conspiratorial . Every fellow 's dream . K'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence , and somehow succeeding . He 's a genuine screen presence . Very photogenic , and natural . Without naming them all , the rest of the cast is wonderful . Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it 's his everyday persona . Billy Connolly is delightful as Fido . A fine actor : I wish that he had played the title role in " Braveheart , " with Gibson directing . My sense is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character . His Fido is contained , yet accessible . A nice touch.<br /><br />In short , a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals , values , social pinnings , feelings , growth , coping in uncertain times , and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions . A true reality show .
1 In an alternate 1950s , where an outbreak of the undead ( caused by a mysterious ' space - dust ' ) has been contained through the use of special electronic collars , a young loner , Timmy , finds a friend in Fido ( Billy Connelly ) , his family 's recently acquired domesticated zombie.<br /><br />Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy , whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son ( or for his hot - to - trot wife , played by the gorgeous Carrie - Anne Moss ) having been psychologically scarred as a child ( when he was forced to shoot his own father , who tried to eat him!).<br /><br />Timmy runs into a spot of bother , however , when his putrid pal 's collar goes on the blink , and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour . With the authorities on Fido 's trail , trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies , and his mother forming a bond with their undead house - help , will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?<br /><br />A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick , Fido is a thoroughly entertaining , deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour . Taking the Romero zombie - verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius , and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole ' reanimated dead ' theme that I have seen.<br /><br />Connelly 's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame , along with Day Of The Dead 's Bub , and Return Of The Living Dead 's Tarman ; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse , but The Big Yin 's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus ! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances , with young K'Sun Ray ( as Timmy ) and Ms . Moss deserving special mentionsRay , because , for one so young , he puts in a particularly assured turn , and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!<br /><br />This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week ( the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead ) , and , to my surprise , it is also the best . Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 9 for IMDb .
1 I watched FIDO on some movie channel and I have to say that I 've become an instant fan . The film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s , you know the wholesome decade when they danced to Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it . People were so naive back then that it 's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here.<br /><br />Kudos to this Canadian production , the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast , including Carrie Anne Moss , Billy Connolly , Henry Czerny and the kid.<br /><br />It 's a shame this film was n't a bigger hit . It deserved more recognition . It 's much better than the stuff from Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team . Oh well . It 's an instant classic nonetheless .
1 Fidois a very odd film . And in many ways , a very good one.<br /><br />My first thought after viewing , was how the hell are they going to market this thing ? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies , Fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies . Does n't exactly trip off the tongue.<br /><br />Fido has little of Shaun 's carnage , gore & belly laughs . It is a different beast altogether ( forgive the pun).<br /><br />Fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh - eaters into dumb servants.<br /><br />At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée , but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle - class nostalgia.<br /><br />Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely kid who does n't fit in at school . His mom is would - be social climber , and his dad is nervy and detached.<br /><br />Seeking to keep up with the Joneses , mom ( Carry - Anne Moss ) has acquired a zombie . Jimmy is disinterested at first , but ' Fido ' ( Billy Conelley ) soon proves a great buddy for Jimmy . Until his collar goes on the blink ... <br /><br />Fido is NOT a horror film , but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS.<br /><br />Much of the humour is of the light family variety , and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog / family moments.<br /><br />Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark , truly funny moments , which while welcome , will ensure an R rating for what is , for extended periods , a family comedy.<br /><br />The film looks gorgeous , and is wonderfully performed by all involved.<br /><br />Despite its difficult tonal problems , I hope this movie finds a niche , as it 's quite a little gem in this year 's deluge of cinematic crap .
1 I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto . This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I would n't be able to get in to see my first choice . Well , I was totally blown away . By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie ( yes , I actually forgot who was even in it . ) Terrific performances from the entire cast . Carrie - Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity . As for Billy Connolly , I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what - so - ever . The kids were also great . Definitely check this one out if you get the chance.<br /><br />And , by the way , I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better .
1 In the immortal " Shaun of the Dead " , we are introduced to a London where the slackers and the high - and - mighty alike are forced to battle flesh - eating , reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family . At the end of the film , it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour . " Fido " presents us with an epilogue to " Shaun " set in 1950 's America , in a hilariously witty and original " what - if ... ? " movie.<br /><br />The film is set post - zombie - apocalypse , for a change ; after the terrors of the Zombie Wars , ended by the creation of the ZomCon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs . Every town in the world is fenced off from the Wild Zone , the once - fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left - overs from the apocalyptic wars . The idyllic town of Willard is your typical , pristine 50 's suburbia , with one small difference ; social status is measured by a family 's amount of domesticated zombies . Unfortunately , the Robinson family has no zombies whatsoever , due to their patriarch , Bill 's , fear of the reanimated dead . Timmy Robinson and his mother Helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life , until the day that Helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours.<br /><br />The zombie earns Timmy 's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies , and the two form a bond to rival the classic " boy - and - his - dog " cliché ... a boy and his zombie . Timmy names his " pet " Fido , and he soon becomes an aid for both Timmy and Helen to escape the prison - like routine Bill has put them in . But when Fido 's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly Mrs Henderson , the Robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved Fido.<br /><br />A film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all - star cast ( including " The Matrix " 's Carrie - Anne Moss as Helen Robinson and Billy Connelly as Fido ) , " Fido " is a zom - com for the ages . With some rather twisted subplots - for example , the sweet and unsettling feelings that Helen and Fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50 's suburbia and the zombie genre , the film manages to bring out the worst ( and the best ) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them.<br /><br />"Fido " is , by far , one of the best dark comedies I 've ever seen , one of the best films that I 've seen in a long time , and THE best zom - com since the incredible " Shaun of the Dead " .
1 I really enjoyed this movie . The acting by the adult actors was great , although I did find the main kid a little stiff . But he carried himself very well for being a new talent . The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk . I.e. The Nutty Professor . If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably would n't like this as it is a bit slower paced . I picked it up on Blu - ray and I have to say the image quality is top notch . Probably one of the better looking Blu - rays I 've seen so far . The extras were cool too . They deleted quite a bit , but that 's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes did n't really add anything .
1 For the life of me , why did this film receive an R rating ? ! While it IS about flesh - eating zombies , believe it or not , it 's actually a pretty good family - friendly film -- at least if your kids are age 10 and older . Unlike the traditional zombie films , this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values -- albeit a bit twisted ! The language is n't a serious problem , there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids ( much like the old TV show " Eerie , Indiana")--yet some knucklehead slapped an R rating one it ! Believe me , most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film.<br /><br />The story is set in a parallel - type world . While the fashions , cars and mores appear circa 1953 , in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the " zombie war " and massive changes in everyday life . At school , kids are trained in armed combat and there 's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack " just in case " ! As for life outside of school , it 's pretty weird as well , as people now have learned that zombies AREN'T such a bad thing ! Heck , using shock collars and training , they can be made into slaves who can do your housework , clean streets , deliver milk or , in the case of a really sick guy , be your " special friend".<br /><br />This film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave ( played by Billy Connally ) . Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie 's friend . Dad , on the other hand , is n't convinced -- as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he has n't yet gotten over this ! ! Funny , irreverent and unique -- this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience .
1 Due to the invention of a " The Domestication Collar " , flesh - eating zombies are brought under control , and become productive members of society ; however , they perform menial tasks . The servile dead attend to those living in fenced US 1950s - styled small towns , while untamed zombies roam around in " The Wild Zone " . In the town of " Willard " , pre - teen K'Sun Ray ( as Timmy Robinson ) lives with parents Carrie - Anne Moss and Dylan Baker ( as Helen and Bill Robinson ) . Alas , the Robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie ; their new neighbors , the Bottoms , have six . So , to keep up , the Robinsons obtain zombie Billy Connolly ( as Fido).<br /><br />Unfortunately , Mr. Connolly 's " Domestication Collar " is damaged by an old lady 's walker , and he eats her ; then , new and hungry zombies infest the town . Meanwhile , young Ray has grown attached to Connolly ( the boy and his zombie are like TV 's " Timmy and Lassie " ) and , the Robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling " Zomcom " authorities . < br /><br />"Fido " does n't go far enough into its own intriguing " Wild Zone " ; but , it is a colorful , stylish , and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore . Ray and the cast perform well , individually ; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett ( as Tammy ) and owner Tim Blake Nelson ( as Theopolis ) the most memorable pair . Director Andrew Currie and crew , including Rob Gray ( design ) , Jan Kiesser ( photography ) , Don MacDonald ( music ) , and James Willcock ( design ) , deservedly won awards.<br /><br / > * * * * * * * Fido ( 2006 ) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray , Carrie - Anne Moss , Billy Connolly , Dylan Baker
1 Who says zombies ca n't be converted into useful members of the community ? Certainly not the makers of " Fido , " who take us to a never - never - land version of the 1950 's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class . Timmy Robinson is the all - American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family 's new full - time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido . All of this has been made possible by Zomcom , a big - brother - type organization that has found a way to render the zombies ( who were originally brought to " life " by radiation from outer space ) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.<br /><br />This twisted , modern - day spin on the TV series " Lassie " - it might easily have been entitled " A Boy and His Zombie " - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity ( here keeping - up - with - the - Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door ) , the sterility of suburban life , the corporate control of civic affairs , small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti - colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns . The movie does n't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs . Instead , this is a low - keyed , subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full - bellied guffaws . Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community ( Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine ) . Despite some playfully graphic violence , the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950 's itself and the cheesy , low - budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.<br /><br />K'Sun Ray , Carrie - Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide - eyed Timmy and his Cleaver - esquire parents ( with slightly sinister undertones ) , while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.<br /><br />This is what " Lassie " might have been had Timmy 's best friend been afflicted rabies .
1 " Fido " is to be commended for taking a tired genre , zombies , and turning it into a most original film experience . The early 50s atmosphere is stunning , the acting terrific , and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning . Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars , " Eisenhower era " dress , art deco furniture , and zombie servants . It would be very easy to dismiss " Fido " as cartoon - like fluff , similar to " Tank Girl " , but the two movies are vastly different . " Fido has structure , a script that tells a story , and acting that is superior . Make no mistake , this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed . Highly recommended . - MERK
1 Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race . All falls apart though , when young Timmy 's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor . From then on , disaster ( well , maybe not disaster , but to some extent , chaos ) occurs . Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness , and one such character sleeps with his zombie ( very funny part of the movie , if not also very disturbing too ) . And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do . This is a very funny and unique film , especially for the zombie genre . It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies ( no negativity in this statement ) . I very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different . I rate this 8/10 . Rated R for zombie related violence
1 Along with " Aparadektoi , the best Greek Comedy series ever !

Surely a serial you will never stop enjoying !

Every time , I see the replays and every time when it finishes I miss it .. One of my favorite All time classics ...
1 Eglimata (= Crimes ) is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster . One of the smartest Greek series ever!Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible ' guilty ' laughing . Every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had . Actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in Greek audience 's heart . My personal favourites ( apart the first two i mentioned)are Vassilis Haralambopoulos , Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time . Whoever around the world understands Greek should find a way to watch this series , even though it 's been more than 5 years that it was on TV.In Greece they keep repeating the series ( ANT1 ) in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones . We'll never forget Eglimata or any of the casting crew !
1 This is a quite slow paced movie , slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger . The viewer slowly feels that there 's something wrong here ... < br /><br />I really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end . It is clever , well paced and very well acted . Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply into their characters . < br /><br />The little son " pierrot " is also very touching.<br /><br />A thriller which does not seem like one . A very unconventional movie , very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes.<br /><br />i'll give it a 8/10 ! !
1 it 's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it . I enjoyed it because I was n't expecting what I was seeing , but an ordinary sex - drama so .... It 's a pscyho - sexual thriller , in which nothing is what it seems . It features Emmanuelle Seigner , no stranger to the genre ( and to nudity ) in which her husband , Polanski , had directed her . And a creepy performance ( did I say creepy / yes CREEPY ) from Toreton ( Bernard Tavernier 's actor ) . It looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski ( better than Bitter Moon ) , like a Chabrol gone astray or Clouzot thriller ( I have seen someone mentioning Les Diaboliques ) , but closer to Georges Franju 's Les Yeux sans Visage ( Eyes without a face , the godfather of Dr. Phibes and more ) . A gem ! I am just afraid they will blow this into a Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing .
1 An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder . Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease , it was hard to tell the man was even acting . Maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice / narrator of " City Confidential " , Winfield ends his career with a so - so movie ; but as always , Winfield shines . A treat to watch.<br /><br />Erika Eliniak is well , Erika Eliniak , nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department . Though , to be fair , this is one of her better efforts.<br /><br />Bottom line : a watchable thriller that should n't be missed by any Paul Winfield fan . A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven . What an actor . He will be missed .
1 We 're talking about a low budget film , and it 's understandable that there are some weaknesses ( no spoilers : one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic ) ; but in general the story keeps you interested , most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations . < br /><br />I really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot ... I applaud this one on that . < br /><br />If you know what I mean , try to see also " Nueve Reinas " ( Nine Queens ) a film from Argentina .
1 Strange enough , all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over . I feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work , since Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein 's wife , and the - excellent - jazz music was written by te director 's father , André . Under these circumstances , no wonder it was a really good thriller , seen when issued and immediately identified with the music . The suspense was flawless , and maintained throughout until the end . Robert Hossein , at the time one of the best European players , managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director . He 's still putting up great stage shows , with a preference for religious subjects.harry carasso , Paris , France
1 " Toi le Venin " is Robert Hossein 's masterpiece , and one of the great thrillers of the fifties . Based on a Frederic Dard novel , a writer the director often worked with ( see also " le Monte - Charge " which Hossein did not direct but in which he was the lead too),the screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful blonde might be the fieriest of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale .. and her sister . Then begins a cat and mouse play .One of the sisters is in a wheelchair .But is she really disabled?Which one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero on that night ? < br /><br />The two actresses , Marina Vlady and the late Odile Versois were sisters.<br /><br />Turn off all the lights before watching . Highly suspenseful .
1 WHEN I first saw this film , in London , in 1958 , I was bowled over . I had never seen a film like this before . It had a strange , hypnotic effect , quite unlike the films that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact.<br /><br />I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters , if not twins . Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer.<br /><br />If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language , I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased .
1 The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences , inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift , sure justice ; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts . It is , in fact , one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan ( as played by Clint Eastwood ) so popular . He carries a badge and works within the law , but at heart , Harry is a vigilante , meting out justice ` his ' way , which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors , as well as the criminals he 's pursuing . But it 's what draws the audience ; anyone who 's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another , delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it 's only on the screen . And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes ` Sudden Impact , ' directed by and starring Eastwood , so successful . In this one , the fourth of the series , while working a homicide , Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own , with one exception : Whoever it is , he 's definitely not carrying a badge.<br /><br />In his own inimitable way , Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time . So he does ; as only ` Dirty Harry ' can . In a small town north of San Francisco , Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case , which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator . Unaccountably , Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief , Jannings ( Pat Hingle ) , who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere . Not one to be deterred , however , Harry continues his investigation , which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist , Jennifer Spencer ( Sondra Locke ) . Gradually , Harry discovers a link between the victims ; the burning question , though , is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?<br /><br />Eastwood is in top form here , both in front of and behind the camera , and it is arguably the second best of the five - film series , right behind the original ` Dirty Harry . ' It had been seven years since the last ` Harry ' offering ( ` The Enforcer , ' 1976 ) , but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor . And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director 's chair , as he is able to recapture the essence of , not only his own character , but that ` spirit ' that made these films so successful , and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between # s 3 and 4 . As with all the films he directs , Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end . < br /><br />The screenplay , by Joseph Stinson , is well written and formulated to that distinctive ` Dirty Harry ' style ; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself ( conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith ) is the most engaging since the original ` Dirty Harry , ' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama , rather than entirely upon the action . The characters are well drawn and convincing , and , of course , this is the film that gave us one of Harry 's best catch - phrases : ` Go , ahead-- make my day ... '<br /><br />As Harry , Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular : He lives by a personal moral code , a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today . Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear , possibly more so today than ever before . No matter who we are or where we come from , there 's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry , or at least have him around . ` Dirty Harry ' is an icon of the cinema , and it 's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him ; for better or worse , Eastwood ` is ' Dirty Harry , without question , just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone , Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer , a young woman wronged and out for vengeance , or as she sees it , ` justice . ' She manages to bring a hard - edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character , with a convincing , introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the ` action ' genre . Even amid the violence , Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life . Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood 's Harry , and becomes , in philosophy and deed , something of his counterpart.<br /><br />In supporting roles , two performances stand out : Paul Drake , as Mick , creates the best ` psycho ' since Andy Robinson 's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original ` Dirty Harry . ' With actually very limited screen time , Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing , which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience . This is the guy you ca n't wait to see Harry take care of in the end . Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan , who makes her character , Ray Parkins , the epitome of the proverbial ` low life , ' who can be found in any bar in any city . It 's a performance that evokes a gut - level response , and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film , in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell ( Horace ) , Mark Kevloun ( Bennett ) and Nancy Parsons ( Mrs. Kruger ) . With a perfect blend of drama and action , ` Sudden Impact ' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality ; the perfect justice of a not - so - perfect world , that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience . 9/10 .
1 Sudden Impact is the 4th of the Dirty Harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they do n't really degrade in quality from one film to the next . Thus , Sudden Impact provides another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan . This time Harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation . Harry 's always on the job it seems . Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action , slow , deliberate , and without fear . As the first of the Dirty Harry films to be made in the 80 's , Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70 's feel that characterizes the first three films . This does n't mean that it 's quality is any less . Bottom Line : Brimming with intensity and action , Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series .
1 The fourth in the " Dirty Harry " series , this film features one of the most despicable , ugliest , unlikable , profane , disgusting females I have ever seen on film : " Ray Perkins , " played by Audrie Neenan . She is the modern nasty low - life version of the 1945 " Detour " character , " Ann Savage." < br /><br />Her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much I never watched this film again until I acquired a profanity filter which shut her up .... and least some of her ! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Everywhere " Harry Callahan " ( Clint Eastwood ) goes , violence immediately follows ..... within minutes ! It happens so often it 's almost laughable but it makes for a fast - moving , entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one - by - one.<br /><br />This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts ..... and connects , sad to say . Most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end , and who does it better than Dirty Harry ?
1 The Dirty Harry series began with very gritty cop action , and was almost immediately lightened up for " Magnum Force " . By the time that " The Enforcer " rolled around , Dirty Harry was little more than a television cop show ( saved only by Tyne Daly ) . After a break of seven years , Dirty Harry has finally gone back to his roots . Maybe he 's been gone for too long this time.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood makes the first well - directed Harry film since Don Siegel made the first , which helps considerably . Harry is a darker character once again , not the nice cop he had become . He can once again say things like " Go ahead , make my day " and really mean it . " Sudden Impact " is a true Dirty Harry sequel . " The Enforcer " should never have been made.<br /><br />7.2 out of 10
1 With Harry Callahan getting up in years , the inevitable ` old man with a chip on his shoulder ' story had to come into play eventually . Callahan , looking fragile sometimes and out of place , his demeanor still was unwavering . Thankfully , this film took some time off to develop a different type of story , one that might reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre . While the film fell short in doing so , it was still an excellent addition to the series , even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music .
1 With this movie being the only Dirty Harry movie which Clint Eastwood not only stars , but produces and directs as well , you know it 's got to be good . Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series , I completely disagree . In my opinion , apart from the original Dirty Harry , Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series . Although The Enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences , it does n't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do . This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good , and it 's got the quotes that make a Dirty Harry film good . In Diry Harry it 's " .. Well do ya , punk ? " ; in Magnum Force " A man 's got to know his limitations " ; and in this it 's " Go ahead . Make my day . " Also in this film it 's nice to see a change of scenery , as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco streets in the other films in the series . With great acting by Clint Eastwood and co - star Sandra Locke , and good directing by Clint , this is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever .
1 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * After two so - so outings ( " Magnum Force " and " The Enforcer " ) , Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in " Sudden Impact , " a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths : the charisma of Clint Eastwood , who also directed , and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.<br /><br />For once , the case takes Harry outside his native San Francisco ( where he 's again in trouble with his superiors for his " shoot first , ask questions later " tactics ) , to the hamlet of San Paulo . There , ( WARNING : Potential spoiler ) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered , one at a time , by a woman whom they gang - raped years earlier , and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.<br /><br />The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke , and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold - bloodedness . Locke 's cold eyes and frosty voice , when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists , are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.<br /><br />The rapists are a despicable lot , especially the leader , who has " psycho nutjob " practically stamped on his forehead , and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys , despite her anatomical inability to participate . The flashback scenes , while not graphically explicit , are nightmarish enough , and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her assailants.<br /><br />Some will dismiss " Sudden Impact " as trash : a mindless , manipulative revenge tale . On a certain level this is true , but it 's well - done trash . What works to the movie 's advantage is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance , giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech . What we have here is an action movie with a point of view.<br /><br />You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary , but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to Harry ( a realization that , wisely , is not spelled out with dialogue ) , he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate . This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare.<br /><br />The movie 's other redeeming quality is Eastwood 's direction . This is , after all , a Dirty Harry movie , and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else . The movie is directed with style and wit , and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff . Some of the best " Harry moments " in the entire series are here , including Harry 's best - known line , " Go ahead -- make my day." < br /><br />"Sudden Impact " is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow . It is also a riveting detective story , well made and well told . And it is certainly never dull . On those criteria , it succeeds tremendously .
1 It 's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly ( if only in comparison to other films in its legacy ) , and others in a ' sub - plot ' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong . Sudden Impact is one of those cases , where Clint Eastwood as star / producer / director shows when he can be at his best , or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime / mystery / detective story in his Dirty Harry fame . We get that ' make my day ' line , and un - like in the first film where his ' do I feel lucky ' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails , here it 's switched around . He gets into another shamble with the department , as usual , when he tries to fight crime ' his ' way , in particular with a diner robbery ( inspiration for Pulp Fiction ? ) and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus . He 's told to ' take a vacation ' , and that 's the last thing on his mind . This whole main plot is n't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines , which just adds to the frustration . But soon his story merges with the sub - plot that Eastwood develops from the start.<br /><br />Enter Sandra Locke 's character , Jennifer Spencer , whom we soon learn after some ( appropriately ) mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel , unjust sexual assault ( err , outright rape ) , and is sleekly , undercover - like , getting revenge . Her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film , the most intense , and finally when it goes into Callahan 's storyline ( he 's getting facts in the same small town she 's in on a murder ) , the film finally finds a focus between Eastwood 's classic form of clearly defined good vs. evil ( though sometimes blurred , to be sure ) . Eastwood films the flashbacks , not to say too much about them , expertly , in a fresh , experimental style ; the trademark Lalo Schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others . It almost seems like a couple of times an art - house sensibility has crept into Eastwood 's firmly straightforward storytelling style , which helps make the film watchable.<br /><br />It 's a shame , though , that in the end it goes more for the expectable ( or maybe not expectable ) points , and until the third act Callahan does n't have much to do except his usual ' it 's smith ... Wesson ... and me ' shtick . However , with Locke he gets out of her a very good performance ( more subtle and touching than the one in the Gauntlet ) and an exciting climax at an amusement park . In a way I do and do n't agree with Ebert 's remark that it 's like a ' music video ' in Eastwood 's style here . I admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both , the directness , but the scenes where Eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video . It 's cheesy , it 's hard - edged , it 's not up to par with the first two ' Harry ' pictures , but hey , there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the .44 .
1 Inspector " Dirty " Harry Callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work . Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco . However , he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city , which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.<br /><br />As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments , including the legendary " Go ahead , make my day " line that Eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery . Very badass and it just what fans can expect from him . However , the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer . The problem is that this killer is n't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is . This really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with , pardon the pun , Magnum Force.<br /><br />On the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to Harry 's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before , but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed . However , a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you do n't mind something a little different , it is a good movie for fans . --- 7/10<br /><br />Rated R for violence and a rape scene
1 Anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying . There were n't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot . Virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society . The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby - pamby , lily - livered , melee - mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of " political correctness " . < br /><br />The performances across the board were compelling . I sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same , found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug , vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers . In particular , I found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films I 've seen , so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good . The lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly , so it was only fitting that Dirty Harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end . This was the only sequel in the dirty Harry saga that equaled the first .
1 Director / star Clint Eastwood 's " Sudden Impact " is an intriguing addition to the " Dirty Harry " series - a combination of crude film - making and genius . It 's mediocre and silly in parts , brilliant and classic in others , with compelling , gripping pacing . There are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up " Make my day " scene recalls the " Do you feel lucky " one , one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film 's Scorpio , an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as Harry 's partner - just to name a few.<br /><br />Harry Callahan is still at odds with the higher - ups in the department , still mean , still tough , but now he 's older and wearier . His constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice , the two things not always being compatible . This " incompatibility " is the underlying theme of the series . The first film posed a simple question , " What about the victim 's rights ? " - ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ? Vice versa ? Depends ? ) . That film 's answer was controversial , prompting a sequel ( the highly enjoyable " Magnum Force " ) which set out to draw the line between Harry 's brand of justice and pure , heartless vigilantism . Dirty Harry , like many of Clint 's other roles , is the personification of vengeance , the protector of the the defenseless . This movie however brings it back to the victim , in this case Jennifer ( portrayed by Sondra Locke ) , who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now - incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men ( and one woman ) who committed the crime.<br /><br />Without going into a play - by - play of the whole movie , I will say this - I mentioned earlier that " Sudden Impact " echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in - jokes from the whole series ( the confusion concerning the captain 's last name is an example - an intentional prank , I believe ) . The relationship between Callahan and Jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul - mate in this lady vigilante ? And is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister 's tarnished rights ? The exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series , one which I personally ( as a fan ) found quite moving . That last scene alone makes Sudden Impact the legitimate climax to the " Dirty Harry " collection , the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film . ( Not to knock " The Dead Pool " - that excellent movie was a relatively light - hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring Harry Callahan , rather than a character - defining film like this one).<br /><br />This movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the Reagan Era found Harry and his ilk quite appealing , and the President himself frequently quoted " Go ahead , make my day . "
1 Having never seen the original Dirty Harry , I judged this movie on a clean slate . And I must say , I quite enjoyed it . Sure , some of the acting by Sondre Locke made me a little squeemish - but hey , it was the 80 's . But even if you ca n't get past her ( and I almost could n't ) or her revenge killings ( which seemed a little .. overdone ; P ) , it 's worth it just for Dirty Harry . Or at the very least , the bull dog he affectionately names ' MeatHead ' : P < br /><br />7/10 .
1 Clint Eastwood reprises his role as Dirty Harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante ( Sondra Locke)who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago . Eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk , not that I 'm complaining . Sudden Impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment .
1 Clint Eastwood would star again as the battle - weary Detective Harry Callahan , but would also direct the fourth entry in the ' Dirty Harry ' series . ' Sudden Impact ' again like the other additions , brings its own distinguishable style and tone , but if anything it 's probably the most similar to the original in it 's darker and seedy moments ( and bestowing a classic line " Go ahead . Make my day " )   but some of its humor has to been seen to believe . A bulldog   named meathead that pisses and farts . Oh yeah . However an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in San Francisco.<br /><br />The story follows that of detective Callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes . After getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood . He 's ordered to take leave , but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town San Paulo , where a murder has occurred similar in vein ( bullet to groin and between eyes ) to his case . There he begins to dig up dirt , which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.<br /><br />To be honest , I was n't all that crash hot on Eastwood 's take , but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel ' Magnum Force ' . This well - assembled plot actually gives Eastwood another angle to work upon ( even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time ) , quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging . It 's like he 's experimenting with noir - thriller touches with character - driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework . His use of images is lasting , due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics . Dark tones , brooding lighting   like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure ( Harry with his new .44 automag handgun ) moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks . It 's a striking sight that builds fear ! Mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor . It seemed to come off . A major plus with these films are the dialogues , while I would n't call ' Sudden Impact ' first - rate , it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines   " You 're a legend in your own mind " . Do n't you just love hearing Harry sparking an amusing quip , before pulling out his piece . The beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense   the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages . Lalo Schfrin would return as composer ( after ' The Enforcer " had Jerry Fielding scoring ) bringing a methodical funky kick , which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get - go . Bruce Surtees ( an Eastwood regular ) gets the job behind the camera ( where he did a piecing job with ' Dirty Harry ' ) and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes , but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments.<br /><br />Eastwood as the dinosaur Callahan still packs a punch , going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger Callahan . This going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of Harry 's quest for justice   by the badge even though he does n't always agree with it . I just found it odd   a real change of heart . Across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time Sondra Locke . Her turn of traumatic torment ( being senselessly raped along with her younger sister ) , is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity . When the anger is released , it 's tactically accurate in its outcome . Paul Drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and Audrie J. Neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big - mouthed performance . These people are truly an ugly bunch of saps . Pat Hingle is sturdy as the Chief of the small coastal town . In smaller parts are Bradford Dillman and the agreeably potent Albert Popwell ( a regular in the series 1 - 4 , but under different characters ) . How can you forget him in ' Dirty Harry '   yes he is bank robber that 's at the end of the trademark quote " Do I feel lucky ? Well , do ya , punk ? "
1 I liked nearly all the movies in the Dirty Harry series with the exception of the one I think is titled " Enforcer " . " Deadpool " was a bit weak in areas too , but I still enjoyed it . This one is one of my favorites of the series , if nothing else for the great line of " Go ahead , make my day " . This one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong . Just think " Magnum Force " with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot . Granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park . It also features Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene . The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his movies . She brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me . Granted she is not to bad here , but her character could have been so much better by someone else . Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies , at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns . I like guns as much as the next person , but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds ? Still , very nice entry into the Dirty Harry series of movies .
1 Sudden Impact is a two pronged story . Harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and Harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it 's done . This little war puts Harry on suspension which he does n't care about but he goes away on a little vacation . Now the second part of the story . Someone is killing some punks and Harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets Jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet . The police Chief is not a subtle man and he warns Harry to not get involved or cause any trouble . This is Harry Callahan Trouble follows him . The mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as Harry goes to war . Meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her . Jennifer Spencer is caught and Harry comes to her rescue during the film 's climax . Sudden Impact is not the greatest Dirty Harry but at the time it gives us a Harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue Justice . Again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line . Go Ahead Make your day .
1 Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th movie of the Dirty Harry series . Clint is older but he 's still got it , Harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery ( where the memorable " Make My Day " catchphrase comes from ! ) But the city he took a vacation was worse , a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one . The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie ! An improvement after The Enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious . Clint Eastwood 's sunglasses were Gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator . Worth a watch if you like Clint Eastwood , the Dirty Harry films or like action crime thrillers .
1 In Don Siegel 's 1971 masterpiece " Dirty Harry " , Clint Eastwood epitomized the super - tough , super - cool unorthodox , no - nonsense cinema - cop with his role of the eponymous Inspector ' Dirty ' Harry Callahan . Two sequels followed , the first of which , " Magnum Force " , tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences . The second sequel , " The Enforcer " was grittier again , and was promoted as " the dirtiest Harry of them all " . This title , however , truly belongs to the fourth film in the series , Clint Eastwood 's own " Sudden Impact " , which is doubtlessly the grittiest , nastiest , most violent and downright dirtiest of all Harry films , and , in my humble opinion , the second - best after the masterpiece original.<br /><br />***Warning ! SPOILERS ahead ! * * * In a small town near San Francisco , a mysterious sexy lady ( Sondra Locke ) lures men into being alone with her . What these men do n't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim , longing for bloody revenge . As fate wants it , San Francisco 's toughest cop , Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan , who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors , spends his leisure time in this exact little town ... " Sudden Impact " is the dirtiest Callahan film in several aspects . The film is extremely gritty and graphically violent . Harry Callahan himself is dirtier than ever . Not afraid to make use of his 44 . Magnum in order to stop trouble , Harry treats ' punks ' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge - murders are justified in his opinion . Clint Eastwood is , as always , brilliant in the role of Harry Callahan . Eastwood epitomized coolness and bad - assery as the " Man With No Name " in Sergio Leone 's Dollar Trilogy , and he did so again in the Dirty Harry films . " Sudden Impact " gives us the dirtiest Harry we have ever seen . Eastwood 's real - life girlfriend Sondra Locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty . The great Pat Hingle , who had already worked with Eastwood in Ted Post 's tough - minded Western " Hang ' Em High " in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town . The film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters , including a pathetic criminal played by Kevin Major Howard ( best known for his role in Stanley Kubrick 's " Full Metal Jacket " ) and a woman named Ray Perkins ( Audrie J. Neenan ) , doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema . Albert Popwell , who played the bank robber in the famous " Do You Feel Lucky ? " scene in " Dirty Harry " and the black militant leader in " The Enforcer " is also part of this one again , this time as Harry 's colleague and buddy . Overall " Sudden Impact " is the grittiest , dirtiest and probably the most violent of all " Dirty Harry " films , ( though " The Dead Pool " is n't exactly tame either ) , and my second - favorite after the brilliant 1971 original . An absolute must - see for Callahan fans , and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad - assery . My rating : 8.5/10
1 Sudden Impact was overall better than The Enforcer in my opinion . It was building up to be a great movie , but then I saw the villain(s ) and was disappointed.<br /><br />Sudden Impact was different than the previous installments . The plot went a different direction in this movie , as Dirty Harry does n't take as much of a police approach this time around . We also do n't see the villain(s ) until later , which means less screen time for them , which is better for us all.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as Dirty Harry , enough said . Pat Hingle was enjoyable as Chief Jannings , Harry 's new assigned boss . Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here , either way , he was n't any different . Michael Currie is decent as Lt . Donnelly , Harry 's annoying superior . I personally enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins , the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry . Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace , Harry 's buddy . Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins , a famous lesbian around town . Jack Thibeau was well cast as Kruger , a pervert . Now for the really bad part . Sandra Locke , Eastwood 's long - time lover was horribly miscast as Jennifer Spencer , Harry 's love interest . And Paul Drake was just horrible as Mick.<br /><br />The movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts.<br /><br />8/10 .
1 When this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline " Dirty Harry is at it again " . Whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it 's complete and total accuracy . " Sudden Impact " retains all the aspects that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful- tight pacing , a compelling plot , strong supporting characters , endless gunplay , and bone - dry humor . Some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest , bloodiest , and most overtly right - wing installment of the franchise.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat intriguing : after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums , Inspector Callahan is sent on a forced " vacation " by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of San Paolo . He is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his ( no doubt considerable ) misery by a second shot to the head . Early on in the film , the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named Jennifer Spencer ( Sondra Locke ) who is hunting down the thugs who gang - raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier . This incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback , snippets of which recur before each new murder . As more bodies start to appear with the same M.O , it becomes clear to Harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest ( guess who ? ) know more than they are telling . To make matters even more complicated , the one - time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard.<br /><br />"Sudden Impact " offers relentless action from beginning to end . Clint Eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax . Sondra Locke 's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character . That having been said , it is fair to wonder if another actress ( who was not Eastwood 's off - screen companion at the time ) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- Theresa Russell and Cybill Shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates . Members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include Albert Popwell as Harry 's partner Horace , Paul Drake as the psychopathic Mick , and the truly scene - stealing Audrie J. Neenan who portrays the vicious Ray Parkins . < br /><br />However the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots ( the animosity between Harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums , a Mob vendetta against him ) take up too much screen time and do n't really have any bearing to the larger story . Their only real use is to raise the body - count to absurd levels . In the first half of the film it sometimes appears that Dirty Harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom . However the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat - and - mouse game between Callahan , Spencer , and her former tormentors assumes prominence . This second hour makes it clear that a more stripped - down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given " Sudden Impact " the potential to be a first - class , neo noir - style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the Harry loyalists . Instead we get the film that Eastwood and Warner Bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical Eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it 's intended audience . < br /><br />This was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box - office and it is not hard to see why . Though not the film that it could have been , this is still big , trigger - happy fun . Even after repeated viewings , it 's going to make your day .
1 This was without a doubt the best of the " Dirty Harry " series . From the opening credits , you 're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing . Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge . Eastwood has many " aside " sequences that have nothing to do with the plot , but show Harry at his bad - assed best . Loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles , this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective / action flicks . This is the one Dirty Harry flick that 's raw and devoid of any " fluff " . I can watch this again and again ( okay , not in one sitting ) because it 's a gratifying " out for revenge " yarn . The pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable . " Go ahead - Make my day ... You feel lucky , Punk ? .... " classic Eastwood as only Eastwood , with his anguished , rubbery expressions , and whispery , menacing voice can do it .
1 Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood 's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director . The reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support . In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film . One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it 's a film about guilt , justice and retribution . For me , at the end of the day it 's more empathy than sympathy . However , in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film . Forget the " Go ahead punk , make my day scene " , that 's iconic but not original . But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air , zooming in on the city . The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular . Or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Locke 's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital . Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces . So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director . And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology . Also , I think this is the first well paced film Eastwood directed . Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director , dramaturgy has always been his weak point ( see Play Misty for me , Breezy etc . ) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story . The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog .
1 Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this , but this one does not embarrass him . Dirty Harry catches everyone 's attention and unless one wants to watch romance , there is no reason why you wo n't like him . He is cool because he is dirty , is great because he kills without much thinking , is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he does n't care.<br /><br />From what I have seen in movies in which Eastwood acts , the character of the lead role always captivates the audience . In White Hunter Black heart , he is the crazy director , in " in the Line of Fire " he is the " Old ' un " while here is the " almost " jobless with his job , that is to say he makes work for himself , does n't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.<br /><br />Based on a rape victim , this movie is promising for all the " no non - sense " movie watchers . The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot . However , what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of Eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not , as it is far too obvious from the beginning . It is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving . Also , there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry .
1 After what was considered to be the official Dirty Harry trilogy with The Enforcer(1976 ) to be the final chapter in the series . Dirty Harry is back , older , more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic.<br /><br />Dirty Harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer , vigilante cops , and Vietnam veteran terrorists . But now he 's after a new killer , a killer who wants payback , by gunning down her attackers.<br /><br />Sudden Impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to Dirty Harry . Callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman(played by Sondra Locke ) , who was brutally raped , along with her sister , who is left traumitized . Ten years after , she 's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers . At the same though Callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack , of which the mob are hunting him as well . So in order to let the heat die down within the city , Harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town , but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well , while hunting her attackers one by one . Harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar , as he homes in on the killer 's trails.<br /><br />Sudden Impact in my opinion , has to be one of my top 10 revenge films , as well as being the second best Dirty Harry movie yet , far better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool combined . Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had , a dark tone with entertaining value.<br /><br />So do you feel lucky , punk ?
1 Dirty Harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them . Probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has ... Anyway ..... an action - packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz . The chief rapist , played by Andy Drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end ( of course ! ) . Not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original Dirty Harry .
1 * * * * Excellent < br /><br />***Good < br /><br />**Fair < br /><br />*Poor < br /><br />`Go Ahead , make my Day ! ' < br /><br />The fourth picture in the series is directed by Eastwood himself ( Who was rumored of directing most of Magnum Force ) and he brings back the violent society from the first two films . However , the film still lacks impact and believability . This film was released in the early ` 80s , the time of Regan and the young republicans . The premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist does n't appeal to this time frame . This plot would have been better for the Enforcer , which actually would have made it a good movie . What Sudden Impact needed was a plot like in Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle . < br /><br />RATING : 3 STARS
1 I do nt know why people think this is such a bad movie . Its got a pretty good plot , some good action , and the change of location for Harry does not hurt either . Sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that . Eastwood is in good form as Dirty Harry , and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as the small town cop . If you liked DIRTY HARRY , then you should see this one , its a lot better than THE DEAD POOL . 4/5
1 Sudden Impact is the best of the five Dirty Harry movies . They do n't come any leaner and meaner than this as Harry romps through a series of violent clashes , with the bad guys getting their just desserts . Which is just the way I like it . Great story too and ably directed by Clint himself . Excellent entertainment .
1 Despite the other comments listed here , this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made ; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country 's socio - political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early ' 80 's . It 's also a kickass action movie.<br /><br />Opening with a liberal , female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums ( the scene which prompts the famous , " Go ahead , make my day " line ) , " Sudden Impact " is one non - stop roller coaster of an action film . The first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome Inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood . It gets only better from there with an over - the - top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past . Superb direction and photography and a at - times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the ' 80 's .
1 Main theme in this Dirty Harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold . Sandra Locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful . Locke is an " 8 " normally , but , with a deadly pistol in her purse , " cocked " for the bad guys , she climbs all the way up the scale to a " 10 " . Having been gang - raped , along with her younger sister , some years ago , Locke , as Jennifer Spencer , has tried to block out the attack from her life , as best she can . Her sister , tho , is almost comatose as a result of the trauma , so the memory is never far from her mind . One day , Jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in S.F. ; she buys a pistol , follows him to a bar , lets him pick her up , then when they 're alone in his Cadillac , beginning to make love , she shoots him .... once in the genitals , once in the brain - - this in the opening scene ! ! Ya got ta love this spunky lady . She 's got her priorities straight . Plus , Jennifer is a professional artist , putting all her anger on canvas UNTIL NOW . After executing her first perp , Jennifer curiously watches Det . Insp . Harry Callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the Caddy . Then , she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street , visits her sister in a nursing home , then goes a'hunting in San Paolo , CA " up the coast " where the rape event took place years ago . With more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind , our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall , as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist . Not uncommon to us right- wingers , when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal , do n't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity , we REMEMBER the CRIME and the SUFFERING he inflicted . Such recalled events steels Jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals , once in the brain . Throughout the movie , scenes of Jennifer 's revenge are interspersed with good , IL ' Dirty Harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop , remember " Go ahead . MAKE my day . " ? Later on , he threatens to step on a punk kid ( who 'd just insulted Callahan ) in a courthouse elevator like he 'd step on dog- s**t .... leaving a young female govt employee staring after Clint as if to say " I want to have your baby . " My favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action , when Harry threatens and frightens a murderous Mafia boss named Threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter 's wedding reception at the Mark Hopkins hotel . Michael Grazzo ( Pantangeli in Godfather II ) does a wonderful job as the sinful Mafia Don , even if he 's only in one scene , dying in a most - convincing manner . However , Harry 's troubles are n't over with yet ! The elevator punk 's gang AND Threlkis ' henchmen each attempt to assassinate Harry in two close - ordered scenes , and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly . Yup , some of the gun - play comes off as uninspired screen violence .... looking like Clint the Director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie . But , there 's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets . The punk kids die much more creatively , though , as they both burn to death and drown in S.F. Bay . Warms my heart . With so much violent intent directed at Insp . Callahan , his bosses send him to San Paolo to try to get some background on the " 22 caliber vasectomy killing " as Jennifer Spencer 's crime is now known , but not before Harry delivers one of his famous sermons - to - the- chowder - headed - liberals . Love that Harry . While our hero ' up annoying the local cops and citizens in San Paolo , two more murders happen , same M.O. , on a sleazy , lazy fisherman and on an equally - creepy hardware entrepreneur . Then Harry meets Jennifer ! They find they both agree on subjects such as Law and Order , Making the Guilty Pay , etc . Could a hot , love scene be in the offing soon ? We 're led to believe just that . Characters abound in this Real - Man meets Real - Woman crime drama , and we get to meet a brassy bull - dyke named Raye Parkins who 's both irritating and entertaining . Raye set up Jennifer 's rape for her " boyfriend " years before , and she 'll get hers eventually . The San Paolo Police Chief , played by reliable Eastwood co - star Pat Hingle ( the Hanging Judge in ' Hang Em High ' ) , is strangely at odds with Callahan 's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies , until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists . Much like Jennifer 's sister , Chief Janning 's son is now a comatose adult , but driven mad by guilt . It ca n't end here , though . The dyke 's rapist boyfriend , Mick , now a kinky - sex jerk of a criminal , drives in from Vegas becuz Raye 's dropped a dime on Jennifer , summoning him up to San Paolo to prevent more executions . Mick sleeps at Raye 's house , but his timing is all wrong , and he 's arrested before he can spend more time with Raye , mostly due to the fact that she 's since been sent to the Island of the Eternal Lesboes by a shot from Jennifer 's revolver . Psycho Mick makes bail at long last , with Jennifer gunning for him . A desperate chase ensues , as Harry tries to keep these two from killing each other . It all turns out well in the end , with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful Roberta Flack blues song .
1 This two - parter was excellent - the best since the series returned . Sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films , but what TV shows do n't do that these days . What we got here was a cracking good sci - fi story . A great big ( really scary ) monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit , some superb aliens in The Ood - the best " new " aliens the revived series has come up with , a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters ( complete with a couple of unnamed " expendable " security people in true Star Trek fashion ) , some large - scale philosophical themes ( love , loyalty , faith , etc . ) , and some top - drawer special effects.<br /><br />I loved every minute of this .
1 In all truth , this really is n't a " movie " so much as an extended final episode ; by this I mean that , had you NOT followed the TV series ( Homicide : Life On The Street ) I suspect that you would have a hard time following this made - for - tv movie . Having said that , " Homicide : The Movie " is still a great watch . I think it says a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return , many after years of absence , to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program . The movie brings out that sense of " family " , not only amongst the characters , but amongst the actors , as well . It 's all very bitter - sweet knowing that this will be the LAST time we will see them all together again under the title of HOMICIDE . Story - wise , I found this film somewhat lacking . Giardello 's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived , and I felt his shooting could 've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position , as Leiutenant . Also , Det . Bayliss 's extreme plot twist , which was left hanging at series end , is finally resolved , but I , for one , NEVER felt that it needed to be ; I enjoyed being left with a mystery ( let us recall that the very first episode 's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run ! ) . As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this movie , and the fact that it even got made after H : LOTS had been canceled , but I would not recommend it to anyone who has n't had the slightest exposure to the series . Now , if they 'd just release it on DVD ...
1 What can I say ? An excellent end to an excellent series ! It never quite got the exposure it deserved in Asia , but by far , the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison . EVER ! The end of a great era . Sorry to see you go ...
1 Homicide : The Movie proved to be a good wrap - up to a well - written , well - directed , and well - acted series . Loose ends were tied up that were n't properly addressed at the end of the final season . The entire series , and especially the movie , provided a life - like look at life ( and death ) in Baltimore , a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate . My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore , but once I experienced life here for myself , I realized how realistic it was . And the movie certainly retained that spirit . I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series , but am very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of Charm City .
1 Following a roughly 7 year rocky road on NBC , it was decided to do just one last Super Installment . The Series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block - buster of a TV hour . It had always had a sizable , hard core of hard corps of followers . < br /><br />It was almost as if the series with the full title of " HOMICIDE : LIFE ON THE STREET " ( 1993 - 99 ) was a sort of " Mr. In - Between " of series . It was too big to just cancel , but too small to get a case of ' Rabid Ratings Ravings ' over . < br /><br />During the precarious tenure on Friday evenings , they had presented some of the best and most daringly Artistic of Hourly Dramas . There , I 've said it Artistic , Artistic ! ! But please , remember we mean Artistic , but not just Phony , Pretentious , Pedantic , Politically Correct preaching.<br /><br />When at last , it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for " HOMICIDE " ; this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for TV Movie . < br /><br />Looking at all the past seasons ' happenings and parade of regular characters , the Production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off.<br /><br />OUR STORY  . As we join the story , we find that Baltimore Homicide Unit Commanding Officer , Lt . Al Giardello has " pulled the pin " , Retired from the job , that is . But ' G ' is n't ready to really retire - retire yet . So , instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod , we find that Al is running for Mayor of ' Charm City.'<br /><br />While out in the City , making some campaign stops and speeches , the former Detective Lieutenant takes an assassin 's bullet . Alive , but in a comatose state , he is taken to the Hospital . < br /><br />News spreads quickly and as if officially summoned , we find all of the Detectives of the Baltimore Unit we 've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance . There is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead.<br /><br />The Producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story . They managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones . The whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way . But at least for now , we 'll leave that as " classified".<br /><br />In wrapping up everything into a neat , little package , this TV Movie surely gets our endorsement . As for grading " THE HOMICIDE MOVIE " , we must give it an A or A+ , even . But , no matter the Grade here , it did n't score as high as a typical weekly episode .
1 My favourite police series of all time turns to a TV - film . Does it work ? Yes . Gee runs for mayor and gets shot . The Homicide " hall of fame " turns up . Pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series . A lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the TV - series but it amuses the fans too . The last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up . And a short appearance from my favourite coroner Juliana Cox . This is a good film .
1 The movie was excellent , save for some of the scenes with Esposito . I enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series , and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series ( thanks to NBC ... ) . It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together at their most human , and most basic persons . Braugher and Secor did a great job , but as usual will get overlooked . It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide . Memories , tapes , and reruns on CourtTV just are n't the same as watching it come on every Friday . But the movie did its job and did it very well , presenting a great depiction of life after Al retired , and the family relationship that existed between the unit . I enjoyed this a lot .
1 For anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch . However , it also leaves you wanting more . I loved the way that every character ( detective)made an appearance . Least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie . My guess is Bayless of course . This like the series was a very well put together series of scenes . This is a series I wish had lived on . Thanks to the cast for some wonderful TV .
1 This is the final episode we deserved . At the end of the last season , things were left in a ' life goes on ' mood , which was hardly the wrap - up that this realistic series deserved . While not a happy show , this series was always one that made you think ( a rare thing on television ) , and this is no exception . ' Is death justified by reasoning ? ' ' Are morals reflective of society , or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ? ' ' What is a just death , and can it exist ? ' All of these questions , and more , are posed by the writers of this show every week , and this is their final thesis . Fine acting , great writing , wonderful camera - work , brilliant editing , clean direction . If you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran , then get a hold on a copy somehow . If you never watched the series when it ran , then this will stand up on its own , but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts . For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons , this is very satisfying viewing .
1 For all the Homicide junkies out there , this movie was great ! Every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie . It helped to resolve some ( but not all ) issues from the series . Unfortunately , unless you actually did watch the series , most of the enjoyment would be lost , as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show 's existence . This probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie , but we got ta take what we can get . I hope they make more movies , and continue to feature Homicide characters on Law and Order .
1 HLOTS was an outstanding series , its what NYPD Blue will never be , on HLOTS the plots are real , the dialog is real , the Relationships are real . With HLOTS back as a movie , Tying up all the loose ends , it was good to have all the gang back together , even a few that passed away show up ( wo nt say how ) The storyline was fast paced , emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out . Homicide , Life on the Streets , Network drama at Its BEST ! ! ! ! 5 STARS ! ! ! ! Thumbs UP and all That . Thanks NBC for giving us the Finally we did n't get !
1 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Well , seeing as I am a major H : LOTS fan , maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would . However , this movie is still excellent . It had tons of surprises , and it gave some more closure to the series . While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer , the overall feeling I felt was satisfied .
1 Not only was this movie better than all the final season of H : LOTS . But it was better than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Looking at the " Top 250 " I see that only one small screen movie has made it : How the Grinch Stole Christmas . I think it is time to increase that group to 2.<br /><br />I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this , but I did n't mind . I just LOVED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again !
1 Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that were n't exactly true to character , this was Classic H : LOTS . The characters , outside of Mike Giardello ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , were true to form , and the reunion scenes of Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) and Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen.<br /><br />"Homicide : The Movie " aka " Life Everlasting " is a fan flick , but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series . Fontana , Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of " the best damn show on television " together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it . True to " Homicide " form , there were no happy endings , such is life . That 's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie - cutter cop shows left on television . Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike.<br /><br / > * * I call myself a " Homicidal Maniac " if for no other reason than to keep my co - workers in a cooperative mood . * *
1 I have always been a fan of the show so I 'll admit that I am biased . When the show 's run ended , I felt like too many questions remained unanswered . This movie to me felt like closure . To see all the people I 'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding . I have heard that this is probably the only Homicide movie that we can expect . If that is so , this is the appropriate way to go out . This movie is sometimes poignant , sometimes upsetting , but always satisfying . If you are or ever have been a fan of the show , watch this movie .
1 The acting in this movie was superb , but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa made it heart wrenching . It was good that the writer isolated Boesman and Lena from others run from their homes , so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats ; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart . Worth seeing when you put the movie in it 's proper context .
1 I did not read anything about the film before I watched it , by chance , last Saturday evening . And then , as I was watching it , I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman into my bones . I was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that I listened only partially to the dialogues . My husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and I was sleepless , under the impact of the film . I wanted to wake him up just to say:"if I would ever vote for an Oscar nomination , it would be for these two actors . " I decided to wait until the next day . Then I read more about the film on IMDb , and was sad to learn that Mr. Berry died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece . I still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film , in its concept and spirit . The actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine , no showing off , well to the contrary , displaying the true image of human depression . Sad but poignant .
1 ] Have n't seen this film ? Have n't even heard of this film ? It would n't surprise me . One of the few truly " independent " films produced in the last ten years , no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution . The independent company Kino Films , gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion , and the majority of major film critics did n't even bother reviewing it . I guess a movie based on a one act , one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today 's market - and it 's the intelligent film - lover 's loss.<br /><br />For the record , both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar nominations ( as did the cinematographer ) but the film received such little fanfare that I ca n't even blame the academy on that one . This is a film that is challenging , thought - provoking , and heartbreaking , and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it 's own terms . Taking that into consideration , it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment . Director John Berry wisely does not attempt to dress - up Athol Fugard 's play . Sure , we 're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots , but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains , on the whole , a story of two people living in inhumane conditions.<br /><br />Stripped of their basic human rights , Boesman ( Glover ) and Lena ( Bassett ) have no one left to attack but each other . A third character joins them for awhile ( Willie Jonah , amazing in a largely silent role ) , but the film 's focus never strays from the title characters and what they 've become . Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple , performances that simply could not be improved upon . Vigorously and brutally stimulating , both intellectually and emotionally , BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered of home video . Hands down , the best film of the year 2000 .
1 It 's always nice to see Angela Bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into . She is at times intense , funny and even sexy in her role as Lena , a " colored " woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of Cape Town , South Africa . Danny Glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner , Boesman . Willie Jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers Boesman and Lena 's new living area . It 's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes . Although it is based on a play , the late director John Berry ( who also directed Claudine ) opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen Cinemascope format . He also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play . Just like Diahann Carroll in Claudine , John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett into an Academy Award nomination . This is definitely a film worth searching for .
1 An absorbing ( although repetitive and rather didactic ) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up , where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option . But even here , in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and no future , that does not work , and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with , a simple act of charity , gives some reward , even if it just makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past.<br /><br />Although there is little actual on screen violence , this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindedness of oppression ( politically and personally ) that does not make for easy entertainment . Clearly based on a play , with a small cast , a broader more expansive relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience .
1 If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series it could have been one of the best . It is good enough , as most of them are , but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point . The situation is unusually intriguing : the farmers in the province have two champions , a benevolent boss ( for once ) and a philosopher - samurai who starts a sort of Grange ; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters , who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land ; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites . ( He also resembles Dracula , as the villains in the later Zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do . ) These characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against Zatoichi as he was drawn originally , but by now he has lost many of his nuances , and the changes in some of the characters , such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man Zatoichi has killed , need more time then the movie has to give , so that the story seems choppy , as if some scenes were missing . Other than that , the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series : good acting , sometimes lyrical photography , the creation of a vivid , believable , and uniquely recognizable landscape ( the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it ) , and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself : the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist . And of course there is the keynote actor , whose presence , as much as his performance , makes it all work . This must be one of the best - sustained series in movie history .
1 This is one of the oddest films of the Zatôichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that Ichi plays in the film . Interestingly enough , this was the first Zatôichi film made by Shintaro Katsu 's new production company . Now , instead of just playing the blind swordsman , Katsu is in charge of making the films . This could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films . As far as Ichi 's role , the film is very different because he is n't in the film as much as usual . He 's also easy to fool and actually , for a while , does a lot to harm people instead of helping ! < br /><br />"Zatôichi Rôyaburi " begins with Ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness . Oddly , in this scene , Ichi says that he 's been blind since a toddler , though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8 . This is a minor mistake , and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed.<br /><br />This film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year -- so you can see what I said about odd pacing . Most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks . Ichi comes to a town where there is a boss ( Asagoro ) who tries very hard to be nice to Ichi because he knows of the blind man 's reputation . The boss is quite charming and surprisingly Ichi is totally taken in by the evil man . At the same time , he meets another boss ( Shushui)--a sort of guru to the poor . Shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even Ichi falls under his teaching -- giving up his blade for many months . Shushui 's teachings are very similar to Daoist teachings from China -- non - violence and acceptance of life as it is ( for good or for bad ) . < br /><br />Months after leaving this town and thinking all was well , Ichi learns that as soon as he left , Asagoro showed his true colors -- enslaving women , oppressing the poor and being an all - around jerk . In a way , Ichi is responsible for this , as he helped Asagoro and counted him as a friend . Now , Asagoro has captured Shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss ' actions.<br /><br />When Ichi returns , he does n't accept automatically that Asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly . This bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where , what else , Ichi kills the baddies and frees Shushui . This finale was very good and occurred in the rain . Then final scene with Asagoro and the rocks is great , though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today 's special effects standards.<br /><br />Pluses for the film are that although poorly paced , it is different and can not be mistaken for the previous 15 ( which often seem very similar ) . Additionally , it does end very well . Minuses ( aside from pacing ) are that some might dislike seeing Ichi so fallible and the scenes with Ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat ... very , very , very flat . They are tacky and unfunny ... that 's the sort of flat that it is .
1 Zatoichi The Outlaw was the first film made by its hero 's ( Shintaro Katsu ) own production company , this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series , though it is by no means weak overall . It tells of our hero coming across two towns , rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy , violence and no little interest , all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks . It is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion , but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff . The helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character , upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure , Zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions , whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor . Its a harsh world , with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting , though things are n't as rousing as they could be . Shintaro Katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as Zatoichi , mixing wisdom , deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability , while solid work comes also from Rentarô Mikuni and an effectively baleful Kô Nishimura ( later to appear as Katsu 's superior " Snake " Magobei in the Hanzo trilogy ) as the two main bosses in the film . There is also a good emotional turn from Yuko Hamada as a wronged woman . The film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events , there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost , meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film is n't as exciting as it could be , emotional impact is lost also . The action or scenes of Zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director Satsuo Yamamoto , though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way , without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments . Still , I enjoyed this one , it has its flaws and is n't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment , a good story and decent doses of Zatoichi 's trademark ingenious and quirky cool . Recommended for fans of the series , and a reasonable entry point , classy stuff though not a true great .
1 I finally watched these episodes in 2008 and I had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced . They are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future . Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush or they are those weird , eerie people that pay attention to things . Boo , scary ! Bush 's frat bros invading the White House dressed as Arabs wielding rifles ? Bush ' accidentally ' executing someone ? ( No , wait . He did sort of do that as gov . ) This may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time , but must now be considered as brilliant , if spooky , prescience .
1 That 's My Bush is a live action project made by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone . The show was cancelled after one season , not because of bad reviews(it actually got good reviews ) , but because it was very expensive . That 's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network TV sitcom . It is also a political satire . Now , this is nowhere near as good as South Park , but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire . The guy who plays in that 's my bush looks a lot like him ! If you can find the show , check it out . There are plenty of laughs to be had!<br /><br />9/10
1 That s My Bush is first of all a very entertaining show by Parker and Stone , I thought . Its often very very funny , and its quite subversive and crazy . South Park fans would surely get something here . < br /><br />Another surprise is the production value here . A lot of money must have been put into this , and it shows . A lot of expensive little details . Its not a little show . And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel , but they put a lot into this show obviously . In a way I understand that was the death of the show as well though , too costy . It surely could have been done cheaper and went on the will was there . < br /><br />The critics liked it , and it had its little fanbase , but it failed gaining a big audience . As we know , the show stopped after 8 episodes , which I guess is almost 1 season . < br /><br />As I really liked the show it has its faults . The problem of the show is kind of that it does n't know what it wants to be really . Its like it tries to be a sitcom AND a parody of a sitcom at the same time . The actors do a good job , and some of them are well casted , but in my opinion they seem to not always get 100 % the bizarre humor they 're supposed to present . < br /><br />I personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work . In South Park you have Kyle and Stan , that are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe . I think that s kind of what makes South Park work . You need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way , and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level . If everything is archetypes and stereotypes its difficult to get emotionally included in the show , which really is That s My Bush biggest problem . Kyle and Stan is characters in South Park that makes sense of the insanity in the show . We have nothing like that here , and this show suffers from it . < br /><br />Another anchorpoint is Parker and Stones flirting with republicans . Its the only thing about them I do n't really get what they 're trying to do . Not portraying Bush as nothing else than a dumb Homer Simpsons lovable kind of character IS kind of subversive in a world where a lot of people that ca n't stand him and think he 's the worst president since Nixon , and a parallel comedy world of Letterman and so on that only satirizes his every move ... but its difficult to understand if Parker and Stone actually means anything by it . Its like the joke is on us , but somehow it does n't hit the mark . It seems awkward , because it does n't remind you of the real Bush at all . < br /><br />Besides that I actually thought the show was very enjoyable . Some of the jokes in here are hilarious . The pro - life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show . And the show is packed with great material , and is sometimes insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching it .
1 An extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the Russian Revolution . However , he is not any ordinary extra . He is Serguis Alexander , former commanding general of the Russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene , which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in , to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander . It can now be the time for this broken man to finally " win " his penultimate battle . This is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by Von Sternberg , providing the greatest irony in Alexander 's character in every way he can . Jannings deserved his Oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley . Powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and Brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as Jannings ' love . All around brilliance . Rating , 10 .
1 Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General to the Czar of Russia who has found himself there . Emil Jannings won a well - deserved Oscar , in part , for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a Russian general . The movie flashes back to his days in Russia leading up to the country 's fall to revolutionaries . William Powell makes his big screen debut as the Hollywood director who casts Jannings in his film . The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and at an imitation of behind - the - scenes Tinseltown in the early days . Von Sternberg delivers yet another classic , and one that is filled with the great elements of romance , intrigue , and tragedy .
1 1927 , and Hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade . Now that it had become the site of a multi - million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established , some of those in the calmer quarters of this film - making factory were taking the time for a little self - reflection . The Last Command , while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times , frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality , and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal . It was written by Lajos Biro , who had been on the scene long enough to know.<br /><br />Taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among Hollywood 's most celebrated immigrants  Emil Jannings . Before coming to the States Jannings had worked mainly in comedy , being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well - timed performance , often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has - beens . He makes his entrance in The Last Command as the latter , and at first it looks as if this is to be another of Jannings 's scenery - chomping caricatures . However , as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range , showing by turns delicate frailty , serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale . He never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration ( the German acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety ) , but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance.<br /><br />The director was another immigrant , albeit one who had been around Hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the European film industry . Nevertheless Joseph von Sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious Teutonic Kino Meister ( the " von " was made up , by the way ) , and took a very distinctive approach to the craft . Of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone , a great example being the first of the Russian flashback scenes . We open with a carefully - constructed chaos with movement in converging directions , which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen . Then , when Jannings arrives , everything settles down . Jannings 's performance is incredibly sedate and measured , and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order.<br /><br />Sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence , allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen , and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic . In fact , he really seems to have an all - round lack of interest in action . In the scene of the prisoners ' revolt Sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance , his camera eventually retreating to a fly - on - the - wall position . Compare this to the following scenes between Jannings and Evelyn Brent , which are a complex medley of point - of - view shots and intense close - ups , thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction.<br /><br />As a personality on set , it would seem that Sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by William Powell , and in fact Powell 's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even Sternberg himself would have been in on . Unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with , and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones , the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired . While Jannings displays classic hamming in the Charles Laughton mode that works dramatically , it appears no - one told his co - stars they were not in a comedy . Evelyn Brent is fairly good , giving us some good emoting , but overplaying it here and there . The only performance that comes close to Jannings is that of Powell himself . It 's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of The Thin Man and The Great Ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless , like a male Ninotchka , but he does a good job , revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard - hearted exterior.<br /><br />The Last Command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices , as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film - making process , even a relatively tame example like this . At the very least , I believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the " behind - the - scenes " view , as it threatened the mystique of movie - making which was still very much alive at this point . As it turned out , such was the impact of the picture that Jannings won the first ever Academy Award for Best Actor , as well as a Best Writing nomination for Lajos Biro and ( according to some sources , although the issue is a little vague ) a nomination for Best Picture . This is significant , since the Academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self - indulgent back - slapping by the Hollywood elite . But elite or not , they recognised good material when they saw it , and were willing to reward it .
1 The Last Command ( 1928 ) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg . It shows us Czarist General , Grand Duke Sergius Alexander ( Emil Jannings ) in his days of glory . In 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing . He also had the love of a woman , Natalie Dabrova ( Evelyn Brent).About ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution . His old enemy Lev Andreyev ( William Powell ) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not . The Last Command is very good silent drama . Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead . Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead . William Powell is great as always . There are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie . Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent . And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings . This is a movie that touches in many parts .
1 Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 ( William Powell ) is casting his epic about the Russian revolution , and hires an old ex - general from the Czarist regime ( Emil Jannings ) to play the general of the film , and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared ( Evelyn Brent ) , of 11 years before.<br /><br />Try as I might , I feel it hard to warm to ' The Last Command ' for all its virtues . ' The Docks of New York ' was indubitably a great film , and ' Underworld ' is a film I have always been craving to see , but ' The Last Command ' is rather heavy - going . The premise is fascinating , but the treatment does really make the script come to life , except in the sequences set in Hollywood , depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state - of - the - art technology.<br /><br />Emil Jannings is , predictably , a marvelous Russian general , distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex - general , transfixed in his misery , and the vigorous , hearty officer of yore.<br /><br />The ending is great and worth the wait , but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times .
1 While this movie 's style is n't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been , this is still a very good film . In fact , it was seen as an excellent film in its day , as it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar ( losing to WINGS ) . I still consider WINGS to be a superior film , but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead , Emil Jannings.<br /><br />Jannings is a general from Czarist Russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a Hollywood extra . His luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call -- to play an Imperial Russian general fighting against the Communists during the revolution . Naturally this is n't much of a stretch acting - wise , but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution.<br /><br />Exactly what happens next I 'll leave to you , but it 's a pretty good film -- particularly at the end . By the way , look for William Powell as the Russian director . Despite being made in 1928 , with the makeup he does n't look much younger than he did in many of his later films .
1 One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism , the highly atmospheric style of film - making developed during the 20s in Berlin . Classic movies like " Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari . " ( 1920 ) and " Nosferatu , Eine Symphonie Des Grauens " ( 1922 ) were the most famous direct results of this movement , and while the movement did n't have a long life , its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today , specially in the horror genre . One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener , director of 1920 's " Der Golem , Wie Er in die Welt Kam " , as in his debut as a filmmaker , seven years before the making of that classic , he was already making experiments with expressionism in film . That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally , another horror film : " Der Student Von Prag".<br /><br />"Der Student Von Prag " ( " The Student of Prague " ) , is the story of Balduin ( Paul Wegener ) , a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague , but who always find himself with financial troubles . One day , Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit ( Grete Berger ) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident . Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again , but soon he discovers that he 'll have to compete with her rich cousin , Graf Von Schwarzenberg ( Lothar Körner ) , who also wants to marry her . Knowing that he ca n't offer her much , Balduin wishes to be wealthy , and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli ( John Gottowt ) enters the scene . Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room . Balduin accepts the proposal , only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror.<br /><br />Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe 's short story " William Wilson " and the classic legend of " Faust " , the story of " Der Student Von Prag " was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers , a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature . Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form , " Der Student Von Prag " shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes . Like most of the scriptwriters of his time , Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater , although " Der Student Von Prag " begins to move away from that style . While a bit poor on its character development ( specially on the supporting characters ) , Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin.<br /><br />While " Der Student Von Prag " was Paul Wegener 's directorial debut and Stellan Rye 's second film as a filmmaker , it 's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly . Giving great use to Guido Seeber 's cinematography , the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do . Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his " Golem " series from Seeber and Rye . Despite having very limited resources , Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing ( for its time ) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin 's reflection ( played by Wegener too ) . Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film , Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers.<br /><br />As Balduin , Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie . It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer , but one ca n't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract . John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove . Few is said about Scapinelli in the film , but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared . The rest of the main cast is less lucky , with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit , and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg . However , it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis - Schwarzenberg , showing the dignity that Lörner 's character should have had.<br /><br />Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake ( made 13 years after this film ) is superior in every possible way , it 's not difficult to understand why " Der Student Von Prag " has n't stood the test of time as well as other early films . The movie 's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget , as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers ' story needed to be fully developed . This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times , or even incomplete , as if there was something missing in the narrative ( of course , there 's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete ) . However , " Der Student Von Prag " is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that , while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time , left a powerful impression in history.<br /><br />As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement , it 's hard to deny the enormous importance that " Der Student Von Prag " has in the history of German cinema , probably in the history of cinema in general . It may look dated even for its time , but considering the limited resources its director had , it 's truly better than most films from that era . As the movie that started Paul Wegener 's career , and with that German expressionism , " Der Student Von Prag " is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history . 7/10
1 If " The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari " is the father of all horror films ( and of German expressionist cinema ) , this pre - WWI film is the grandfather . The titular student , starving in an empty garret , makes a deal with the Devil-- the Devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold , in exchange for " anything in this room . " The Devil chooses the student 's reflection in his mirror . He walks off with the student 's doppelganger , who commits crimes for which the student is blamed.<br /><br />The film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking ; the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects , but the film is , of necessity , virtually all shot in shadowless daylight . But the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop.<br /><br />More interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake , The Student of Prague is still worthwhile .
1 ' The Student of Prague ' is an early feature - length horror drama or , rather , it is an " autorenfilm " ( i.e. an author 's film ) . This film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma , or just make a profit , by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen . Fortunately , the story of this book with moving pictures is good . Using Alfred de Musset 's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe , it centres on the doppelgänger theme.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes . Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for his day , but he 's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it . Film scholar Leon Hunt ( printed in " Early Cinema : Space , Frame , Narrative " ) , however , has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme : characters being split by left / right , near / far and frontal / diagonal framing of characters and shots . Regardless , the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position , which is noticeably primitive . Worse is the lack of editing ; there 's very little scene dissection and scenes linger . None of this is unusual for 1913 , but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time , including the better parts of ' Atlantis ' ( August Blom , 1913 ) , ' Twilight of a Woman 's Soul ' ( Yevgeni Bauer , 1913 ) and the short films of D.W. Griffith.<br /><br />An expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake . Furthermore , the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character , other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate . Here , the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around , seemingly , with a cloak of invisibility . I know their world is silent to me , but I assume , with their lips moving and such , that their world would not be silent to them , so how can Lyduschka leer over others ' shoulders and not be noticed?<br /><br />Nevertheless , this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually . Wegener , who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film , in addition to playing the lead , would later play the title role and co - direct ' The Golem ' in 1920 - -helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in German silent cinéma.<br /><br />(Note : The first version I viewed was about an hour long ( surely not quite complete ) and was in poor condition , with faces bleached at times and such . I 'm not sure who was the distributor . I 've also since seen the Alpha DVD , which , at 41 minutes , is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards , but is visually not as bad . The repetitive score is best muted , though . )
1 A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman -- so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense . An evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady 's heart IF he agrees to give him anything he wants that 's within their room . The dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man 's reflection out of the mirror -- and bad things naturally occur as a result.<br /><br />If this film had been made just a decade later , I am sure I would n't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film . After all , the film 's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is , at times , a bit stilted . However , when you consider that in 1913 " full - length " films were rare -- and often only 20 to 30 minutes long ! Plus , the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual -- as stories were very short and broadly acted . So , given the limitations of the time , this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known .
1 Those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on . This is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money . Unfortunately , the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently , tearing his life apart . There are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and , of course , the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time . The middle part is a bit dull , but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer . One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie . Also , they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing . I first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it . I was not disappointed .
1 This early version of the tale ' The Student of Prague ' was made in Germany in 1913 , starring Paul Wegener ( who was also in ' The Golem ' a few years later ) . In this film he plays a dual role ( technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot ) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he 's previously saved from drowning.<br /><br />Moving at a fast pace ( the film runs just over an hour ) and fairly well written and characterised , ' The Student of Prague ' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil , and developing into good and evil sides of the same person .
1 In this truly fascinating , dark film , a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money , in return the devil takes his mirror image ( this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when Balduin , the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror ) , a visual metaphor for a " man at war with himself " which portents his immediate future . The student enjoys his money , but the woman he loves is unattainable ( he has made a pact with the devil , he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul ) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money , you can not have both . Balduin is haunted by his double ( the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action . Some of the scenes are incredible , the sense of doom when the Devil disappears with Balduin 's mirror image is amazing , as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society ( the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the ' wasteland ' at the edge of the town , no longer entirely human ( he has lost his soul ) he is like a hunted animal outside of human society . There are so many other things to say about this incredible film . Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director , a cultural hero of mine . It helps if you know a bit about German history at the time this film was made and about German doppelganger tradition ( do n't google it , get a proper book)Just remember , it 's a very early film , it 's a little clumsy at times , but considering what it has to say and it 's tragic finale , it 's one of the best ever ( yes it Is ! )
1 A good film , and one I 'll watch a number of times . Rich ( the previous commenter)is right : there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards , and I have to wonder how much has suffered in translation . Were there more in the original ? Or was a native - language audience expected to lip - read more ? Or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar ? In short , very worth a look , but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it.<br /><br />The Alpha Video release touts the new organ score , but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way . Sure , it starts promisingly , but degenerates into a repetitive , Phillip - Glass - like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen . After listening for a while , I turned off the sound and simply watched : much better !
1 " It was n't me ! It was , er , my twin brother Rupert ! " Bobby says to Dugan when confronted about being over at Sally 's place . I have used this line dozens of times over the years ( no one has yet to believe it , though).<br /><br />This movie is one of the all - time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability . Steven Oliver was perfect for the part of Dugan , so much so that he was in 1978 's " Malibu Beach " as the same character ( not nearly as much screen time , though).<br /><br />"Nobody calls Dugan a turd ! " is another line for the ages . This classic film was definitely worth the price of admission .
1 ... this is , above all else , the typical Crown International Pictures drive - in ( read " passion pit " ) programmer . The 1975 Sammy Johns hit record " Chevy Van " is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack ( this movie has even been reissued with the title CHEVY VAN ) , despite the film 's title vehicle being a Dodge . Danny DeVito makes only six minutes of on - screen appearance , but countless VHS reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick . The movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale -- will Bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one - night - stand his customised van facilitates , or must he wait until Tina , the girl of his dreams , gives him the time of day ? Still , it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male American high schoolers of the time , and on that basis alone THE VAN has , almost in spite of itself , become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the period 's popular American cinema ...
1 In 1979 , I was a boy of 12 years old , My parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood . As a 12 year old boy , this was the first time I saw boobs on television . I will never forget the joy of those times . Racing vans , the total ass - wipe with the baddest van , the water bed , the smoking of herbs , the hot 70 's chicks , the ' makin love in my Chevy van song , it was all so new to me . A complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for . I own it and enjoy it about once a year . When I watch this movie , it makes me want to get my skates , with 4 wheels , not in a strait line , go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair . truly great memories of young adolescence !
1 I am proud to say I own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70 's Crown International drive - in sexploitation comedy cheese on DVD . It 's a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezy'n'easy 70 's vibe to it . It does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail . Sure , it 's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic -- the main teen goofus character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls , the respect of his friends , and a chance to show - up a local van - racing bully -- but it 's way too dopey and good - natured to hate . Stuart Getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead , Deborah White as the main object of Getz 's affection is a definite cutie , Connie Lisa Marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe , and sneering beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver ( a 60 's biker movie perennial ) is wonderfully hateful as the brutish Dugan Hicks . A pre - stardom Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute riot as Getz 's cranky carwash owner boss Andy , a lovably cantankerous ne'er - do - well slob who wears very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit . I especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny up -- one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over Danny 's torso ! And Sammy Johns ' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week . In short , it 's great groovy retro-70 's fun !
1 Simple - minded but good - natured drive - in movie about a simple - minded but good - natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his " ballroom " . < br /><br />Bobby , our hero , spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams . Joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls Bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor , but he finds out much responsibility , danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel.<br /><br />The Van is a guilty pleasure of mine . It captures the laid back mid 70 's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the " so bad it 's good " category .
1 i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way ! i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched , it . this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format.<br /><br />holy guacamole ! how i wish those days would come again . i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car ( honda civic 1984 ) , but the vacuum formed muffin trays did n't quite cut it . also in my civic , sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in ' the van'.<br /><br />'the van ' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately.<br /><br />i highly anticipate that Sam Grossman ( the director ) has achieved his opus.<br /><br />Ratings john : * * * * 1/2 Sam : * * * * *
1 THE VAN is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it 's way to make you feel comfortable , providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends . Danny Devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show ! All the leads are well acted , the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture . A Crown International Release .
1 Love trap is a " must see " independent film . When I sat down to watch the movie , I came in with low expectations , but left with a blessing . The story is poetic , substantive , and creative . The writer pulls you in further and further which each scene , allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with . The movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider love to be . The movie displayed what love really is , action not emotion . I was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie . The entire presentation surpassed my expectations . I give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds .
1 I picked this film up at my local library . Having met the director at a film festival late last year , I was curious to " check out " his work . I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects , love , infidelity , friendships , jealousy . It can be a bit ' talky ' at times but never so much as to completely sink the film . I enjoyed watching a love story with characters that CLEARLY belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly " falling " into something as important as love.<br /><br />The contrast between this film and the average low - budget shoot - em ' up black film is quite distinct . Check it out . If you 're lucky , your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did . Good stuff !
1 Love Trap is not a short , it 's quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes.<br /><br />While I 'm writing this , I might as well talk a bit more about Love Trap . I 'm frequently asked what makes Love Trap different ... this is how I respond to that question : 1 ) It introduces characters - one in particular - that have never been seen before in film , period.<br /><br />2 ) It reveals more truth about love , and delves more deeply into the very concept of love , than any other U.S. film ever made , in my humble opinion.<br /><br />3 ) Structurally , as in the way the story is told , it is unlike any love story you 've ever seen.<br /><br />4 ) It offers extremely timely insights on various cultural issues , both within and outside the Black community.<br /><br />Over time , people will come to see Love Trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era , delightfully refreshing , authentic and honest . It is a rare morality play full of food for thought.<br /><br />Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate info about this film .
1 A realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me . It has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two . We rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older , non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults.<br /><br />This movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love . In the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse . Typical plot some may say , but this really was unexpected . < br /><br />I found myself rooting for the survival of the couple 's relationship , seeing my own past in their story . Moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances . < br /><br />It 's a bright film that I would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love . Great movie . I 'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection .
1 This movie earned every one of the ten votes I gave it ! Thank you guys for making a movie worth watching . You showed the world , you can still write , direct , produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes . The poetry was awesome as well , hats off to the poets and musicians.<br /><br />I watched it last night , as I fell in love with my darling all over again . I will be adding it to my movie collection today , and recommending it to my friends and family.<br /><br />Please continue to produce quality , do n't worry about the quantity .... <br /><br />Thank you again , and best wishes and blesses to you !
1 Sensual and tough Maria Braun . ( Hanna Schygula ) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him . That 's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison . She carries on with her life , becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent , ambitious , and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary : " I do n't know a thing about business , but I do know what German women want . You might even say I 'm an expert on it " . While climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband , Hermann ( her man ) and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him , for their future happy life together . " Maria Braun " 's style reminds much of melodramas by Fassbinder 's favorite Hollywood director , Douglas Sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany . Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic.<br /><br />8.5/10
1 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * This is without a doubt the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla . Film starts out with Maria ( Schygulla ) and Hermann Braun ( Klaus Lowitsch ) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive . Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that caters to American GI 's and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill ( Greg Eagles ) and they start to see one another on a steady basis . Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill . But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door . He has n't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill 's head and he dies . Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out . The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald ( Ivan Desny ) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job . Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl 's mistress . She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her . Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get over everything that Maria has done since he has been locked up.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />One day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys her own house . Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they 're marriage even though they have been married for some time now . But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it.<br /><br />There are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths . Like in all Fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way . As the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn Germany but as Maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white . The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of Maria . Fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in Germany at that time . Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film . With a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status . Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants . She 's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive . Schygulla was n't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time . Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke . I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Maria purposely left the gas on . Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad . This is only speculation and if you think I 'm wrong please e - mail me . I think she was overly excited by Hermann being home and left it on by accident ( Remember her putting on a dress for no reason ? ) . Then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing . That s the reason for the bathroom scene . So when the house explodes its by accident . But I think the reason for Fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living . Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate . In his view Maria ca n't have it both ways . A fascinating film .
1 Maria Braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband Hermann . An explosion ripped through the building , to begin with , and she and Hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of rubble on the street . Perhaps this may strike some as a heavy - handed metaphor for what 's about to come : marriage on the rocks , so to speak . It 's a betrothal where the husband goes off to war and is held in a Russian prison camp , unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud Maria , who keeps standing by the depressing rubble of the train station as some come home , others do n't , with a sign awaiting Hermann.<br /><br />Trouble arises , as happens in Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's melodramas , and as its one of his best and most provocative , we see as Maria ( uncommonly gorgeous Hanna Schygulla in this role ) will do a two - face : she 'll stand by her man , even if it means working at a bar for American GI 's and , even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that Hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black GI and comes close to bearing his child ( that is , naturally , until he reappears and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe ) , or working for a German businessman ( effectively sympathetic Ivan Desny ) and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company . Maria will do whatever it takes to be successful , but she 'll always be married.<br /><br />It 's hard to say there 's anything about Maria that is n't fascinating . Money , sex , power , all of these become interchangeable for Maria . She 's like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a sultry smile : she gets to have a husband , more or less ( actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film ) while obtaining things- a man who dotes on her whenever he can , a new and expensive house with servants , a secretary , money- that others around her are n't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere ( such as the secretary , played interestingly enough by Fassbinder 's own mother).<br /><br />Maria is sexy , confident , and all alone , with an idealized life going against a life that should be made in the shade . She says of the two men- the American soldier and poor old and sick Oswald- that she 's fond of them , and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and soul - searching husband Hermann sends from Canada , after being released from prison . She 's casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce , but understand where she 's coming from and going all the way.<br /><br />Fassbinder employs this inherent contradiction , and moments with Maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama ( for example , Hermann walking in on the jubilant and half - naked Maria and GI is just about a masterpiece of a scene , with Maria 's reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he 's there let alone alive ) , while sticking to his guns as a director of such high - minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable . But it is n't really . It 's like one big metaphor for a country that , after the war , could n't really move on to normalcy . A few times Fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background , and we see Maria walking around her family house , hustle and bustle going on around her , and the radio speaks of a divided Germany , of things still very unsettled , of a disarray . Maybe the only way to cope is excess , or maybe that 's just my interpretation of it.<br /><br />It 's hard to tell , really , under Schygulla 's stare face and eyes , anyway . It 's such an incredible performance , really , one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old - time Hollywood female star while with the down - and - dirty ethic of a girl of the streets . Most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband , where she stars in one of those super - lustful black lingerie pieces and high heels , and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it . That 's almost the essence of what Maria is , and Schygulla wonderfully gets it down , a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her , sometimes in a single sentence . This is what Fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his " trilogy " ; while I might overall prefer Veronika Voss as a masterpiece , Maria Braun is perhaps just as good as a character study , of what makes a woman tick and tock with ( almost ) nothing to lose .
1 The Marriage of Maria Braun ( MMB ) is about a German girl ( Maria ) getting married to a German soldier ( Herman Braun ) just at the ending of the war . After being married for half a day and a night , Herman is send to the front again . To make ends meet , Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier . She got word that Herman died at the front , and things develop between her and the American soldier . Herman walks in on them , in bed , and after a confrontation between him and the American , Maria killed the American . Herman admits to the murder , ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him . The country is in shambles ; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette . There are food shortages . It is in short , a time of survival of the fittest . < br /><br />Basically this film projects Maria 's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances , as a metaphor for Germany 's loss of soul after they lost the war , and how it proceeds to rebuild itself . For example , Maria has the following conversation with a peddler ( played by Fassbinder himself ) ; the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that " Kleist burns out to quickly , it does not provide enough heat for the cold " . The peddler answers " That 's another way to look at it . Right now , it 's probably the correct way " . < br /><br />Maria meets a French / German business man , Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment . She decides to get involve with Karl , " You 're not having an affair with me ; I 'm having an affair with you " . She also takes responsibility in the company , and after a while has the complete trust of the firm . When Karl says " I suppose we 'll just have to wait for a miracle " she replies " I prefer making miracles  then wait for them " . In her own words , she has become the " Mata Hari of the economic miracle".<br /><br />In a lot of Fassbinder 's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms ( see Freud ) ; in other words , he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh*t , the false social mechanisms , the pretending . The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology . For example , she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point " I need someone to sleep with " . As Fassbinder said " the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society " . He also remarked that his films are anti emotional . < br /><br />I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant ( apparently , frequently visited by Hitler himself ) . Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side , as if Maria 's ' brutal honesty ' wears him out , as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore . Karl says " I have to tell myself over and over that I love life " . Maria replies " That 's life is n't it . As if we signed a contract to enjoy life . And then we go out to eat and talk about food " . I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships , to never submit completely to anyone . And why would you , if the central matter of most of his films is about " What love becomes in this society  a commodity , an instrument of power , a weapon." < br /><br />It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period . What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes , when you feel bad , that " you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great " . But , Fassbinder was not interested in perfection . Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project . Since he completed films ( approximately 4 a year ) the way other people rolled cigarettes , it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes . Peter Marthesheimer , who wrote most of the script , mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park , overnight . < br /><br />Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria . Mostly , she just stares bluntly into the camera . In Maria 's own words " It is a bad time for emotions . But , I like it like that " . < br /><br />There are different opinions about the end . After Karl died of a hart attack , Herman finally shows up . ( Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison , to " become human again " . ) After the testament is delivered ( made out to her and Herman in half ) , Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette , and blow her and Herman up . For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident . At the same time , she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true . She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore . She felt as if she had outlived herself .
1 This film exhibits artful cinematic techniques wherein instead of landscape capturing the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears , how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet . How the husband may be wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable . How provocative the woman is posed is another feature of the tableau that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit sexually and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling . The relationship between the wife and husband is unique . It is an open one wherein she holds nothing back , feels no particular shame for how she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus always is on the fact of their marriage . Nothing and no one can come between the two of them . Only the chances of fate can intervene --- his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return at long last . A very intriguing film which is totally absorbing .
1 Fassbinder 's most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long , mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations ; here , it 's much more overt , since the story takes place in war - torn Germany at the end of WWII , and the central character is a woman ( Hanna Schygulla as Maria ) who capitalizes on vulnerabilities ( both economic and gender - related ) to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp . that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers ( as she once was ) . Married amidst allied air raids , Maria and her new husband Herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he 's shipped out to the Russian front . In his absence , her despair is great : she spends most days at the train station , waiting for him to return . When he is reported dead , she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid / prostitute at a brothel catering to American GI's.<br /><br />When he returns , things get plenty messy , as circumstances ( and his sense of noble self - sacrifice ) conspire to keep them apart . The message is Fassbinder 's M.O. writ large : ' Love is colder than death , ' but not only is Maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her , but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel . Fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post - war Germany selling out to the highest bidder , but as with all his films , I tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display : Fassbinder 's as evoked through his characters ; his actors ' as filtered through their real - life connections with Fassbinder . Taken together , his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric , often at once ; this falls somewhere in - between , although definitely closer to the latter . While I did n't like it quite as much as The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant or Katzelmacher , Maria Braun certainly has a greater scope and what 's more , I could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions .
1 My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience . Film and alternative cinema ( small hall , with uncomfortable seats ; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.<br /><br />There were many cliches used in the film , but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing . Sound was also brilliant ( sometimes back being louder than dialogue).<br /><br />Everything seemed to be in right place . And I loved the way how after - war - time was presented . Real fun!<br /><br / >
1 This is the best of the 43 films that Rainer Werner Fassbinder made ; his most successful at least . He was one of the leading directors in the New Germany after WWII.<br /><br />Hanna Schygulla was magnificent as the cold , calculating Maria Bruan , who lost her husband to the War , found him after she took an American soldier as a lover , lost him again after he went to jail for her , and found him agin at the end . Her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end.<br /><br />Such is life . Things come and go , and you do the best you can . You can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive . Even though Maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do , she never stopped loving Hermann , which makes the end such a tragedy.<br /><br />Excellent drama .
1 Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly , despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility . She will do everything to make her marriage work , including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation . And thus beneath the vicey exterior , she reveals a rather sweet value system . The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate , with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with ' and then I woke up ' . It is also book - ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I 've ever seen , but do n't let any of that put you off .
1 This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola , but less of the magic of Veronica Voss . The political musings have point to them : we see the shortages after the war , how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day - to - day life ( delicious moment when Fassbinder , playing a grifter , tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla , who remarks that burning books do n't provide much warmth : she really wants firewood).<br /><br />There 's some clumsiness in the first hour . The scene in Maria 's room with the black soldier , interrupted by Hermann 's appearance should go quicker . The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI -- I cringed , it was so bad . But as the story develops and the years go by , I was drawn more and more into this glossy , cold world .
1 So one person says , " This movie is a beautiful , delicate exploration of West German life after World War II . " And the other says , " Former Nazis living in bombed out buildings , and the movie is ' beautiful , delicate ' ? " And the first sits there nodding , takes another sip of coffee . " I ca n't explain . Just see it . "
1 This film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason . Probably just by the mass populace . Anyhow , this is actually a very interesting movie . The film is an under - budget sci - fi movie which actually works , due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes . < br /><br />This movie may not be for everyone though . If there are any Sci - Fi fans reading this , I truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction . The film has crazy ideas . The setting includes nations going to war with GIGANTIC machines which the entire countries invest all it 's money in ! The world has been divied up into territories . Anyone can challenge anyone else to a war , or rather , a ' robot - duel ' . The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war , since now everyone is wearing those breath masks . Definetly a movie that makes you think . Intelligent , well written , and good effects for the measly budget.<br /><br />I tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work .
1 I read somewhere ( in a fairly panning review ) that this is something of a live - action mecha anime , and I think they 're on the right lines . I first watched this movie when I was very young and I 've been dying to see it again , and when I finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back . I do n't think this is to be taken too seriously - it 's just a bit of good old 80 's almost - a - TV - movie fun ( it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future , although this point is n't stressed too much ) . What I admired most about this movie was that the dialogue did n't sound generic - no clichés , no predictable lines - all in all just good fun ! Maybe time has n't been kind to this little movie , but still I can find appreciation for it in me . It 's by no means perfect , but it 's entertaining and does n't try to be anything other than that . Let the nerds and comic - store - guys worry about technicalities - who cares ? See it for yourself and make your own decision . No - one else 's opinion matters .
1 Robot Jox tries hard , but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot , man against man , man against woman . The premise had potential , but it seems the script was n't really given the couple of more drafts it needed . Still , it was fairly good , for a science fiction action movie . Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman . For those who are n't familiar with the name , Haldeman wrote the award - winning science fiction novel " The Forever War . " It 's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels , right up there with Robert Heinlein 's " Starship Troopers " and John Steakley 's " Armor . " And this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie , rather than giant robots . It 's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was Paul Verhoeven 's " Starship Troopers , " which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on.<br /><br />Despite some assumptions , this really is n't based on Homer 's " Iliad . " A couple of names are all they had in common . Achilles having his robot 's foot blown off had no parallel in the Iliad , which did n't include Achilles ' death . Nor was the ancient Achilles a noble warrior . He was the mightiest , but also vengeful and petty . Even the robot jock killed off in the first scene does n't fit . He was named Hercules , while the Greek Iliad would have had Herakles.<br /><br />The effects were fairly good for the time and the budget . True , it was n't comparable to " Terminator 2 " a year later , but that movie cost ten times as much . The stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in " The Empire Strikes Back " and " Return of the Jedi . " Better , in fact , than a lot of Ray Harryhausen animation , which is highly regarded , but quite dated.<br /><br />Don't bring high expectations into this and you probably wo n't be disappointed . It 's better than a lot of other low - budget flicks and even some big - budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts .
1 If you like mech war games it 's pretty good . Some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing . I 've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I 've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs . If you like the genera then games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to spare Steel Battalion . The movie is worth seeing at least once . There really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there . Less remakes and more original works . < br /><br />Enjoy
1 This movie i 've loved since i was young ! Its excellent . Although , it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one ca n't interpret certain subtleties in the film ( for example , our hero 's name is Achilles , and in the final battle between him and Alexander he 's shot in the heel with a rocket , just as Achilles in mythology was shot in his heel ) . That 's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing ! Anyway , great movie , good story , it 'd be neat to see it redone with today 's special effects ! Oddly enough , Gary Graham had average success , starring in the T.V. show Alien Nation . This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated !
1 Now I 've always been a fan of Full Moon 's puppet work . But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of there better projects . Yes , you heard me . The story works wonderful , the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job . Gary Graham who really makes his mark on TV in shows like ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name . The stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better . The color was wrong , they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be . But that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the Robot Jox , if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies , then you will like this movie . 9 STARS OUT OF 10 .
1 I remember this movie from when i was 12 , it was amazing .. i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then , i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh*t ! Anyway , the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real B movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch , i must have watched it about 20 times . It was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots , pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off " Crash and Burn " , do n't watch that movie by the way it is total pants ! If your a real Sci - Fi movie fan then watch this , if it was re - made today it would be a winner .. i really would love to see a remake or even release the DVD of it .
1 What a great film it is . The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky . The ending is not just a fitting one , it 's more inspirational.<br /><br />But I am intrigued by the characters . It is a pity we never see the relationship of Achilles and Athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and Athena 's fear for Achilles 's safety . Their romance is very enjoyable.<br /><br / >
1 My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots . So I try to seek out movies that have robots . And this movie has robots . Big ones . They beat the clang and bang out of each other , with the fate of nations hanging in the balance . It 's really cool . You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget . It is very hard to dislike this movie . Because of those big robots . They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers ! It made my girlfriend smile . And that is good enough for me . And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo : as the maniacal Russian Villain , whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they 've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste " like blood " ( a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub - Bela Lugosi accent ) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on - screen . This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation .
1 One of the best movies out there . Yeah maybe the cinematography was n't the greatest , but an excellent plot and concept . Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas . Something different from the usual movies and great fun . One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies . Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots , the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while . The sets are not amazing , but simple and worked for the overall look of the film . This movie is very hard to find on DVD , but also on VHS . Check it out cause I have loved it since it came out . Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you 've ever seen . Take a look and think like a child . It 's a great view and very fun .
1 < br /><br />Robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age . You have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you ca nt moan to much about the bad parts . So just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it .
1 OK , this movie was cool . I do n't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun . My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while , and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard , blow off the dust and pop it in . Enjoyable all the way until the end , but a great concept . This is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy . Judgment is victory for Robot Jox .
1 Note to previous reviewer : This movie is " science - fiction adaptation of the Iliad " according to the screenwriter . So whether the references are painful or not , no apologies , it is the basis for the film . They admit they stole ... though adapted is the P.C. term.<br /><br />Great flick but too short . Probably did n't come out as well as the author , director , or studio wanted , but pretty damn fun . The fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy.<br /><br />A big - budget remake would n't be as fun , and probably would n't do the screenplay any more justice . But it 's fun to dream about the potential there . A DVD release with some meager extras is apparently available but I do n't think it would play on NTSC players . I 'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out . For now , I live with the VHS incarnation .
1 What a master piece . To take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future . This film is satire of the highest order . In my humble opinion it outranks Dr. Strangelove.<br /><br />The clever naming of the two superpowers , as the Confederation and the Market . Cons being commies and Market , The west ! outstanding . The Clever use of gen Joxs , was ahead of its time . only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering . Robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989.<br /><br />The message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government . This movies screams DON'T DO IT YOU FOOLS YOU'LL KILL US ALL.<br /><br />EXCELLENT 10/10
1 The scenes are fast - paced . the characters are great . I love Anne - Marie Johnson 's acting . I really like the ending . < br /><br />However , I was disappointed that this movie did n't delve deeper into Achilles 's and Athena 's relationship . It only blossomed when they kissed each other .

1 Hrm - I think that line was from the old movie posters.<br /><br />This is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator . Here 's a tip : Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading " In the future ... " is going to be fun . This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.<br /><br />In this case , " In the future ... " means that , instead of fighting wars , nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine , well , that 's never terribly clear , but it 's probably something really important . There are good guys ( obviously capitalists , i.e. " us " ) and bad guys ( Commies ! ) and there are big stop - motion robots.<br /><br />Sadly , the effects budget was pretty slim , so we do n't get to see a lot of the big robots . There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes , and then a big space fight near the end . The space fight is especially nice , as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.<br /><br />With said money now spent , the climactic fight degenerates into ( and I 'm not making this up ) two guys hitting each other with sticks . I can always get a laugh in a bar by re - enacting the final scene , complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.<br /><br />Like I said - it 's dumb . That 's why I bought the tape .
1 The one of the most remarkable sci - fi movies of the millennium . Not only a movie but an incredible future vision , this movie establishes a new standard of s / f movies . hail and kill !
1 after seeing this excellent film over 100 times , i still find new things that blow me away with this movie , great special effects , incredible acting , and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism , and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well . best movie ever ! ! !
1 From the start I knew I would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life . The idea of two giant robots , manned by brilliant humans , fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot I have ever experienced . I ca n't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script . Let 's just just say it compares to both Lord of Rings pictures , combined . The Academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is ..... ROBOT JOX .
1 Yep , you read that right , kids . Michael Bay should 've studied this film before making either of his over hyped , overlong , overly pointless " Transformers " movies . " Robot Jox " is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the " Transformers " crew spent on Megan Fox 's personal trainer.<br /><br />Thankfully , this little robotic gem , initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted Charles and Albert Band 's Empire Pictures studio , seems to have developed a cult following over the years . I fondly remember watching it on VHS during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the Cold War - era politics / stereotypes were already out of date by that time ( just the Bands ' luck that Communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released , eh ? ) , it 's still a pretty damn cool little B - Movie . They really do n't make'em like this anymore , or if they do , they go the Bay route and CGI things to unbearable proportions.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar , here 's the Robo - scoop : We 're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust , large scale " wars " have been outlawed . Disputes between nations are now settled mano - a - mano ( or perhaps that should be machine - o - machine - o ) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized Shogun Warrior style robots . Whichever ' bot walks away from the fight wins for " his " side . Gary Graham ( who would later go on to play Detective Sykes in the " Alien Nation " TV series ) , plays " Achilles , " the greatest Robot Jock in Marketplace ( a.k.a . the good guys ) history . Achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine Robot bouts ( ten being the maximum number of battles before a " Jock " is retired ) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the " Confederation " ( i.e. The Russkies ! ) , the psychotic Alexander ( who is the most over the top " evil Russian " stereotype bad guy since Dolph Lundgren 's infamous turn as Ivan Drago in " Rocky IV " ) . The match is called a draw when Alexander violates the rules with an illegal Robot Move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing Achilles , but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain . A rematch is scheduled to complete the bout , but Achilles simply wants to bow out , hang up his helmet and move on with his life . Rather than violate the Spoiler Rules by revealing much more , I will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns , behind the scenes skullduggery , and other difficulties for Achilles and his fellow " Jox " before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.<br /><br />I hope I 'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction , because it is n't . " Robot Jox " is just plain fun . I 'll grant that it is a bit higher - concept than your average B - grade sci - fi movie , and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known ( especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green - screen trickery ) , it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire / Full Moon Pictures factory . The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion / model techniques , and the sets and costumes do n't look half - assed in the slightest . Empire Pictures and director Stuart ( " Re - Animator " ) Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture . Unfortunately it did n't quite pan out for them ( or the studio ) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal . Bottom line : if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2 + hours , feel free to rent a " Transformers " movie . By the end you 're likely to feel like you 've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game . If you want to have a rock'em , sock'em robot good time , pick up Robot Jox instead .
1 Robot Jox does n't suffer from story or bad effects . I mean , this was 1990 if you know what I 'm talking about . RoboCop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the ' 80s . If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period , most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time . It was n't until Terminator 2 : Judgment Day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized , and story boarders began to use that motive . But you 'll have fond memories of Transformers , Gundam Wing , even Power Rangers , if you watch this film . The enemy robot is very menacing . It makes you not want to face the man without a really good back - up plan . And there are some great moments within this film . A traitor / spy is working within their midsts . Who you think is on your side , backing you up all the way , could be the person you did n't expect him / her to be . And that 's very troublesome to think so , do n't you agree ?
1 This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies : Although his majesty , Mr. Kinski , is missing you still have young Joachim ' Blacky ' Fuchsberger , starring once again as the typical clever American ' womanizer ' , you have young Eddi Arendt in his best ( and just as well typical ) role ever - the cool , sophisticated British butler - and you have ( not so young anymore ) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very ' dry ' ironic ( and thus : highly entertaining ) police investigator . Furthermore you 'll get offered a freakish and very campy ' evil guy ' behind a frog mask ( hence the movie 's title ! ) , you 'll get a crazed - out swinging soundtrack , classic b - movie action scenes , partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives ( please remind the time of its origin ! ) , yelling scream queens , and on and on ... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin ' cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended ! !
1 Updated version of a story that had been turned into the film in 1938 England(Return of the Frog ) concerning the pursuit by the police of a master criminal known as the Frog because of the frog like get up ( bulging eyes etc ) he wears.<br /><br />One of the good Wallace films from the 1960 's it 's a solid little entertainment . Clearly influenced by ( or did this influence ) the restart of the Dr Mabuse films , the Frog seems to be more a super villain than a master thief . While not the best of the Wallace films , it is worth a look . It would make an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film.<br /><br />Between 6 and 7 out of 10 .
1 I had mixed feelings for " Les Valseuses " ( 1974 ) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up liking it . I would not call it vulgar ( " Dumb and Dumber " is vulgar , " The Sweetest Thing " is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid ) ; I would call it shocking and offensive . I can understand why many viewers , especially , the females would not like or even hate it . It is the epitome of misogyny ( or so it seems ) , and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they 'd meet seems unspeakable . But the more I think of it the more I realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem . I am fascinated how Blier was able to get away with it . The movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable : it is well written , the acting by all is first - class , and the music is sweet and melancholic . Actually , when I think of it , two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to : they prepared a woman in the train ( the lovely , docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in René Clément 's " Forbidden Games"(1952 ) at age 6 ) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months ; they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid Marie - Ange ( Miou - Miou ) exited and satisfied ; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert ( in one of her early screen appearances . ) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level . In short , I am not sure I 'd like to meet Gérard Depardieu 's Jean - Claude and Patrick Dewaere 's Pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring .
1 This is one a most famous movies of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies , starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles . It is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies / eighties , such as " Serie Noire " , " Buffet Froid " , " Beau Pere " , all realized by Blier.<br /><br />However , I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie : the translated title in English is very far from the French version . It is true that both protagonists are " going places " , but the title in French could be literally translated by " the waltz dancers " , which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles ...
1 Bertrand Blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of French cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public . Filmed with his fave duo ( Depardieu and Dewaere ) and the usual dose of sex ( Miou - Miou plays her typical role , at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best French actress ever ) . In first " Les Valseuses " is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals . Those who only are satisfied with family life , or simply know nothing more , the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that , it just let you think of all the usual things in life ( working for the car , being bounded at work etc . ) . It 's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we 're living in . Great job and it just makes you wish two things : Dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course Depardieu , he 'd better should have stuck with French movies as he proves here that no one can beat him . Timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some ...
1 Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they do n't understand them . Simply because they are different kinds of people.<br /><br />If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here.<br /><br />And also the film of blier can not be classified easily as black - comedy or cult etc . like those of pulp fiction etc . Because there is this delicacy which the audience of north - america frequently fail to appreciate.<br /><br />When I looked at these two ` hooligans ' dining with Jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant , I felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been.<br /><br />The urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being - symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the Carrefour.<br /><br />SO , les valseuses is much better a name than going places . To dance a valse you need to be elegant , but going places you do n't .
1 A wonderful , free flowing , often lyrical film that whisks you along , ever smiling , even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way . One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well . This is possibly Depardieu 's best performance , certainly his most natural . Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age . Miou - Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play . Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant / romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges . In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect .
1 Not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not , so beware:<br /><br />Just a small but crucial thing to watch for , an intriguing possibility : the boys steal a green Citroen at one point , for a joy ride , and return it to the owner having done purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car , hoping that the owner will crash . Is it the very same car they steal much later from the picnicking family ? We know the original owner sold it . They drive off at the end on a dangerous road , one which I understand has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years . A whole new slant to the end of the film.<br /><br />On another matter , this film could have been called " Scent of a Woman " . I do n't recall another film , certainly not American , that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner , much like the " nose " of a fine Bordeaux .
1 The movie has a distinct ( albeit brutish and rough ) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy / lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures , and even when they 're at their most thuggish ( like terrorizing the woman on the train ) , a semi - pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away ( Dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby ) . Blier cuts away from the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere , so we 're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way , that incident is the start of their relative humanization ( so the movie could certainly be read as pro - gay , although it could likely be read as pro - anything you want ) . The movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes , making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty , and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots , some of them are bound to hit .
1 I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series(back when the cable box was built like a keyboard),and it intrigued me . Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted . The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable . They have a good chemistry together & Miou - Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking . A movie like this probably would n't be made in these politically correct times(at least not in the US ) , since it seems to sensationalize things like violence , robbery , & casual sex . This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject . It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I , ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou - Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief .
1 I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 . HBO would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence . Back then it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television ... especially back then . I would love to see it now as an adult where I would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it . It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 . Luckily I had stupid babysitters and party - going parents on the weekends . Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys . Breaking into houses to sniff underwear , feeding on a stranger 's breast milk on a public bus , and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off . A very racy film for the early ' 70s . Until I checked IMDb , I had no idea this movie had such a following . Most people I talk to have never heard of it .
1 This film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years . His performance shocks , entertains , disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless . This film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw , but still is able to convey the mastery of Depardieu . A must - see for any Depardieu fan and by far his best early work .
1 I remember hitch hiking to Spain at 25 , getting a lift from , what turned out to be , two fleeing Italian small crooks . They were doing a lot outside the law , but from the other side carrying a little portrait of Jesus in the pocket for their protection ... Just and unjust , good and bad , criminal and correct where here in a new combination , outside of the categories I used to know . ' Les Valseuses ' gives me , although a film and not real life , a picture close to my own experiences : the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave ' all behind ' and go for the momentous , whatever comes your way , it 's another state of mind and also ' dangerous ' form of life , because , as we all know , there are people who are not ready for this and willing to persecute you for ' stealing ' and so on ... This film touches ' values ' , it 's a story about ' what 's right and wrong ' : morals . It 's resurrection of the individual fighting him/ herself free against the ' false morals ' and conformism ... There 's danger all the way , because , how far can you go with your own ' freedom ' and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people ? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you , put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do , like " stealing " some petrol from a multinational oil company for you fifth hand car ? Les Valseuses re - awakens these questions in me , because morality , in contradiction to the usual ' media message ' , is quite complex ...
1 As with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters . But whilst C + J eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood , this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism . Most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet , despite their deeply un - PC behaviour , everyone emerges smiling . Like C + G , through it all they remain innocents at heart , rebels against the quotidien , the bourgeois , the restrictive . As someone else has commented , I would n't want to know these 2 and it 's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy ( and what there is of that can not be laid at their door ) and thus for that reason , it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth . Dare I say that only the French can get away with films like this . And that is part of their genius .
1 Depardieu 's most notorious film is this ( 1974)groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier . It features many highly sexual scenes verging on an X - rating , including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her Jules and Jim menage a trois with the two hairy French hippies ( Depardieu and Deware ) . There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film ; everything is fair game.<br /><br />It 's very odd that Americans tend to not like this film very much while many French people I 've met consider it a classic . Something about it goes against what Americans have been programmed to ' like.'<br /><br />Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two bitch - slapping , hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities , going around molesting women and committing petty crimes . They 're out for kicks and anti - capitalist , Euro - commie , slacker ' freedom . ' Blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous . Best of all though , is the way the wonderful Stephane Grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters , the deeper subconscious awareness or ' higher ideal ' that motivates all the follies they engage in .
1 About 1986 I saw this movie by accident on TV one night . I was 6 years old . It was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to Do n't Look Now in 1987 . I went to Venice on holiday the next year in silent terror , hoping to god that my parents would n't find out I 'd watched it ! < br /><br />Would I have minded if my parents knew I 'd watched Les Valseuses when I was a kid ? I 'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays , and my mum 's probably disapproving in the afterlife . I do n't know if they 'd want to see it anyway . From the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes I 'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it 's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself . < br /><br />It 's definitely violent . It has a violent view of sex , virtually no acknowledgement of love . Even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation . But the scenario IS very erotic and ( god I 'm so British ) arousing ! Do they suck her breasts for her own good ? That is exploitation . So why am I getting a woody?<br /><br />The fellows go in search of an experienced older woman , find an ex - con , mother - figure ? I do n't know . It ends in a truly gruesome suicide . I described it to my friend JB Nelson , who has Cannibal Holocaust - guts , and he went eeuurrgghh ! No motherly love for this movie , quite the opposite . Mutilation of where the boys began . Why do they shoot the girl in the leg ? Why does she come back to them ? Do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men?<br /><br />I'm thinking of two movies , one of which I wish I 'd never seen , the other makes me wish it was n't such a harsh world . Swept Away / Madonna what a pile of insanity does n't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie i m so enraged i ca nt use punctuation ! Once Upon A Time In America / Leone god why does Noodles do it ? Destroys the path to joy we 've been following him on his whole life . So close to finally finding love with Deborah . Now they are both destroyed . Why Sergio ? Why?<br /><br />There is no rape in Les Valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance , of both sexes . Very honest , no titillation . No fantasy shags , no perfect Hollywood smooth moves . Jokes , yes . But there 's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy . Forget Carry On Shooting A Naked Hairdresser In The Leg Cos She 'll Come Back & You 'll Hook Her Up With Your Ex - con Lover 's Vengeant Son & She 'll Learn How To Cum From Him.<br /><br />Two things I ca n't stand are rape movies and prison movies . Les Valseuses is n't a rape movie ! God nobody 's going to want to watch it now ! It is a brilliant movie !
1 Maybe I 'm being too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie ! I 've seen it so many times , but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again . It 's just a simple romantic comedy , with nothing huge or monumentous that happens . But I 'm a big romantic and this movie * is * romantic . I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins , and Walter Mathau is so funny . The scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has n't seen it . It 's such a clean , good movie - and those are so rare now ! My 20-year - old brother likes this movie , too , so it 's not just a chick - flick . ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh , or if you 're just lonely and need to * watch * a romance , if you yourself ca n't participate in one . It 's a good ' un !
1 I just watched I. Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie . It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world . I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with " Einstein " playing " Twinkle , Twinkle Little Star " on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters . I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career , an especially unique situation for the 1950 's , the time in which this movie is set . ( I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children , so please do n't think I am some staunch women 's libber . ) It 's wonderful how a man who is " only a grease monkey " is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine 's fiance , a clinical behavioral researcher . The message to me is that we are not what we do , but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels . There are so many little gags and one - liners that are almost throwaways if you do n't watch and listen carefully.<br /><br />I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page . In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium , there are 3 instruments ( protractor , ruler , etc . ) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge . In the next camera shot , there only 2 . In the credits on our video , it lists Tony Shaloub 's character as Bob Watters , not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie . It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations , but has lots more substance than many give it credit for . Not only that , what a great cast is assembled here . Watch it and enjoy !
1 I recently saw I.Q. and even though I 'm not a romantic comedy type of gal , I think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch . So many movies in my opinion lack honesty . You know that feeling when you 're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it 's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash ? The story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one . How they stuck together and they tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart . I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love , " nothing is what it seems " . I would recommend this for a Sunday morning.<br /><br />7/10
1 This is one of my all time favorites . It is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy . I really like a film full of good quotes and this has it ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein says to Ed Walters " Are you thinking what I 'm thinking " and Ed says " Now what are the odds of that happening ! " In my opinion , a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it , and with this one , you can ! ! I also really enjoyed Walter M.s way of portraying Einstein . I think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely . There are so many times that I find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as I watch it ! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel - good romantic comedy now and then !
1 Australian Fred Schepisi ( A Cry in the Dark ) directs this comedy/ romance that is fun , relaxing , and set in the spring . You will laugh while watching this movie . Tim Robbins ( Shawshank Redemption , Dead Man Walking ) is an auto mechanic , Ed Walters , with a high IQ , which gets higher with the help of Albert Einstein , Walter Matthau ( Grumpy Old Men ) and his academic friends Nathan , Kurt and Boris . You can tell them by their preppie shoes . Meg Ryan ( Sleepless in Seattle , You 've Got Mail ) is Catherine Boyd , Einstein 's niece who is a competent , but not so confident mathematician . Perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius . She thinks that if she marries someone with a high I.Q. her kids will have a high I.Q. as well , but she does not knows what she wants . Between Tim Robbins cute smile and Meg 's cuteness this is a refreshing movie . I love sweet stories . People all ages should enjoy this movie . Catherine is engaged to the jerk James Moreland , who works in animal behavior , but is very stuffy . This is a love a first sight type situation , between the mechanic and the mathematician . Witty lines and subliminal lines ! The cinematography is nice . Princeton , New Jersey is beautiful in the Spring . With much help from all those brilliant men Catherine falls for Ed , without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic.<br /><br />Favorite Scenes : Ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein , Nathan , Kurt , and Boris . Ed and Einstein riding on the motorcycle . Nathan , Kurt and Boris letting all the research animals free!<br /><br />Favorite Quotes : Albert Einstein : " Do n't let your brain interfere with your heart " . Ed Walters : " When was the last time he said " Wahoo " " ? Catherine Boyd : " Well I 'm sure I do n't know " . This is a refreshing movie , I recommend it . I have the tape and every once and awhile I will watch it again .
1 Fairly good romantic comedy in which I do n't think I 've ever seen Meg looking any cuter . All the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp . Of course , in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey , but that is why I love romantic comedies .... one can just totally forget reality and have a good time . Nice film . Damn , Meg is a babe , eh ?
1 Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever . This movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for : the creation of a world and time that we want to re - visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race . When I am blue , this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh ( and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh).<br /><br />All of the actors are in top form . The characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor ( usually difficult to do with Matthau , Robbins and Ryan ) . The supporting cast is consistently brilliant : Fry ( " agae " , " a total pygmy package " ! ) , Jacoby & Saks & Maher ( the three theoretical physicists as " Greek chorus " - " but time does n't exist " ) , Durning ( " something we can launch from NJ " ) , Shalhoub & Whaley ( Robbins ' boss and co - worker at the service station ) , and Curits ( Eisenhower - how many comedies have Eisenhower??).<br /><br />Don't miss this overlooked treasure .
1 This is a really fun , breezy , light hearted romantic comedy . You can not go wrong with Meg Ryan 's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein 's genius . Normally , I 'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people , now deceased and not able to defend themselves , but I think the late Einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one.<br /><br />It 's the 1950's ... Princeton , New Jersey in the spring . The story revolves around a pretty , young , scatter brained mathematician , Catherine ( Meg Ryan ) , who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk , a behavioral researcher named James , merely because he has the brains she 's looking for in the father of her future children . However , it 's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named Ed ( Tim Robbins ) . As she does n't think Ed is intelligent enough , her uncle , none other than Albert Einstein , plays match maker , assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies , all theoretical physicists . Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart , so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist ... naturally with amusing results.<br /><br />Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self , and pulls off the character of Einstein quite effectively . With his three professorial buddies , Kurt , Nathan , and Boris , a lot of laughs ensue . The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one ( outrageous ) step further . If you suspend all logic , you can almost imagine this silly story happening!<br /><br />It might not be rocket science ( despite its main character ) but it is a wonderful sweet , refreshing movie . One of the best of the comedy romance genre .
1 I.Q. , in my opinion , is a sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you . If you ask me , James ( Stephen Fry ) really was a dull guy . To me , Ed ( Tim Robbins ) was more suited for Catherine ( Meg Ryan ) than James was . Anyway , everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job . Now , in conclusion , I highly recommend this sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who has n't seen it . You 're in for lots of laughter , so go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .
1 This movie is so great . Its set back in probably the 40 's and Meg Ryan 's character struggles to be known as ' smart . ' Plus Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie . And everything about it has a magical feeling towards it . Everytime I watch it I feel happy . It 's definitely a girl movie , and I 'm a girl , so I like it . I also love the music . The violin is awesome . but besides that I think it 's a cute story and everyone should watch it .
1 Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , and therefore having seen a large number of these films , it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique . For that matter , it is equally rare that I am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes . The love story is a little thin on the ground , but I 'd say that 's probably for the best , as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on " comedy " , and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com 's to do . The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film , but in any film I 've seen in a long while . I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a " 10 " over a " 9 " as a rating , as I believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately , and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact . I 'm also a big Meg Ryan fan , which helps , but this is one of the few films I 've seen in which I 'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed . She and Tim Robbins are cast as the leads , but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals . A genuine laugh - out - loud type film .
1 This film tells the story of a romance between Albert Einstien niece and a gas station attendant . In order to get the two together , Einstien agrees to help Ed(Hudsucker Proxy 's Tim Robbins ) learn to act more intelligent . This impresses Catherine ( Meg Ryan ) . Unfortunately Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered to be a genius . Hilarity ensues . Not to be missed . Filmed in Mercer county New Jersey at Princeton University , Lawrenceville Prep School ( doubling for Princeton University ) as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in Hopewell .
1 While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie , the supporting cast ( including Matthau , Fry , Shalub , Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi , Saks and Maher ) is an additional plus . Matthau shines as Einstein , Fry is perfect as Ryan 's clinical fiancé , and Shalub 's line about Einstein 's gonads is , as has been noted , one of the highlights of the film . The speech that Robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry . Kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity . I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower . This might be considered something of a chick movie , but I think everyone will get a kick out of it . Eight very solid points .
1 It was a doubly interesting experience . For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th Century had never been the central figure in a movie*. The closest I can think of as films with Einstein in them are CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR , where ( like a " deus ex ma - china " ) the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show , so that Ronald Colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all , and in BULLSHOT where the great Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain , intent on stealing some machines of theirs . It is notable that in those two cases , and in IQ , we are dealing with comedies . So far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of Einstein , like John Huston 's attempt to do one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff . I guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro - magnetic field theory into exciting dialog . But then , only three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did A BEAUTIFUL MIND . Maybe nobody really has tried.<br /><br />(*Subsequently , after writing this , I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about ten years ago . But that is an exception and it was a spoof.)<br /><br />The other surprise was the actor playing the great Albert . It was Walter Matthau , here taking time away from the series of films he did with Jack Lemmon in that last decade of their careers . Matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor , in both comedy and drama , but normally his comic personas were variants of his " Whiplash Willie " Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE . They were connivers and gonifs . Later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them , but they remained grumpy types . But his Albert Einstein happens to be genuinely sweet . More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke.<br /><br />He plays Albert as good old uncle Albert . It seems that Matthau 's Einstein is living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd ( Meg Ryan ) , and she is seeing a stuffy professor named James Morland ( Stephen Fry ) . But Fry 's car needs repairs , and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters ( Tim Robbins ) works . Robbins falls for Ryan , who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires . Good old uncle Albert , aided by his three friends ( Lou Jacobi , Joseph Maher , and Gene Saks ) decide to give their assistance to Robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius . This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan , provided Ryan is impressed and Fry does not spoil things ( as he hopes to do).<br /><br />The atmosphere is sweet , as when Matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help Robbins cheat on ( by switching the positions of their bodies ) . The plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant Robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of President Eisenhower ( Keene Curtis).<br /><br />It was a charming comedy , and an interesting stretch for Matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal , but far more subdued .
1 IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest - thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid 's helpers . The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light - hearted yet thoughtful movie . You do n't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love , but at other times , you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space / time of our age . The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout . Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein , Meg Ryan creates a quirky , scatter - brained mathematician , and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science . All together , they create a farcical trip through love and science , mind and heart .
1 The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - " Is the piston firing short ? " ( implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée ) was hilarious . I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie . Very lovable and very intelligent too . Her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours . The hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well . Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche ? The puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well . It 's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival . It loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the US Govt . I do n't see why it does n't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century . Great Movie , it has the presidential seal of approval on it !
1 this movie is a very relaxed , romantic - comedy , which is thoroughly enjoyable . Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein , though she does believe in her own skills . Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up . I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein . This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it , while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it ( if that is actually possible , it happens here).<br /><br />I personally found this movie extremely entertaining , especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious ! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension . If you have a cheeky sense of humour , this is the movie for you !
1 What a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack . Einstein is brilliantly acted by Walter Matthau , while Meg Ryan 's Catherine is unforgettable  better than I have seen her in those films opposite Tom Hanks  as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized.<br /><br />You do n't need to be a young woman to understand Catherine 's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately , and as a young man it 's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed 's ( Tim Robbins ) mind in pursuing his true love . There 's universal appeal in these emotions , even if I.Q. keeps it all light , fun and tied up nicely.<br /><br />Sure it 's not heavy , but if you look there are some subtexts . People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist ; his sayings such as something along the lines of , ' If it is not impossible , then why do it ? ' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one 's immediate grasp . In this film , there are questions of what an accident really is  such as whether Albert and his whacky sidekicks ' intervention in prying Catherine away from stiff - upper - lip , loveless James ( Stephen Fry  who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you can not help but feel for his lack of feeling ) counts . How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see , and comes across as serendipitous?<br /><br />And of course , we 'd like to think in real life , despite what we often observe of the people we know , that we Edwards get the Catherines and Jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins . How nice to know that it might work out in I.Q. 's innocent ( and disturbingly , exclusively Caucasian ) Eisenhower - era land of make - believe .
1 A solid , if unremarkable film . Matthau , as Einstein , was wonderful . My favorite part , and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again , was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton , I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie .
1 This movie had me smiling from beginning to end , partly at the humor , partly at Meg Ryan ( this is the perfect character for her ) , and always because it 's just one of the best feel - good movies I 've seen . Hopefully the DVD will be out soon .
1 This was a great romantic comedy ! Historically inaccurate ( Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb ) but he made a great matchmaker . He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working . The supporting cast ( Lou Jacobi , Joseph Maher , Gene Saks , Stephen Fry , etc . ) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience . The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around . And did he wear socks in one scene ... reportedly , the professor never wore socks ! ( Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section . ) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside , this was a great movie to watch with a great cast . I give it an 8 !
1 While Fred Schepisi 's " I.Q. " does n't really have any important qualities , it 's still worth seeing . Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein , trying to help mechanic Ed Walters ( Tim Robbins ) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd ( Meg Ryan ) . Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends ( Lou Jacobi , Gene Saks and Joseph Maher ) try to make Ed look like a scientist : he ends up looking like a French impressionist.<br /><br />Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate , but that 's not the point . It 's not intended as anything except a light comedy , quite the opposite of Robbins 's most famous movie from 1994 ( The Shawshank Redemption ) . A movie about Einstein 's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements , but also his political activism , namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons ( it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him).<br /><br />So anyway , this one is acceptable . Also starring Stephen Fry , Tony Shalhoub , Frank Whaley , Charles Durning and Keene Curtis .
1 I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it . Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly , playful , slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film . The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better.<br /><br />The story is pure fantasy , but a delightful one . An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman , who happens to be Einstein 's niece . With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics , Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine 's heart . Throw a jealous fiancé ( who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology ) and Eisenhower into the mix , and you have pure fun.<br /><br />The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances . Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp ; cupid with a slide rule . Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom - com level . Stephen fry is a joy as the " RRRatman " and Ryan 's fiancé ; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body.<br /><br />The film fell below most radars , but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings . It features first - rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world .
1 This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein , played wonderfully by Walter Matthau , and his cronies play match maker to his niece ( Meg Ryan ) and a talented auto mechanic ( Tim Robbins ) . The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors . This movie is cute and fun ... a " feel - gooder " ! Hearty recommendations .
1 " A little nonsense now and then , is cherished by the wisest men." < br /><br />If you are too smart to watch this movie , then you are too smart to be alive . < br /><br />Wonderful romp , wonderful premise , period piece done with acute eye for detail.<br /><br />Walter Matthau , Meg Ryan , Tim Robbins - et al - just wonderful!<br /><br />Rent it , sit down , relax , take it in , smile a little . Enjoy yourself . < br /><br />Then , thank me .
1 IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen . Plot is a typical guy wrong for girl , guy gets girl format , but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind . Addition of Albert Einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief . Overall , a good movie . Not great , but good
1 This is a pleasant film , even if the premise is silly . It was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch . Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film ( another example is Joe vs. the Volcano ) . That 's what makes her a star , in part . Walter Matthau , of course , had that ability , too , and he really puts himself into the role , making an amusing , good - hearted Einstein . I suppose you could say they 're both good at portraying loveable characters , though loveable in different ways ( loveable young women vs. loveable curmudgeon ) .
1 Farrah Fawcett has spent the better part of her post - Angel 's career confounding us , with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her Playboy frolics and Letterman escapades . But when it comes down to it , there 's no denying that this girl can act . Far from a story of epic proportions , this well - done TV - movie is gentle , quiet and occasionally moving . Fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom 's life as well as the funeral , much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister . Brad Johnson plays the love interest , and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama- but then there 's always that confounding Farrah to watch , and she does , indeed , remain eminently watchable . ( And , yes , I admit it , I did have that Farrah poster on my wall way back when ) . Silk Hope gets three and a half stars ( out of five ) on the Corkymeter . Bosley would be proud .
1 This is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it , it has lot 's of laughs , guns , action , crime , , good one liners , and a decent plot , with an over the top , Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role as an Assasain . Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too , Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the lead character " Max " a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent , played by Carerra , and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV , plays the bad guy , , " Livingston " . The plot centers around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies , throw into the mix the Assassain Sutherland , who pretty much has all the good one liners , this is the perfect crime caper , there is the usual love story , , but played very differently than you would think by Carerra and Griffith . You also have the Russian mafia , Italian Mafia , and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix , , the film is shot in Boston , , where you have some great shots , and locals , , great photography and music in this film , this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy , , it has everything that one could ever want . Check out Sutherland 's toilet in a particular scene , , very unusual . this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me .
1 Enormous fun for both adults and children , this film works on numerous levels : there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good ( yet subtle ) jokes for adults.<br /><br />Glenn Close is at her sublimely evil best as Cruella ( ` call me Ella ' ) De Ville.<br /><br />After three years in Dr. Pavlov 's Behaviour Modification Clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy - skin fur she had so intensely desired . She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits.<br /><br />But it would n't be a Dalmatian ' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification . And now she needs one extra puppy ( hence 102 Dalmatians ) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the ` Second Chance ' dog shelter . Though he was in ` Titanic ' and in last year 's television version ( as Pip ) of ` Great Expectations ' I did n't recognize him ; well , he was Fifth Officer Lowe ' in ` Titanic ' and I did n't see ` Great Expectations ' so I am not terribly surprised.<br /><br />Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier - pawn of Cruella . He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well . His ' Wicked Witch of the West ' homage is hilarious.<br /><br />Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella 's not - so - evil henchman  he was also Alonzo , ' Cruella 's butler , in ` 101 Dalmatians ' and you may also recognize him from all of the ` Black Adder ' Brit - Coms . He plays his usual bumbling , good - hearted , somewhat dim - witted character to great effect.<br /><br />Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film . This is unfortunate as the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed ( note her handcuffs when she is being released from the Behaviour Modification Clinic ) and worthy of such an over - the - top character . Her clothing alone deserves at least an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans : it ca n't be done . Suffice it to say that ` 102 Dalmatians ' is even better than the film version of ` 101 Dalmatians ' that came out in 1996 . There is a lot to like here : from the sight gags , the dialogue , and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family .
1 In 1996 's " 101 Dalmatians , " Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitain Police ( God bless them ) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians . All covered in mud and hay , she spent the next 4 years in the " tin can . " Now , 4 years later , she , unfortunately , was released from the jail . I say , that 's about 28 years - in dog years!!!!!<br /><br />So , in 2000 , Disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live - action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed " 102 Dalmatians . " In it , there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family ( Oddball is the name , I think ; I should know this since this was just shown on TV recently ) , and the puppy had no spots ! ! ! ! ! Also , while Cruella ( again played by Glenn Close ) has escaped again , she wanted a bigger , better coat - made once again out of the puppies!!!!!<br /><br />I especially liked the theme song - I 'm sure everybody loves the " Atomic Dog " song from the 70s or so . And now , we hear a bit of it in this movie!!!!!<br /><br />"102 Dalmatians " is such a great film that I keep on wondering - WHEN WILL THERE BE A " 103 DALMATIANS ? ? ? ? ? " LOL < br /><br />10 stars
1 The first film was a nice one , but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing . This sequel is inferior , but not bad at all . Sure the slapstick is too much , the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired . But the dogs are very cute here , and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw . The film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella 's ) , and the music is pleasant . The acting is mostly very good , Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella 's accomplice . But the best asset , as it was with the first film , is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over - the - top performance as Cruella , even more evil than she was previously . Overall , nice . 7/10 Bethany Cox
1 Arguably this is a very good " sequel " , better than the first live action film 101 Dalmatians . It has good dogs , good actors , good jokes and all right slapstick ! < br /><br />Cruella DeVil , who has had some rather major therapy , is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them . Many , including Chloe Simon , owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill , do not believe this . Others , like Kevin Shepherd ( owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter ) believe that she has changed . < br /><br />Meanwhile , Dipstick , with his mate , have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies ! Little Dipper , Domino and Oddball ... <br /><br />Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth ( the hilarious macaw ) , Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt ( another baddie , the name should give a clue ) , this is a good family film with excitement and lots more ! ! One downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick , but not quite as excessive as the last film . This is also funnier than the last film.<br /><br />Enjoy " 102 Dalmatians " ! :-)
1 I noticed at once that this movie really was n't based on Dodie Smith 's novel . In any case , it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita 's son now had his own puppies . The cutest of the Dalmatians was , of course , little Snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film . < br /><br />To be honest , I did n't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely kind . In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly , but now that she so quickly changed into " herself " again and announced that she was Cruella once more , I almost began to be really worried about Chloe 's Dalmatians.<br /><br />Actually , the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner , was much better than I had expected . I also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog , and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie . < br /><br />Of course I was content that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again , but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property . And what on earth could the dogs ' home do with such a huge sum of money?<br /><br />Finally , it was quite touching that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film .
1 This is just as good as the original 101 if not better . Of course , Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits , and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella . We see a lot more of her this time round . I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin , the rather bumbling male lead . To use Paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea . The movie is well worth watching whatever your age , provided you like animals .
1 While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations ( live action , not animated version ) , I think it still fell a little short of what Disney could do . It was well - filmed , the music was more suited to the action , and the effects were better done ( compared to 101 ) . The acting was perhaps better , but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel , and Glenn Close is really not to be missed , as in the first movie . She makes it shine . Her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of , and they add to the spectacle Disney has given us . This is a great family film , with little or no objectionable material , and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike . It 's bound to be a classic , as so many Disney films are . Here 's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one . ;)
1 I enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time . Do n't take the film all too seriously because remember it 's Disney and it 's rated G. It 's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice , particularly the " triangle " between Cruella , Le Pelt , and Cruella 's faithful valet Alonso . Glenn Close is fantastic and really has made Cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is " cured " of her fur loving ways , she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater . ( I even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her ' bipolarity ' as the dog loving Ella . ) All in all I will go see it again in theaters , I found myself enjoying it so much .
1 I really like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996 , now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001 , i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it 's more funnier , more humor , and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version ( one hundred and one dalmations ( 1961 ) i wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations . I hope there is , maybe yes , maybe no , all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future .
1 If you like animal movies , this movie will please . My wife likes animals and animal movies , she especially like the parrot in this film . It is geared towards kids , but I laughed at most of the humor . The French fashion character made me laugh , and adds balance to the script . It is a Disney film , with its sappy , happily , family apeal , but I like leaving the theater with a positive fealing .
1 I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of Romania . This tells something certainly about the value , or maybe about the lack of universality of the film , but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries , even in Eastern Europe.<br /><br />The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda , a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule soon after the book was published . It tells the story of an intellectual , professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era . Basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison , the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released . His release is actually only apparent , Romania of the 60s asks from him different types of compromises and crimes , but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prison.<br /><br />The film is splendidly acted by some of the best Romanian actors . Stefan Iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega - star , we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art . Although suffering from a hesitant story - telling and falling sometimes in non - essential details or character comics , the film is still an important landmark for the Romanian cinema , as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the Romanian society .
1 The movie follows the events of the novel " Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni " ( could be translated as " The most beloved among humans " ) , written by Marin Preda ( a very controversial book and movie ) , a novel which became something like The Bible or the story of Hamlet , very popular and hard to get , due to its satiric contents over the Communist regime . It represents the drama of the intellectual man , the humanist , in a " red " world . A movie filled with passion , fear , sexuality , all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe . One of the greatest Romanian movies , despite its psychological charge(after all , it is an European movie ) .
1 I liked it ! The plot was weird , Drew Barrymore and DC making out was awkward for both of them . Drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time . Dennis Christopher as the shrink was pretty cool , and as always he does his best - i 'm a major Dennis fan anyway , that 's why i bought the DVD.<br /><br />I did n't get the ending ! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool , which is OK i guess but it could have been more . < br /><br /> .... and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why did n't they just get rid of it ? < br /><br />It was very confusing as to when it was the Doppelganger weird thing or when it was DC - or was it Dennis all the time ? Because the Doppelganger made out with Dennis and Patrick . In the scenes with Patrick if it was Dennis as the Doppelganger then I think Patrick would notice.<br /><br />The music was OK but obtrusive in places , the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.<br /><br />A big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of Drew nude . < br /><br />All in all a bit of a GPM - Guilty Pleasure Movie . Do n't read too much into it , do n't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wo nt find it . There are some diamond moments and goofs galore- WATCH IT AND JUST HAVE A BIT OF FUN WITH IT !
1 When two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany 's , you know something is going to go right . Drew Barrymore , Patrick Highsmith , Leslie Hope , and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors . The FBI agent was a terrible actor . The scenes where Patrick looked Holly up and down like some sort of objectifier , those was just weird . Drew Barrymore is very hot . Intimate Strangers , where Sally Kellerman worked , was a great part . The weird gummy worm was just weird . Nathan was a very handsome cat . But what was that scene where Patrick followed Holly into a cesspool and Mr. Gooding attacked him ? And the scene with Dr. Wallace ? What was he doing fumbling around in there ? And not every male has a female , as Sally Kellerman stated . And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside of Victor 's , that was weird .
1 Drew Barrymore was excellent in this film . This role is the type of role you do n't normally see Drew play . Her typical role is as a woman looking for love . The storyline is also great.<br /><br />When Holly is implicated in her mother 's murder she moves to L.A. She moves in with a guy who becomes her lover . But her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused . It is then revealed to her lover that she has Multiple Personality Disorder . After that another woman becomes paranoid when she 's around her . In the end though , they find out the truth .
1 There is a certain genius behind this movie . I was laughing throughout . The scene in the phone sex office , discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius / humor . Execution is poor , but you can see the writer 's message and they do have some talent . The doppelganger split at the end was like ... " ok , was n't quite expecting that but let 's see what the movie has to say " . Certainly ridiculous , but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.<br /><br />Is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level ? i 'm easily bored by many movies , but this one kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />I think the story may have some auto - biographical roots , but that 's just a guess . Horribly bad , but good . I 'm looking for other movies this person may have done ( with more experience ) .
1 Always enjoy the great acting of Drew Barrymore and her great performance in this film , where she plays a very very complicated young gal,(Holly Gooding),"Skipped Parts",2000 , who leaves New York and travels to California and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer , George Newbern,(Patrick Highsmith),"Far Harbor",'96 . Many strange things start to happen to Holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father . If you look close enough you will actually see the mother of Drew Barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture . If it was not for the good acting of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern , this film should be seen only on Halloween Night ! However , it sure has it 's surprises in the END ! ! ! !
1 I have to hand it to the creative team behind these " American Pie " movies . " Direct To DVD " typically is synonymous with cheap , incompetent film - making . Yet last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the DVD sequel " The Naked Mile " . The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy , yet funny little film . This year they offer up the followup , " Beta House " . This is the honest truth , " Beta House " makes the first few " American Pie " movies look like " The Little Mermaid".<br /><br />This is no holds barred , tasteless , laugh - out loud fun . Sure , the story is a bit thin , but that 's the beauty of the whole thing . Within the first 10 minutes we 're introduced to the all the main characters , the new supporting characters , get a handful of raunchy gags , meet the villains , and establish the general plot - line . With all that out of the way , the movie becomes a no - limits ride . The gags are a plenty , and they DID NOT hold back in this one . I 'm talking male semen , urine , dildos , chicks - with - dicks , sex with sheep , female orgazim sprays , and plenty more . Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene.<br /><br />Returning from " The Naked Mile " are John White , Jake Siegel , Steve Talley , and Eugene Levy ( in a similar supporting role as the last few films ) . The entire cast does fine work . Steve Talley ( Dwight Stifler ) , in particular , has a great energy and screen presence . I predict good things for him . The film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open . By far the biggest laugh of the film for me was " The Deerhunter " parody . Classic.<br /><br />The bottom line is , if you 're a fan of the series , you 'll feel right at home with " Beta House " . It really pushes the limits of good taste , but in the end is pretty damn funny .
1 This movie is plain fun . I has nothing to do with the original America Pie , but it is fun to watch.<br /><br />Another try , but better than Band camp and The naked mile , at least funnier.<br /><br />Just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out , so I decided to call my friend and we would watch it together . We had a few beers and we had fun.<br /><br />You will not find any deep message in this movie , but it 's worth watching.<br /><br />So , lay back and just enjoy .
1 * Firstly , although many say it is the worst of the series , i do n't think that it is true , considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality .it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do.<br /><br / > * I Agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays are n't supposed to be for teenagers?i mean ... cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out ; plus , seeing such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for having a very good time.<br /><br / > * Many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie . Well ... let 's get real ... doesn't that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie ? what would you like to see ... smart books , romantic stuff ? that is not at all what would be in those teenagers ' minds ... < br /><br / > * To conclude , i think that if you are a teenager , you must absolutely see the movie , and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman , you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenager , or things like that . Thanks for reading !
1 Wow , this was another good spin off of the original American pie , not as good as band camp , but definitely a lot better the naked mile . Dwight and Erik stifler lead the comedy in this one , but I actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile . The script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly , however most of the comedy came from sex , but that 's okay because that 's why we watch these movies anyway right ? < br /><br />The midget Rock also had a really good cameo , considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile , his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it.<br /><br />The movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile , if you liked any previous American Pie films , you should like beta house , unless you view all of the American pie spin - offs a waste of money .
1 i just watched the movie i was afraid it 's gon na disappoint me . i was rather surprised at the end though . The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times . yes , it wo n't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones . beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had.it is not gon na become a classic as the first two already did . but what the hell - it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school . beta house deserves 6/10 but i gave it 7/10 just for being another slice of PIE .
1 This is by far one of my favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character ( one of the young Stiflers ) always seems unrealistic in nature . < br /><br />For example AP : The Naked Mile . You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks , and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity " problem " and he ends up stopping mid - deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend , who keep in mind gave him a " guilt free pass " for the weekend . I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let 's be realistic ; most people who are watching these movies are n't particularly searching for a romantic story.<br /><br />Whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always Mr. Levenstein lends his " perfectly natural " eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie .
1 Ti%s and As * , lots of boobies . Some great characters , fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise . This feels like really OLD SCHOOL . It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000 's . Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me.<br /><br />Whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one , this movie I found really entertaining . Lets not get too excited , you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is , but for what it is , it excels . The characters are likable and funny , the girls are hotter than hell . The fun and games are hilarious , with some stuff I 've never seen before in comedies , they make me cringe but laugh at the same time.<br /><br />So ignore the haters and give this a run and see what you think . Do n't expect the classic American Pie , but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so .
1 Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott 's performance as Stifler but after that the quality has dropped . Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled ( Erik Stifler 's sex problem is like Jim 's ) . It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the ' punishment ' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the ' Mile ' was just stupid and moronic . Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does n't want to have sex . < br /><br />Anyway enough about the Naked Mile . I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought it could take the series to a new low but I was pleasantly surprised . To be honest there is no real plot but it 's filled with hot girls ( Ashley is incredible ) and sex jokes aplenty . Yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but Dwight Stifler ( Steve Talley ) raises the bar with an exuberant performance . The Greek Olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald 's cameo is hilarious . There are weak points though . Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first , I 'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part . < br /><br />While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse . John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new low . First and foremost he lacks charisma , a Stifler prerequisite . You really ca n't care less about him . The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on screen ! She shines above him as does the rest of the cast . Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish . < br /><br />Saying that the film does entertain and Coozeman 's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny . < br /><br />Overall this film is worth renting , get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit - fest event and vent your anger at Erik ' loser ' Stifler .
1 OK , it was a good American Pie . Erick Stifler goes off to college with his buddy Cooze . During their arrival they meet up with Eric 's cousin Dwight . The two pledge to become Betas and along the way they get involved with a whole lot of sex , tits , and some hot girls along the way . In a few words there is a lot more sex , nudity and alcohol . It is a good movie for those who want to enjoy an American Pie movie , granted it is n't as great as the first three is is a good movie . If you enjoy hot girls with really nice tits , get this movie . If you enjoy seeing a bunch of dudes making assholes of themselves , go to this movie . If you want to see the full thing , get the unrated addition . One last thing this is a better attempt than the last two American Pies .
1 Funny , sexy , hot ! ! ! There is no real plot but you need n't anyone ... <br /><br />so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college - cliques need no development!<br /><br />All in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others.<br /><br />Last thing I 've got to say . Unbelievable funny!<br /><br />You've got to see it ! ! ! < br /><br />And if you are young and you want know more about the female body you 've got to see it twice
1 A lot of people hated this movie , but that I blame on two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first couple of American Pie movies . and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously.<br /><br />This one I found was the best one out of all six , and I absolutely love Dwight . The plot is predictable , I 'll say that , but then what teen comedy ISN'T ? Road Trip , Dirty Deeds etc etc , they are all incredibly predictable , but still goddamn funny ! I say this is worth watching , I love it , I find it hilarious . Just do n't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it 's nothing alike.<br /><br />After watching Naked Mile and this one , it became obvious that all the American Pie movies were about , and only about , the Stiflers . Which is FINE by me.<br /><br />Watch . Enjoy . Love . xD
1 This is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made ! Although I 've only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a good movie . The plot if funny and because there 's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie . It 's really funny and I do n't see how anyone could NOT like this film . I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie . It has one slightly sick scene in it ( trust me , it 's not very pleasant ) but apart from that this is a great movie . I rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy , 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot . PLease if your a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there 's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie . It WILL please you.<br /><br />10/10
1 Overall I found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch , with plenty of laugh out loud moments . < br /><br />But , this movie is not for everyone . That is why I created this quick question - ere , if you answer yes to any of the following questions than I recommend watching this flick < br /><br />(1)Do you enjoy crude sexual humor ? ( 2)Do you enjoy alcohol related humor ? ( 2)Do you enjoy amazingly hot girls ? ( 3)Do you enjoy viewing boobs ? ( 4)Do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs ? ( 5)Did I mention all the nice boobies in this film?<br /><br />If you noticed the spoiler alert , that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie , I myself have no idea what the plot was about . Not that it matters .
1 This film never received the attention it deserved , although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting , and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on screen . Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital , the center of the story is Joel , very well - played by Eric Stoltz . Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident , and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries . Joel is in love with Anna , his married lover , played by Helen Hunt , who shows early signs of her later Academy - Award winning work.<br /><br />Although the Joel - Anna relationship is the basic focus , there are many other well - developed characters in the ward . Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond . Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss . I think Forsythe 's two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers , and , later , when he feels empathy for a young Korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up . My favorite scene with Snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post - injury sexual options.<br /><br />The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong , and they have two very intimate , but not gratuitous , sex scenes . The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing . There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially - equipped van to the strip bar . It 's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the " naked ladies." < br /><br />The story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director , Neal Jimenez , is paralyzed in real life . This is basically his story . This film is real , not glossy or flashy . To have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing . I recommend this film to everyone I see , because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look . It 's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked , but through video , perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves .
1 This was one of those films I probably never would have picked off the shelf , but it came on IFC one day and I said - Eric Stolz , William Forsythe ... why not ? If I 'd changed the channel , I would have really missed a treasure . < br /><br />The subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower - class rehabilitation center . It would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear - jerker . But , that does n't happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez , after he himself was accidently paralyzed . No Hollywood happiness here . All of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds , but they share a feeling of helplessness , of being at the mercy of others . Stolz is very good as a " lone wolf " type , forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend ( Helen Hunt ) ; Wesley Snipes is fine as a former ladies ' man whose family is falling apart ; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence.<br /><br />See this film .
1 _ Waterdance _ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully . From the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality , masculinity and depression , the experience of disability is laid open.<br /><br />The diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined - Joel , the writer , Raymond , the black man with a murky past , and Bloss , the racist biker . At first , these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries , but retain their competitive spirit . Over time , shared experience , both good and bad , brings them together as friends to support one another.<br /><br />Most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by Joel , who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses , headphones and curtains . As he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life , Joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward.<br /><br />The dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one 's head above water ; to give up the dance is to reject life . _ Waterdance _ is a moving and powerful film on many levels , and I do not hesitate to recommend it .
1 I know , that 's not what you expect from a film with this sort of < br /><br />lineage- it 's a direct descendant of The Best Years of Our Lives < br /><br />and The Men ... films dealing with men who are in the hospital < br /><br />dealing with tragic circumstances . But this film is full of wonderful < br /><br />surprises and performances . It features stellar performances from < br /><br />Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt ( including a rather risque nude scene)<br /><br />and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe . As Emanuel Levy wrote < br /><br />in his book Cinema of Outsiders ( about the Independent film < br /><br />movement ) " The Waterdance is coherant , attentive to detail , and < br /><br />unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it ' s at once < br /><br />funny and sad , and the entire cast is impressive . " I was < br /><br />extraordinarily moved by this film , it 's hard hitting yes , but also has < br /><br />very tender moments and laugh out loud moments . A rare gem .
1 It 's funny how your life can change in a second ... To attend ' ' The Waterdance '' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience , the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening , and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on . < br /><br />Eric Stoltz 's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt ( oh man ! , Helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth ... ) are wonderful , Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles . A film simple and at the same time deep that does n't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted : enjoy each moment of your life ... <br /><br />Really to a film as that the any hour is not attended ! ! ! ( sorry , it 's a Brazilian expression ... ) .
1 Touching and sad movie . Portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident . The film centers on his relationship with his married lover , whom he is often very hostile towards , and his interactions with other accident victims , particularly a black down - and - out and a white - supremacist biker . The film is often humorous , often sad , and always believable . Get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy Sunday afternoon with your partner .
1 This film lingered and lingered at a small movie theater in town , and the word - of - mouth buzz got me to see it . A comedy about disabled people - the subject matter keeps lots of people away from a funny and heart - warming film .
1 I thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism . This movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable . The acting was top - notch and the movie reminded me of " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest " .
1 I recently got the chance to view " The Waterdance " , and quite liked it . I do n't really understand why its called that as there is n't really any dancing going on there , except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end . We are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie , invalids in a hospital . The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman , which is a very sweet story . Unfortunately , you do n't get to see movies like that today . I m not " stuck in a time warp " , i m not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today , but I really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there 's much we can learn from old movies - by old movies i mean anything from 1920 - 1998 .
1 This work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs . This film never tries to tone it down , cotton candy - ize , or soft soap the angst , confusion , and pain of what these guys live with . That is its strength , I think.<br /><br />But more so , the performances are fantastic , with well conceived and delivered dialog , which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience . The characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what 's on their mind - what 's in their hearts.<br /><br />I found it plodding , but enjoyable.<br /><br />It rates a 6.6/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
1 Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia , a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident . While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick , fast - talking , charming womanizer Raymond ( an amazing Wesley Snipes ) and boorish , surly , racist biker Bloss ( a terrific William Forsythe ) , who feels threatened by the diverse multi - ethnic array of fellow patients he 's forced to share a room with . Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving , but married girlfriend Anna ( radiantly played by Helen Hunt ) . But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own.<br /><br />This remarkable movie 's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through . Directors Neil Jimenez ( who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script ) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste , wit and warmth , specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter - of - factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one 's lifestyle , including and especially your sex life ( this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room ) . Besides the expected poignancy , the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw , earthy humor that 's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club . The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus : Stoltz , Snipes , Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding , with stand - out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss ' doting , amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses . Despite the grim subject matter , the film ultimately proves to be a very moving , positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit . A simply wonderful little gem of a drama .
1 This movie is more Lupin then most , especially coming from Funimation . Other then the bad dub , it is n't bad.<br /><br />The first hour is a lot like the Comic ( which is what all Lupin the 3rd stuff is based on ) . Lupin 's trying to get a huge treasure . Fujiko 's using Lupin 's weakness to women to try to get something out of it . The last bit is n't that bad , he 's with another women , but of course Fujiko 's still him number one.<br /><br />A lot of the other Lupin movies are more Family with cuss words then Lupin . Any good Lupin fan I think will be pleasantly surprised ( I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie ) . It might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits ( they make it a little mushy ) but overall , it is n't a bad film . Good enough to be one of the few I 'd watch again of the Lupin III movies .
1 Lupin sets off for Morocco , looking for a legendary treasure . His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him . It 's a nice different location for Lupin , with the desert and that hot exotic feel.<br /><br />One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual , generally being in a different place than Lupin . On one hand their classic dynamic together is missed , but it is a change of pace . Plus , this way , Lupin can focus on the ladies ... <br /><br />Fujiko rules in this . Throughout the entire feature she is seducing Lupin , and us viewers . Then there 's Lara , the damsel of this particular tale , and she 's quite likable . This one has more nudity than any other Lupin anime , which is a fun distinction to have.<br /><br />There 's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who 's the best villain in this , and naturally he has some great fighting with Goemon , as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko . Inspector Zenigata of course is also on a warpath here , in fine form.<br /><br />Pretty much , this is a smooth ride with Lupin . The plot is average and there are some slow spots , but all in all this movie is a real pleasure . Enjoy .
1 Although the plot was a bit sappy at times , and VERY rushed at the end , as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story , overall it was pretty good for the Made - For - Backwoods - Cable - TV genre . < br /><br />However , the actress who played the babysitter , Mariana Klaveno , was very good ! I hope to see more of her around in movie - land . The music was also well done , getting every possible chill out of the dah - DUH - dah - DUH ( think " JAWS " ) type music - based tension build - ups.<br /><br />I do n't think I 'd want to watch " While the Children Sleep " again , but if I did , it would be to focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno .
1 Not sure why it does n't play in Peoria , apparently , but this is a very funny , clever British comedy . It 's set at the end of the " swinging sixties " . Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich , forty - something serial womaniser . The perfectly delectable Goldie Hawn , playing a 19 year American girl in London , is , initially , Sellars ' " catch of the day " . But the urbane TV food critic ca n't stop himself from falling for the dizzy American blond.<br /><br />Humour , pathos , great script , strong performances from the leads and supporting caste.<br /><br />It 's a great film , and the best gag is the very last line.<br /><br />Try it , you 'll like it .
1 I ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off . Peter Sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawn ( who would n't ? ) . The way that Goldie 's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today . This movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also I found it very funny . Peter Sellers role was a difficult sell , but I think he pulls it off well .
1 I like Peter Sellers , most of the time . I had never seen him portray an upper - class Brit until this movie . He pulls it off pretty well , although you see bits of Inspector Clouseau in the mix . It does n't get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives.<br /><br />I never expected the youthful Hawn to deliver such a solid performance . Her timing was great and her expressions were priceless . The way she alternately shoots Sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch . Verbal sparring like I 've seldom seen from a movie of that era.<br /><br />The last thirty minutes of the movie DOES fall flat . It is worth the let down just to see the first sixty . Hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on . Enjoy it ...
1 Allow me to just get to the bottom line here : I 've got 3 kids , ages 5 to 10 . I consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals . I 've seen most of the children 's videos in our collection at least 72 times . I can tell you when the film gets reversed in The Wizard of Oz , the over-18 sexual joke in El Dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer . I could probably storyboard Nemo from memory alone.<br /><br />What makes me support the one child of mine ( it varies ) who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening ? In a word : Showerman.<br /><br />Moment of silence ... <br /><br />*sigh *
1 I loved this movie ! Chris Showerman did an amazing job ! Not only is he an incredible actor , but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique ! He did a great job on the delivery of his lines , plus transformed into George better than Fraser did . A great performance for his first major roll ! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love . My kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the DVD the day it came out . In addition to the movie , the extras on the DVD are just as hilarious . Two thumbs up on this one ! I highly recommend it to everyone !
1 In order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it 's supposed to be : children 's . They had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie ( meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st ) taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch . Sequels usually make me nervous , however this one did pretty well for itself . Knowing that it did n't have the star power of Fraiser as George they capitalized on the humor and i believe Showeman did pretty well as the lead . The plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience , if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it , but if you want to watch a simple , fun , energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one .
1 The kids , aged 7 to 14 , got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year . They all loved it ! Kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently , and we get a kick out of watching it with them.<br /><br />It 's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long , and offers laughs for the adults , too . Most enjoy it more than the first.<br /><br />Top - quality production and an excellent cast , led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George -- athletic , energetic , and wholly credible , with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face -- well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother - in - law , Thomas Haden Church as the evil jerk rival , and everybody else . This is fun .
1 I was a fan of the book ever since third grade , so of course I had watched the movie , read the sequel , and then watched the television show . It was a good show in itself , and now as an adult I still enjoy the show . My only real problem with it was that it did n't follow the book . The first time I saw it , I was so disappointed that I turned it off . But that 's coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book . But after time I decided to give it a try again and ignored the book ( kind of like what you have to do with the Harry Potter movies ) . I found the series wonderful ! It was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy , just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going . It is truly enjoyable ! Clean and wonderful !
1 I found this show really late at night , and gave it a try . It 's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night , if you catch my drift . Its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children . It 's something I indulge in whenever I find it on ( which is rare , maybe I should actually check the listings ! haha ) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute . Like any good chick flick , you really get emotionally involved in the characters . Good ol' Louisa May Alcott still inspiring good stories :) So apparently I must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid , so I guess I 'll tell you a bit more . The kids are played by talented actors and actresses , and the settings are lovely and nature - filled -- another thing you do n't see much on television . I hope everyone gives it a shot . I recognize and am fully aware that it 's sappy , but it 's good heart . Like I said before , it 's refreshing .
1 I absolutely loved this show . I watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90 's to the very last episode . In my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days . Definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children . Yes things have changed a bit with Jo since we last saw her in the books , but it 's still compelling with great stories and good lessons . The actress that portrays Jo Bhaer ( Michelle Burke ) does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays Nick Riley ( Spencer Rochfort ) Throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between Jo and Nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn . I recommend this show to anyone .
1 I thought the movie was actually pretty good . I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well . The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell . I have to see the big budget one coming out today , obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable . When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it . There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related . The acting was pretty good the F / X and stunts were well done . A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst . and the boy who played the child . These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK .
1 Astounding ..... This may have been A poor attempt at remaking the already recreated Omen Movie , but I sure enjoyed it.<br /><br />That last Man who commented is a fool , This Movie was one of a kind , And the Music Dark , Jerry Goldsmith Himself , would had applaud this Movie.<br /><br />Great recommendations from Myself to Watch or Buy this Film.<br /><br />I collect horror Movies and Soundtracks , So listen to what I have to say , not that other idiot.<br /><br />There is only one thing that do not fascinate Me , the endings.<br /><br />According to Prophecy it is all inaccurate , Including Final conflict , and Left behind.<br /><br />But My conclusion being .... There great Movies ... and should be seen , before the Great Depression falls upon Us , and Before the Democrats Take over the Presidency too.<br /><br />So Signed .... Jacob Eder ... A Farmer , with A Mastermind .
1 I ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale . While scanning thousands of videos , hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale , I came across this movie . I read the back of the movie and knew it was God 's hand at work for me to purchase this movie . You see , I have a sibling group of three foster ( and soon to be adopted ) children living with my family . Immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie . The movie helped them better understand their own circumstances . For the first time , also , the oldest of the sibling group ( 7 year old / female ) decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced . She has been fighting the entire trust issue . This is also the first time I had seen her cry . After watching the film , I asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted . She replied , " It means to be happy . " A must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption . It certainly opened the lines of communication with us .
1 Russ and Valerie are having discussions about starting a family . The couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles . At the same time , a dedicated adoption agency owner takes a mini vacation and leaves the orphanage in the charge of his father ( Leslie Nielsen ) . Father Harry is in the rental business and he gets the brilliant idea to " rent " some of the children of the orphanage to couples like Russ and Valerie . Harry , who becomes aware of the couple'e dilemma , offers a family of siblings for a 10 day rental period ! Brandon , Kyle , and Molly move into the apartment with their temporary parents , with amusing consequences , as the new caretakers are inexperienced with kids . But , where is the possibility of a happy ending ? This is a darling family film . The actors , including Nielsen as the wheeler - dealer and Christopher Lloyd as the kind apartment doorman , are all wonderful . The script is snappy and fun and the overall production values quite high . Yes , if only life could be this way ! Orphaned children everywhere deserve a chance to prove that they are lovable and can give so much joy to the parents who are considering adoption . If you want to show a film to your family that is rooted in good values but is also highly entertaining , find this movie . It is guaranteed to have everyone laughing , even as their hearts are melting .
1 This movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble . When the director goes on vacation , his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is positively the best work that Leslie Nielson has ever done . His idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative , and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her . Just make sure that you do n't miss the first five minutes of the movie ! < br /><br />Such great family entertainment is so rare these days . If you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings , go for this one ! I could watch this over and over , and I often do ! My only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy .
1 The cast was good , and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd , whom I like from previous movies . The movie was a great family movie , nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids , a good story line , lots of laughs , lighthearted and enjoyable . If you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill . Kid pleasing , and not difficult for a parent to watch , either .
1 When an orphanage manager goes on vacation , his father takes over the details of the center and winds up renting the kids . When a well off , got it made couple with a nice apartment and great life get the notion to adopt this idea was tailor made for them . Why would they want to spoil their elegant existence with a trio of hairbrained carpet creepers ? No way would people like these two need kids to make life wonderful . This movie makes it look like the real world works this way , but I am the picture of dubiety .
1 I have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes , i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me . Notwithstanding this is not a " movie with a plot " , its about real guys and some of the " problems " that they face . I found the movie hilarious(especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other ) . Simply put , if you are in the same " wave - length " as these people , you will find this movie amazing . I do n't think that this is going win any Golden Globes or Oscars , or that the people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars , but its a kind of " cult - classic " among young people who could relate to their experience . For me the guy that stands out the most is Hans : the Scandinavian guy , who , according to him " is nt a looker " , but gets all(or some ) of the chicks . The " little - people " also play a big part in the movie , especially when they are drunk . If i keep going , i might provide a spoiler and i do n't want to do that , just go and get the movie and you will not regret . I give it a 8/10
1 I can tell you just how bad this movie is . I was in the movie and I have n't seen it yet , but I cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk . Especially considering what we did that year . The thing is that they probably over edited it . Especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a Mexican prostitute ( they probably should have followed him around ) . We made a few come and go appearances but aside from that I ca n't really remember anything . I was the MC in a few scenes ( from what I 'm told . What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world ( or the girl that loser lost his virginity to ) . Overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them .
1 This film reinvents the term " Spring Breakumentary . " Hans , the fat one of the group , displays his talents as this generations Chris Farley . Johnny Kansas , " the King of the $ 1 bet , " shows he 's not in Kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes . Kyle 's laugh is truly infecting , and offers a little eye - candy for the ladies as well ( as does Matt ) . The dwarfs , while having their moments , did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance like it deserves . And last , we have our protagonist , Ed . He gives hope to all of us bumbling , stumbling , gangly , pale folk who are still searching for that special someone . And that hope , is a little place called Cabo San Lucas . While this blockbuster just missed the theaters , this is a must rent , as we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentarions .
1 This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year . It 's still a competent thriller , the machine carried on without him perfectly , but  something was missing : Dix ! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting , sometimes brilliant , the screenplays often noir always atmospheric , but it was n't only the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen , Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad . Is the potential groom put off , even when the private dick he 's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams , or is love blind ? Who 's twisting who is the question . Michael Duane in his penultimate film is OK if a bit of a wimp , lovely Lenore Aubert 's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein , and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie . Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain , unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A lot happened in this last hour , well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me . The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows , nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I 've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well .
1 I hate reading reviews that say something like , ' Do n't waste your time , this film stinks on ice . ' It does to that reviewer yet for me , it may have some sort of naïve charm . If you like the other ' Whistler ' series films , this one will be watchable . If you like 40s noirish films , this one will be watchable.<br /><br />This film is not as good , in my opinion , as any of the earlier series entries which starred Richard Dix as the protagonist . It 's much slower , and the plot is trite . You 've seen this same narrative device used in many other films , and usually better.<br /><br />But the acting is good , and so is the lighting , and the dialog . It 's just lacking in energy and you 'll likely figure out exactly what 's going on and how it 's all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through.<br /><br />The ' Whistler ' series is semi - noir , and there character , mood , lighting , camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself . But this film is not noir . It 's too light weight and Hollywood innocent for that . Neither Richard Dix 's character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end . You just never knew until the end.<br /><br />But still , I 'll recommend this one for at least a single viewing . I 've watched it at least twice myself , and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times .
1 Richard Dix decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place playing the role as Ted Nichols who meets up with a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley , ( Lenore Aubert ) . This couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by a Justice of the Peace ( Judge ) and it is pouring rain when they pull up to the Judge 's home and find out he is not home and will not return until the next day . As the couple are inside the house you see some one lift up the hood of their car and takes an automobile part from the engine . Once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a big surprise and the story beings to reveal a very mysterious event which surrounds Alice Barkley and so poor Ted Nichols starts out with plenty of trouble and no marriage . Good mystery , but I missed Richard Dix . Enjoy .
1 Well you take O.J. Simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just incase no one else is going to and Arte Johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who does n't know what to do but does n't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a busload of people to die on the dessert and you have got to have action , plot twists and a lot of drama . Everyone was good but seeing Lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my mind . He was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him . This was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image . And believe me a 20 year old Lorenzo in tight jeans you really do n't want to miss !
1 . . .but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy . I 'd really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie , I was driving that model bus . It was only ( during his murder trial some 15 years later ) that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it . I only recall that he was the driver and of the bus ' being shot up and driven wildly . I 've been looking all over for this movie to no avail , since viewing it in the mid-80s . I liked the movie , I do n't usually watch thrillers , but after reading the summary in the TV guide , and viewing its beginning ( although fuzzy ) I stayed for the whole thing .
1 Many neglect that this is n't just a classic due to the fact that it 's the first 3D game , or even the first shoot-'em - up . It 's also one of the first stealth games , one of the only(and definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games , and just a pretty well - rounded gaming experience in general . With graphics that are terribly dated today , the game thrusts you into the role of B.J.(don't even * think * I 'm going to attempt spelling his last name ! ) , an American P.O.W. caught in an underground bunker . You fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes(but , let 's face it , most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon , surround you with Nazis and send you out to waste one of the Nazi leaders ) . The graphics are , as I mentioned before , quite dated and very simple . The least detailed of basically any 3D game released by a professional team of creators . If you can get over that , however(and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ) , then you 've got one heck of a good shooter / sneaking game . The game play consists of searching for keys , health and ammo , blasting enemies(aforementioned Nazis , and a " boss enemy " per chapter ) of varying difficulty(which , of course , grows as you move further in the game ) , unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms . There is a bonus count after each level is beaten ... it goes by how fast you were(basically , if you beat the ' par time ' , which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat , and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in , they are even challenging after many play - throughs ) , how much Nazi gold(treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed . Basically , if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned , you get a bonus , helping you reach the coveted high score placings . The game ( mostly , but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing ... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see . You can either run or walk , and amongst your weapons is also a knife ... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard , as is gunshots . Many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you , meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them ... nearly silently . In your inventory , you can get no less than four weapons and two keys ... more about the weapons later . The keys unlock certain doors . Most doors in the game are n't locked ... only two kinds need keys , and these keys are only introduced in later levels(you restart in levels , resetting weaponry , health , score and lives in each chapter ) . Much of the later game is spent looking for them . Now , as I just alluded to , this game , like many of the period(late 80 's , early 90 's ) , is based on collecting extra lives ... personally , I think it 's completely and utterly useless(it was mercifully dropped from here on end ... I think ( ? ) , from the next 3D shooter and onwards ) , since you can save anytime you want and ' using a life ' resets weaponry , health and ammo , like starting on a new chapter(which is a real pain in later levels , where you * need * heavier artillery ) . Now , I shall beat around the bush no longer ... moving on to the guns ! You start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close ) and a pistol ... nothing special , but good for conserving ammo , unlike the next two bad boys . Your third weapon is a German SMG ... a sub - machine - gun . It 's faster and automatic , and some later enemies use it . And the last one ... is nothing short of a Gatling gun ! Oh yeah ! Think T2 . Think Predator . Think about unloading massive amounts of lead into Nazi fiends with such a gun . It 's every bit as entertaining as it sounds . Most of the boss enemies use this , though , so be prepared . I wo n't reveal the identities of these boss enemies , however ... that 's for each player to discover for him(or her)self . The sound is excellent ... very crisp and realistic . As you hear the tear of a machine - gun firing , the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a Nazi yelling surprised or a warning in German , you truly feel like you are there , trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems . That segues me nicely into the level design ... as you run through seemingly countless , nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further , you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood . I almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep , lots of humidity and unusual warmth ... ) from playing . Though the level of detail is n't terribly high , what there is is great . Remains of victims , guards ' quarters and countless Nazi symbols ... the list goes on . The game also features quite a bit of gore ... for it 's limited graphics engine , John Romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game . What is there left to say ... the first of its kind , and it 's no wonder this spawned countless others 3D shooters . Sure , weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such ) did n't come around until the next entry into the genre ... Doom ... and it was Duke Nukem 3D that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right , adding vertical dimensions to it ) , and jumping did n't come around until a third , later title(the first Quake , possibly ? Fellow gamers , help me out here ) ... but all of those games , as well as the rest of the genre , owe their existence to this one . So load up the Luger , open the door to enter the bunker and step into B.J. 's shoes ... he deserves the recognition , even(or maybe even especially ? ) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared . I recommended this to all fans of 3D games . 8/10
1 You play as B.J. Blazkowicz , a US secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover Nazi secret and turn the tide of World War II . That means everything from breaking out of a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler 's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the most influential game of its time . That 's because it literally inspired obsession . Many games existed at the time and even more do today , but every so often you get a real grabber . This is one of them . Just like Tetris before it and more recently GTA III in 2002 . Yes , Doom is better in almost every respect , but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming 's biggest tidal waves were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz . The Space Marine , Duke Nukem , Max Payne , Serious Sam , John Mullins , JC Denton , Agent 47 , Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at ID . Whether directly or , in most cases , indirectly , but they still do.<br /><br />Even with its old look , very aged graphics , super simple gameplay ( this is really a game , games now border on the " experience level " ) and highly rectangular levels , the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun . Especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.<br /><br />Also : " Halt ! " * bang ! bang ! bang ! * " AARRRGH ! ! ! " never grows old . --- 8/10<br /><br />Voluntarily rated PC-13 for " profound carnage . " However , it 's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today .
1 Sherman , set the wayback machine for ... 1986 . The United States was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession , while Japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom . Manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the US economy , and factory workers were a good example of the " average American " . The word " downsizing " had n't entered the general vocabulary yet , but everyone knew the phenomenon . Bruce could be heard on the radio singing , " Foreman says these jobs are going , boy , and they ai n't coming back to your hometown . " Chrysler had just been bailed out by Uncle Sam . Bumper stickers could be seen saying " Buy American -- the job you save may be your own." < br /><br />"Gung Ho " does a better job of capturing the mood of the American industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period . Certainly the movie has its flaws -- some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe . But the story really is about the meeting of East and West : Keaton 's Hunt Stevenson personifies America , brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath . Watanabe 's Kazuhiro personifies Japan , on top of the heap with a successful system , but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals . The movie 's plot , flawed as it is , simply provides a framework for the conflict , and eventually synthesis , of their two personalities.<br /><br />Keaton 's acting overshadows everyone else 's , and practically makes the movie by itself . I 've always admired Keaton for his ability to deliver lines that feel improvised , no matter what script he 's following . His character , Hunt Stevenson , is a likable , affable everyman , a natural leader with a wise - ass streak . But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us : he does n't want to disappoint anyone . He 'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes , and even lie , rather than point out the ugly truth.<br /><br />Kazuhiro is the mirror image of Stevenson : shy and introspective , but also , because of his Japanese upbringing , reluctant to be the bearer of bad news . The scene in which Stevenson first comes to Kazuhiro with the employees ' grievances captures perfectly the Japanese approach to workplace conflict . Kazuhiro replies to Stevenson 's complaints with " I understand what you are saying , " but wo n't refuse his requests out loud . Stevenson misinterprets this as agreement , and goes away saying , " Okay , we 've got that settled . " ( This is still a problem in Japanese - American business relations in the 21st century!)<br /><br />Ultimately , Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem : get the factory working smoothly , meet production goals , and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them . In working towards this goal , they each have to take a page from the others ' book . Kazuhiro 's family becoming more " Americanized " is an obvious example . Also note that Stevenson thinks it 's odd when Kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them -- and yet , later in the movie , Stevenson does exactly that himself.<br /><br />The plot and its resolution are a little cornball , but hey , this is a comedy . If you can overlook the movie 's flaws , there is a great story about self - realization and open - mindedness here .
1 Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again . Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville . What happens after that is one hilarious moment after another . The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together . Look for great performances from Keaton , Gedde Watanabe , George Wendt , Mimi Rogers , John Turturro , Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo . All are perfectly cast . Do n't be fooled by the low number rating . This is a 7.5 in my book . It is interesting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon . Yes , there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon .
1 I think it great example of the differences between two cultures . It would be a great movie to show in a sociology class . I thought it was pretty funny and I must say that i am a sucker for that " lets band together and get the job done " plot device . It seems most people do n't realize that this movie is not just a comedy . It has a few dramatic elements in it as well and I think they blend in nicely . Overall , I give it a solid 8 .
1 Surprised to see the rather low score for this movie . Just saw this film for the first time in 10 years , and was reminded why I like it.<br /><br />Come back with me , children , to a time when Michael Keaton was a straight - up comedy guy , and you might find some joy in this film . It 's a gentle comedy -- the kind Ron Howard specializes in -- but if that 's your thing , you should check this out . Keaton 's low - key charm is just right for this project.<br /><br />"Gung Ho " is a bit dated , because it takes places in the last stage of the pre - global economy world , when it still mattered what country a business was based in . That said , it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other , to great benefit.<br /><br />You could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked , but that 's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs . It 's like an I.V. drip . And I mean that in a good way .
1 A very funny east - meets - west film influenced by the closure of GM 's Flint , Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US . Set in western Pennsylvania , it features great performances by Michael Keaton , Gedde Watanabe , and George Wendt . Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan .
1 This is a wonderful movie with a fun , clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what 's important in life make this a very under - appreciated movie . Do n't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this . Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated , because actors like Keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy . Great movie all around !
1 This comedy is bound to be good from the get - go . East meets west and east does n't want to lose ... west does n't know what losing is like . It starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it does n't let go . This is definitely worth seeing .
1 Wow , it 's been years since I last saw this movie . Watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986 . Initially I did n't ' think I would make it through the movie . Hunt Stevenson ( Michael Keaton ) was so obnoxious , arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch him . He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans . If that was n't bad enough , once the small American town 's finest workers were shown the image only got worse . On the opposite spectrum the Japanese were presented as emotionless , robotic workaholics . The movie was n't even all that funny , I only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it . And I 'm glad I continued the watch.<br /><br />Just like boxing , judges are swayed by how you finish the round . This movie went from about a three up to the seven I rated it because of the ending . The end was excellent . You always want a harmonious ending and this was just that . It was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory , but what was most special was the marriage between the Japanese customs and values and the American customs and values . It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note .
1 Way , way back in the 1980s , long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities , the United States and Japan were at each other 's throat in the world manufacturing race . Remember sayings like ' Union Yes ! , ' ' the Japanese are taking this country over , ' and ' Americans are lazy?'<br /><br />As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace , director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash ' Gung Ho , ' which drew over $ 36 million in U.S. box office receipts . While in many ways dated , Howard 's tongue - in - cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.<br /><br />'Gung Ho ' focuses on Hunt Stevenson ( Michael Keaton ) , the automakers union rep from Hadleyville , a small , depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania . Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo ( similar to real - life Toyota ) , which is considering a U.S. operation at the town 's empty plant . With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse , Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line.<br /><br />The 112 minutes of ' Gung Ho ' is a humorous look at these two sides , with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered : on one hand , an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism ; on the other hand , Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self - worth . In Stevenson , we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings . With the survival of his workers ' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line , Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance , although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble . Besides answering to the heads of Assan , we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members , many of whom he grew up with . This includes Buster ( George Wendt ) , Willie ( John Turturro ) , and Paul ( Clint Howard , Ron 's brother).<br /><br />The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe , also known for ' Sixteen Candles ' and ' Volunteers . ' Watanabe plays Kazihiro , the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life . He is constantly shadowed by Saito ( Sab Shimono ) , the nephew of Assan 's CEO who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order . While given a light touch , these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture.<br /><br />With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script , Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work . ' Gung Ho ' is indeed a slam - dunk success for Keaton , who also teamed with Ron Howard in 1994 's ' The Paper . ' He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included ' Mr. Mom , ' ' Beetle Juice , ' and ' The Dream Team ' before venturing into ' Batman , ' ' One Good Cop , ' and ' My Life . ' It 's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe 's performance as the odd man out , who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top - notch , including Wendt , Turturro , Shimono , and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto . Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey , Hunt 's girlfriend . Edwin Blum , Lowell Ganz , and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho 's solid writing . The incidental music , which received a BMI Film Music Award , was composed by Thomas Newman . Gung Ho 's soundtrack songs are wall - to - wall 80s , including ' Do n't Get Me Wrong , ' ' Tuff Enuff , ' and ' Working Class Man.'<br /><br />The success of ' Gung Ho ' actually led to a short - lived TV series on ABC . While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago , Ron Howard 's film still has its comic value . It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad short - changed . Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround , English Dolby surround , and French ' dubbing , ' but subtitles are in English only . There are no extras , not even the theatrical trailer . On the plus side , Paramount 's digital transfer is quite good , with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound . While a few extras would have been helpful - especially that ' Gung Ho ' was a box office success - there 's little to complain about the film presentation itself.<br /><br / > * * * out of 4
1 I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class . Were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality(of the product ) . I did rent this one back in the eighties and I remember it to be good(but not great)movie . I 've always liked Michael Keaton 's style and delivery . He was a perfect fit for the movie.<br /><br />I am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie . I grant you yes it 's no Oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value . It 's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all - out comedy farce . I also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences . I beg to differ . I grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is Hollywood film not a documentary . From what I 've read about differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time.<br /><br />Some of the basic differences were that Japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole . Teamwork was emphasized . They perhaps made the company above all else . Where American workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship . The individual was more important than the company . I 'll probably get some hate email over that comment I 'm sure.<br /><br />Another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix . In many Japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered . Rather as one character in the movie put it " it was the dealers(meaning car dealer ) problem".<br /><br />Many of these things are probably dated but I 'm sure some are still around as many US car makers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese . If one is more interested in the subject of American , European and Japanese automakers I can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period . The book is called " The machine that changed the world " by James Womack , Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos . It 's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers . Parts are bit dry but I think you 'll find that it backs up much the movie also .
1 this is a great film!!!<br /><br />I first saw this film when it came out . I just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it . A lot of films we watched when we were younger do n't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life . The film is actually a great 80 's example of the type of films made then . Keaton is at his best , all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it . The pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80 's is too funny . Being from the 80 's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again . The film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80 's film lovers .
1 Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching . Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine , & he is absolutely hilarious in this movie . Matching him step for step is Gedde Watanabe . The two of them work wonderfully together . Although this movie is a comedy , I also like how it shows Hunt ( Keaton ) & Kazihiro ( Watanabe ) struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups . They both try so hard to keep the peace , & then they finally get into a fight ( which is hysterical to watch ) . First , they 're both on the floor . Then Hunt jumps on a chair . Kazihiro jumps on the desk . Hunt jumps on the desk with him . The fight then spills out from the office into the factory . I love that after they are separated by the workers , you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand . Also , there is a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro . He is at his house & his boss from Japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow : < br /><br />Kazihiro : Tomorrow not good day . Sakamoto : Why not ? Kazihiro : Factory is locked & we ca n't find key.<br /><br />Tell me you ca n't picture Michael Keaton saying something like that!<br /><br />I guess I really like this movie because it is genuinely funny , & also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other , but become good friends as well .
1 I saw this movie when it was new . Later I rented it in Japan after having been here three years , afraid that I would cringe when I viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience . The movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between Japan and Pennsylvania ( where I 'm from ) . Not all the stuff is factually spot on , but the tone is perfect.<br /><br />I'm still in Japan many years later , and I continue to enjoy this film for its even - handed treatment of the two sides in the story . Interestingly , although the Japanese - American actors spoke Japanese in the original , the dialog is redubbed in the Japan version to cover up obvious second - language delivery problems.<br /><br />I noticed one reviewer uses this in a Japanese class . I think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with Japan by watching this film than by reading any of the " serious " books on the matter ( most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing Japanese companies).<br /><br />Don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one - star reviewers who , among other things , found it implausible that the Japanese would want to build cars in the US . ( Of course , the Japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction . ) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés , like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music . Michael Keaton has never been funnier .
1 I recently saw this movie in my International Business class . I was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary ( not to say I do n't love documentary I 've just hard bad luck with movies in that class ) Imagine my surprise when this movie , that 's actually a movie , came up . < br /><br />This film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere . The culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call . I would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh , because yes it is funny . < br /><br />Well , that 's about it ! Cheers
1 I teach Japanese for an online high school and I include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language . And watching " Gung Ho " is one of the requirements . The students can either buy or rent the movie . Stereotypes or not , this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do . Many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much , they are going to get a copy for themselves . It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture . I just wish I could get a cleaned - up TV version . I 'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time .
1 I just have to throw my two cents in . Relax , it 's a comedy . Yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted . I ca n't think of many comedies where they are n't . This is n't a new release , it 's out on video and airs on cable almost every week . Would I see it in a theater ? Sure , I did , when it first came out . It 's funny ... that should be enough.<br /><br />Even if I did n't like it at all I 'd still watch it on cable for Michael Keaton . He 's an underrated and under - appreciated actor . I ca n't think of another who is so capable in every genre . Nor can I think of one who 's as successful . A comedic actor who 's also an action star(short lived but still ) , who 's also a romantic lead , who 's also a dramatic actor ; a villain and a hero . I ca n't think of any , at least not in Hollywood . Certainly none who have been successful at all those genres . I mean there 's Tom Cruise but to me he 's better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character . However this is n't about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise so I 'll move on.<br /><br />Gung Ho is worth renting , heck it 's worth buying since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal - Mart . It 's worth watching on cable(if you have cable or satellite ) . It 's one of those fun to watch movies . You can put your brain on pause , and just relax , and chuckle away.<br /><br />To ask for more , in my honest opinion , is asking too much .
1 I remember watching " Gung Ho " as a child with my mother , and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes . I , of course , found the entire movie hilarious , particularly the mannerisms of the characters . It was n't until I was much older and watched it again that I realized how much deeper this show actually is.<br /><br />Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators . Keaton ceases to amaze me with his real - life style of line delivery , and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix . I also thought that Patti Yasutake ( Umeki ) was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief.<br /><br />I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s . We can all learn a lesson from the merging of the American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes you really * can * have " the best of both worlds . " And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments . I 'd rather have one of those cars , too .
1 I really enjoyed this movie . Typically Ron Howard who seems to like being associated with Michael Keaton . Love the scene when Hunt travels to Japan with his sales pitch . Whoa , how did that get in there ! Cheap laughs but great value
1 Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time . The result is uneven , but generally entertaining . Keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well . Wantabedde is even better . One warning : George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role . Otherwise , this is quite enjoyable time capsule .
1 This is hardly a movie at all , but rather a real vaudeville show , filmed for the most part " in proscenium " , and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day . " Singing in the Bathtub " is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen-- be sure to wear your shower cap !
1 It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary . At times there is almost a desperation , as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound , surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside ( as did happen to some ) , Rin - Tin - Tin . however , was pertfectly natural . In such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences , some were sure to stand out John Barrymore 's soliloquy from Richard II is a moment certainly worth preserving . By and large , only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence . However , this is over all reasonably entertaining , and a must for " film buffs " especially interested in the silent to sound transition
1 This is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that Warner Bros could afford . ... and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s , an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties ' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance . THE SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic . Vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan - dance after ukulele lunacy after Rin Tin Tin who introduces ' an oriental number ' ... ( ! ) ... and on and on it lumbers , grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality Vitaphone sound . It is far too long , but among it 's delirious delights are the awesome " Singin in the Bathtub " number created on a scale of which The QE2 architects would be proud ... Beatrice Lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty , Nick Lucas , and the never - ending grand finale in two color color ... which is all set to the song LADY LUCK . . So keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en - ter - tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort . Row after row of " Doll " characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor . I kid you not , there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers , mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes , unable to move ( for days , I imagine , during production ) whilst this katzenjammer of toy - box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the Ukulele orchestra . Of course I loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions . And so should you ... and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill . It is all so demented .
1 It is very hard to rate this film . As entertainment value for 21st century viewers , it fails miserably . However , for the student of early sound films and history , it is a jewel . " Show of Shows " was a revue filmed to compete with MGM 's successful " Hollywood Revue of 1929 " , which still survives intact complete with its Technicolor scenes.<br /><br />The purpose of the all - star revue was to showcase a particular studio 's silent stars in speaking roles , and show that they could make the transition . However , Warner Bros. seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they did n't even have under long - term contract such as Ben Turpin , Lloyd Hamilton , Beatrice Lillie , and even a marching band . Meanwhile , their biggest talent - Al Jolson - is noticeably absent . Even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in . Almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so Vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity . The finale is also overly long , but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers.<br /><br />The highlights of the film are two numbers from Winnie Lightner - " Pingo Pongo " and " Singin in the Bathtub " , a couple of numbers with Nick Lucas , John Barrymore performing Shakespeare , and the Chinese Fantasy " Li Po Li " with Nick Lucas and Myrna Loy . This last number is the only part of the film that survives in Technicolor , and it really is quite attractive . Reasonably enough , the players in these good acts were long - term Warner Bros. stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them.<br /><br />This film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history - the year 1929 , which was the bridge year between two eras - the silent and sound eras , and the roaring 20 's and the Great Depression . Just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast , as Warner Bros. would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave Warner Bros. its distinctive urban look and feel - James Cagney , Joan Blondell , Edward G. Robinson , and others .
1 Thanks to Warner Archive , I can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink . ( The bathtub , however is present . ) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time . If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some , it is because they were big in the silent days , and most faded with the popularity of the talkies . There are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well . You will be most impressed with Winnie Lightner , who performs two numbers . Also there is that French star , Irene Bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner . Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two - strip Technicolor " Chinese Fantasy , " which has been restored for this version . It is truly beautiful and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas . Finally , there is the massive " Lady Luck " finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour . This is truly an epic of the early - talkie era . Any old - movie buff will love this .
1 Watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago , and now that I 've found it again it still has a film experience like few others . If risky , it 's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids . While it still holds up as an adult , I was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago . Trying to find it today is hard enough . . . but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age . Anime fans especially will find this a great entry to Masami Hata 's filmography . With impressive art work and unique designs , " Chirin No Suzu " represents a worthwhile experience . While some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in English , the musical score is nevertheless captivating . But even the voice acting is far better than much released today . Unfortunately is went out of print in the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video , and has not received any new format release to my knowledge , at least in the US . Look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied ! It 's an artful , intense , enjoyable , and important landmark in Japanese animation .
1 I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart ! No other story had such a unfinished ending ... I grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites , because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness , and cruelty , and loneliness , and life , and choices that ca n't be undone , and the need for others . Chirin is made alone when the Wolf kills his mother , but the Wolf is alone , too , when Chirin follows him into the mountain . The Wolf does n't kill the lamb , even though each night he says " maybe I 'll eat you tomorrow . " The tape of it I have is broken and degraded from age and use . I will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as I did as a child . Stories like this , with this depth and feeling , and this intricacy of meaning , are very rare . It is a sad story , but I 've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made . I am glad I have seen this movie , and I 'm glad I saw it as a child .
1 in a not so conventional sense of the word.<br /><br />This movie was one of my favorites as a young child , and I just recently remembered it , and thought to look it up . While many of the details are no longer clear in my mind , the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years.<br /><br />If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes , then I highly recommend this movie . It taught me a lot about life and death , and brought forth in me a lot of emotion . To this day , it remains one of my favorite films .
1 * * * Spoilers*<br /><br />My dad had taped this movie for me when I was 3 . By age 5 , I had watched it over 400 times . I just watched it and watched it . And I still do today ! It has a grim storyline , a lamb 's mother is killed by a wolf -- a very emotional scene -- and wants to become a wolf , like him . After years of training , the lamb is made into a really REALLY evil looking thing . He and the wolf travel to his old barn , but he can not kill the lambs , no matter how much he wishes to . He ends up killing the wolf , but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends , and ca n't return to his previous way of life.<br /><br />The art is beautiful , the songs are .. well , okay , and the voice acting is better than some things today.<br /><br />All in all , you just * have * to see this movie , it is a great masterpiece . Although , it 's very hard to find today.<br /><br / >
1 This is a fantasy movie for kids based on the Boggy Creek Legend although I do n't know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek as if it 's a sequel . This movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare . Dawn Wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid . Yes it 's very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8 - 12 y / o group which it targeted . It 's harmless G - rated kiddie fare and at least you do n't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it . Strictly for the 8 - 12 y / o set , older kids will get bored and think it lame .
1 i saw this movie when i was 13 and i really liked dana plato who later starred in different strokes as kimberly drummond . i do n't think it 's garbage .it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either . its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster . the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature .haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat . this is a good movie for kids , no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids .
1 This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful " The Legend of Boggy Creek " is a follow - up in name only . Stories abound in a sleepy , self - contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called " Big Bay Ty " that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek . Two bratty brothers and their older , more sensible tomboy sister ( a sweetly feisty performance by cute , pigtailed future " Different Strokes " sitcom star Dana Plato ) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being . The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry , bear - like , humongous , but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids ' rescue.<br /><br />Tom Moore 's casual , no - frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace , astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail , drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection , and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic , restrained , unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky - sappy mush . The adorable Dawn Wells ( Mary Ann on " Gilligan 's Island " ) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids ' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots . Robert Bethard 's capable , sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil , achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor . Darrell Deck 's score adeptly blends flesh - crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo - pluckin ' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew . In addition , this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90 's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance .
1 i totally disagree.i thought that this was a great movie for kids.dawn wells from gilligans island , and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato.it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no it was n't scary and was n't meant to be.i wo nt ruin the ending.but it was unusual the way that it was done.i mean the kids characters were great and i did n't know what to expect in the end.the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.it also helps them out of a jam towards the end.it also has the plus of not being overly long.i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes
1 This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos , and I have seen them all . As usual Lorre is his charming self as the debonair Mr. Moto . Lionel Atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator , the usual comic relief is quite funny here , and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye . It 's fast paced and fun.<br /><br />The archaeologist does n't have quite the same flair as Thomas Beck , the usual second lead in these programmers , but he 's adequate . Stepin Fetchit is on board , and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny , not demeaning to his intelligence , and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen .
1 A team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the Crown of the Queen of Sheeba . From Egypt , the crown is to be transferred via steamship to San Francisco . But it wo n't be an easy journey . There are plenty of would - be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown . Fortunately for all involved , Mr. Moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey . However , that does n't mean someone wo n't try to get their hands on the treasure.<br /><br />After the disappointment of Mr. Moto 's Gamble , I went into Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation hoping for the best , but , admittedly , fearing the worst . But within the first 10 seconds of the film , I knew I would find it more enjoyable . I 'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in Egypt . And seeing Moto disguised as a German archaeologist ( Imagine that , Peter Lorre playing a German ? ) , the beginning scenes really drew me in . While the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic San Francisco , it remained just as enjoyable . Dark , sinister characters lurking in the rainy night ; gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero 's head ; sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them ; and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that I love . And Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation 's got 'em all . A couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable Lionel Atwill in a nice little role , comic relief from G.P. Huntley that 's actually funny , and a return to form for Mr. Moto . I 've already mentioned his disguise in the movie 's opening scenes , well the athletic Moto comes out near the film 's finale . Moto is a like a Whirling Dervish of activity as he goes after his prey . All this and I have n't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by Lorre . Any way you look at it , Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation is a winner.<br /><br />As much as I hate that the Mr. Moto series had to end after this installment , it 's understandable when you think about it . WWII was just around the corner . And after Pearl Harbor , a movie with a Japanese hero would n't have gone over very well . At least the Mr. Moto series ended on a very positive note .
1 I generally love these 1930 mystery / police Charlie Chan type of movies , and this is no exception . However , something seems bad with this movie . A late attempt to switch from cerebral Moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet . A typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective , and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief . The plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today , but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real , but a commonplace occurrence .
1 A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia . There 's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes , but it works . The scares are very subtle , not the jump - cut scares that seem to populate most recent Asian horror films . The way the " scares " are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in " The Uninvited " ( aka 4 Inyong shiktak , directed by Su - Leon Lee ) , but this is n't nearly to the same caliber . The film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological . It 's not perfect , but it does what it 's supposed to do . I would recommend checking it out if you get a chance .
1 I liked this movie because it basically did more with less . It could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more ( though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop).<br /><br />The guy playing the DJ did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories . I also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny.<br /><br />While parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away , other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did.<br /><br />I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part , concentrating more on the living side of the equation . The last 5 - 10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed.<br /><br />While it was a shorter movie , it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story . Any more and it would have started to drag .
1 Like TALK RADIO , THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable ( TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in , THE BOOTH because of- let 's face it- the genre and the basic set - up ) . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , in this case . It means , in essence , that the filmmakers do n't punk out in the end the way they might 've in , say , an American version of this story . THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its ( foregone ) conclusion , but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well - travelled stretch of ( very scenic ) road . It reminds me of Harlan Ellison 's spooky short story , FLOP SWEAT . The claustrophobia is , at times , almost palpable . Worth a nice long look .
1 The Booth puts a whole new twist on your typical J - horror movie . This movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story . The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks.<br /><br />The story is about perception of the people who works , lives , and loves of our protagonist , and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station DJ booth . The story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash - backs as the movie runs its course , and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems . The movie mostly took place in a small , out - dated radio station 's studio with a very bad history , where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re - locating . It is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid . At time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co - workers or it was all in his mind . What I like about this film is that the film - makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did . This movie is a very smart , abide rather short 76 minutes film .

Operation Meteor . In a move to counter the Alliance 's tyranny , Rebel Forces from several colonies send new arsenals to Earth disguised as Shooting Stars ... <br /><br />However ... The Alliance forces catch on ... <br /><br />Gundam Wing is the most popular and most successful of the entire Gundam Series . With cutting - edge Anime animation , stunning action , amazing Mobile Suits , Breathtaking scripts , and some of the most unforgettable characters in Anime History.<br /><br />I'll try to explain the plot of Gundam Wing as best as possible . Earth has now colonized space , but the UESA forces have forcibly occupied them along with the help of the mysterious Elite Force OZ and their shadowy leaders , Treize Kushrenada and the Romefeller Foundation . Five pilots are sent to Earth piloting Mobile Suits with extraordinary power known as the Gundams .

1 Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the Fourth series in the continuing Gundam chronicles . Unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars , this one is a little different ; instead of having an army - vs .- army situation , this one is led by five teenage boys ( due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults ) and their machines called " Gundams " because of the metal alloy used in their construction . Which leads to problems , since gundams are supposed to be destroyed , replaced by " Mobile Suits " , which are piloted less - destructive weapon platforms and " Dolls " which are ran on A.I. and are used as grunt infantry.<br /><br />The whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives Gundam Wing an edge over a greater portion of the Anime that makes it 's way here . Especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines , such as Naruto , DragonBall , One Piece , DragonBall Z and InuYasha which are all from Shonen Jump , which is now available in America.<br /><br />Mobile Suit Gundam Wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over - the - top battles between mortals who more resemble gods , Gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully . Normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a " small " battle is to have it take a half - hour - something that would never happen in real life . Gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die , machines will be destroyed and rebuilt , battles will be lost and won , and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical.<br /><br />But the magic of Gundam Wing is in the details , and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having . Emotion . Instead of mythic prophecies , magic , or overblown martial arts , Gundam Wing is hard - line science fiction from a country that hates hard - line science fiction . ( NOTE : The author would like to state that Neon Genesis Evangelion is not hard - line - plausible - in - real - life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series ) they love Star Wars , but hate A.I. ( the movie ) . Henceforth why Gundam Wing was and Gundam SeeD is now in production for both Japanese and U.S. releases at the same time with two voice teams . American audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the Japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited SeeD episodes that air on Cartoon Network.<br /><br />The emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards . The heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of Earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing . This is not war , this is " total war " . Every person , every building , every street is a target for attack , both on Earth and off.<br /><br />My only complaint , and the reason it did n't get the score of ten , is that at about three - fourths of the way through , it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes , and no one really seems to change . Kind of like a present - time flashback , which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters , but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between Project : Meteor and OZ . But the final two episodes and the overplayed - on - Cartoon - Network ( back in 2001 - 2003 ) Mobile Suit Gundam Wing : Endless Waltz movie more than make up for the slack .
1 I have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes , I still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow , yet thoughtful actions of the story - telling . I am still a fan ..... with some minor pains.<br /><br />Though this installment into the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything(sound familiar ? ) , I have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow - dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly - ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans(especially the character called Wufei ... I mean he whines more than an American character on a soap opera . Get a counselor , will ya?)<br /><br />Besides for the over - exaggerated drama(I think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the English voice actors ) , this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again . I mean it can always be worse . It could be like the recent installment , SEED ...... eeeewwww , talk about mellow - dramatic .... I'll chat about that one later .
1 Since the title is in English and IMDb lists this show 's primary language as English , i shall concentrate on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing(2000 ) as presented in the Bandai released DVD set . My actual review for the whole series is under IMDb 's entry of " " Shin kidô senki Gundam W"(1995).<br /><br />Very little is changed in respect to plot , script and characterization its adaptation to English and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in . Purists can stick to Japanese all they want , but for a more " realistic " experience i recommend the English track since all the characters , except Heero Yuy , are not Japanese.(most of them are Caucasian in fact with a couple of non - Japanese Asians . ) For one thing , the characters ' personalities come across more " directly " than in the Japanese version . The contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give - or - take performances but a very well cast group of actors.<br /><br />Wing Gundam 's pilot Heero Yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity . Voiced by Mark Hildreth who 's deadpan delivery can be criticized as " bad acting " but it matches Heero 's personality very well.<br /><br />Deathscythe Gundam 's Duo Maxwell , ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends . He is possibly the best acted character in the whole show , masterfully played by Scott McNeil . He may sound a little too old for his age , but Duo 's English voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal Japanese one.<br /><br />Trowa , the pilot of Heavyarms , is a lost lonely soul who 's only purpose so far has been combat ; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him , he only knows how to kill , not to befriend . Kirby Morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as Trowa Barton.<br /><br />Quatre Rebarba Winner is voiced by Brad Swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand . A huge plus point is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl(and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the Japanese version ) but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy.<br /><br />The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang voiced by Ted Cole may seem a little over - the - top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of Heero and Trowa.<br /><br />Relena Darlian sounds older in English , voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey . This might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story , her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development.<br /><br />Zechs Merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the Japanese version . Both voices bring out different sides to the same character . His Japanese voice is haughty , authoritative and commands respect , keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature . His English voice by Brian Drummond is more subdued , sounding more devious and " snake - like " , highlighting Zechs ' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals.<br /><br />The members of OZ are a mixed bag really . Treize Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye is given a more realistic and down - to - earth performance compared to his larger - than - life Japanese style of speaking . However , Lady Une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ......... bored most of the time . The cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either.<br /><br />I would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds . The Maganac Corp 's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents . The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would have also sounded better with some classy European accent that reflects their status of nobility.<br /><br />Despite underwhelming acting from the side characters , the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over - the - top and more realistic rendition of Gundam Wing 's script . Very faithful to the original Japanese script , keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics , war and human nature . Sadly , it also retains the flaws of the original Japanese script .
1 Gundam Wing is a fun show . I appreciate it for getting me into Gundam and anime in general . However , after watching its predecessors , such as Mobile Suit Gundam , Zeta Gundam , and even G Gundam , I find Wing to be Gundam Lite.<br /><br />Characters : An aspect long held by Gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity . This does not happen in Wing . Heero is top dog at the beginning , and he 's top dog at the end . Personalities do not change , growth is never achieved . The best character is Zechs , who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series . But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Mecha : Wing has great suit designs . The Gundams are super cool , with the Epyon being my favorite . I even consider a few of the OZ suit designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon suits . But sweet suit designs does n't quite save the series from boring characters.<br /><br />Conclusion : In the end , Wing has cool fight scenes , though riddled with recycled animation , but shallow plot and character development . Enjoyable , but not moving like previous Gundam outings .
1 I 'm not a big fan of most anime , but Gundam Wing is truly something else . Gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime , since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits , Gundam Wing gets right down to business . < br /><br />Gundam Wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series . Large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war , not only the battles . Though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate , individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements . < br /><br />To my knowledge , this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000 , and then professionally dubbed by them too . the dubbing is simply flawless . not only does every word said match up , but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable . many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in English , but i simply do n't have the determination to do that . < br /><br />Not only are the voices good , but the score used over the series is quite impressive . I 'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack . < br /><br />The plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers , and no , not hook you like some prime time drama like Lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you . explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers , since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series . The rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace . Thus a war is started , leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations . I feel that any more detail would begin to give away information , which is crucial to the plot . < br /><br />I'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime , anyone that thinks ALL anime is stupid ( they have good reason to think so ) , and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it .
1 Gundam Wing is an amazing show from start to finish , every single episode is a joy to watch . The story is typical Gundam fare , in the future Earth 's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand . The story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other Gundam show . It is the year After Colony 195 and the corrupt Earth government , known as the Earth Sphere Alliance , is violently taking over the free colonies . To combat the Alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come ( an evil militaristic organization hiding within the Alliance known as OZ , which later takes control of Earth and the colonies ) , select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to Earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come . These mechs , known as Gundams , fight OZ and try to regain peace in the colonies as OZ takes the front - stage , completely eliminating the Alliance and taking control of Earth and its colonies.<br /><br />Gundam Wing as I previously stated , is probably the most enjoyable Gundam series to watch in my opinion . A large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other Gundam series before it , but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other Gundam series . Gundam Wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other Gundam show I have ever seen thus far . This particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle . Now do n't get me wrong , this show still has many epic battles within it , and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other Gundam series have , but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1.<br /><br />No matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable Gundam series out there , and I strongly recommend it to any fan of anime , or sci - fi in general . The show sports some amazing animation and superb action , but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more . The characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them . This show is definitely one that should n't be missed.<br /><br />A perfect 10/10 !
1 Gundam Wing to me happens to be a good anime . A bit slow moving ( especially around the middle of the series ) , but over all enjoyable . Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a " winger " , I will admit that I have watched all of the original Gundam , Gundam 0080 and 0083 , The 08th MS Team , and Gundam SEED.<br /><br />I will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be " rip - offs " ( i.e. Zechs Marquise to the original Gundam 's Char ) , but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series , as is SEED.<br /><br />If you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original Gundam first , and then know that you are watching an AU series .
1 I 've watched almost all of the Gundam / Mech anime that have showed in the US and this by far has the best story . The way its plot twists and turns has u riveted . Gundam Wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war . The series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as Gundams . The Gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as Oz . As things begin to heat up between OZ and the Gundam pilots , new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate . Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise . To obtain peace the Gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting . But , how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal . I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot .
1 While being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the Gundam Wing series , upon re - watching the series , I have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated , but the plot , the gundam design , character design , and character depth are masterfully executed . While at first appearing like a boy band of sorts , the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art , with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters . Consequently , it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character . Personally , I liked Heero because of his stoic personality . While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood , I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general ( how can we obtain peace ? ) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits , which , to say the least , is excellent .
1 The second alternate Gundam universe tale ( G - Gundam being the first ) , Gundam Wing is yet another different view into the Gundam verse . The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts . The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization . In truth , the series does n't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict , the Eve Wars , do n't happen until the later episodes . < br /><br />The greatest positives of this series are it 's characters . All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in . Another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series . The designs put some of it 's other Gundam counterparts to shame . < br /><br />One of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard UC fans claim rip off of the original UC saga . Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is beyond me . True there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well.<br /><br />Take for example , the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable . Throughout the series , Zechs is more the outcast in the Alliance and in ways OZ as well , while the Red Comet was shining symbol of Zeon . Another big difference is the fact Zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he 's given in the early episodes : " Killer of his own men . " Char is n't given this label . < br /><br />The problems with this series is n't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems . The first is the reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks . Sure it 's fun seeing Heavy Arms attack tanks , MS , and planes the first time . But on it 's fourth re - use scenes like this do get old . < br /><br />The second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year . If you really think about all the events springing in the series , a lot happens in just one lone year . < br /><br />But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro 's first lines every so often . As it ranks , this is probably the best of the Alternate universe Gundam tales and a great introduction into the Gundam world . After all , this was the very first Gundam anime to air in the US television .
1 I could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in Gundam Wing , they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts . Instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of Anime bliss.<br /><br />It contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months ... years , and then go back to and derive new meaning from , a masterpiece in script writing ( even though it has the typical Anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and English dub ) . It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.<br /><br />The relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series . The relationship between Heero and Relena , and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch . The apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love ( a word never mentioned in the series ) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment . The women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely , if at all see , which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic . It takes Heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring , but he gets there , and when he does , its a big pay off . < br /><br />And then there 's the giant robot fighting . Fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any Hollywood epic fight scene . Any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids , as has become clear when I 'm trying to recommend this series to my friends , but they 're wrong . Many of the giant robot fights in Gundam Wing contain a hefty dose of pathos , usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.<br /><br />The constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring , it is a captivating , thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body .
1 Over - powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - Check ! Weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - Check ! Mobile suits based on angels - Check!<br /><br />OK - its a Gundam series . This one , Gundam Wing , has good character development , real - world complexity , interesting ideas and some pretty eye - candy.<br /><br />With characters , the initially weak Relena Dorlan ( later Peacecraft , then back to Dorlan ) gets stronger and more independent ( although is still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy , the series main character ) . The aforementioned Heero , initially a cold , hard butcherer , becomes more and more human , while still remaining in - character . And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft ( who s nomm de guerre is Zechs Marquise ) float between OZ , freelance , and command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations.<br /><br />The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works . However , in 49 half - hour episodes , it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity is n't used to its full potential.<br /><br />The ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting , the desire for peace , etc - are ones that resonate even today . In retrospect , the series was ahead of its time , what with the " War on Terrorism " and all . But its exploration of these ideas , the monologues , especially those of Treize Kushrenada , is an incredible dramatic piece , forming some of the best writing in the series.<br /><br />But that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor , which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge.<br /><br />In terms of eye - candy , which is what this one has in bucketloads , everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra ( No not the tampons you idiot ! ) is wells designed , and explodes in big balls of orange ( which is bad , because better animation would 've had better explosions ) . But who cares ? ! Stuff explodes , and that s all that matters.<br /><br />In short though , the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes , you 've missed out on a lot . The poor writing can leave you cringing , and sometimes the animation makes you go " WTF ? ! ? ! " But this is made up for in its classic animation style , its scale , sparks of incredible dialogue , and its more mature exploration that one expects of such Japenese animations .
1 How I got into it : When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network , I have to say that I 've never seen anything like this , and it was the best . But when I started collecting the series on VHS , and years later on DVD part of Bandai 's Anime Legends collections . It was amazing , and truly worth watching . It had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat . And of course , the theme songs " Just Communication",and Rhythm Emotions " were the best.<br /><br />Characters , and Gundams : My favorite characters in the show were : Heero , Duo , Relena , Treize , Lady Und , Noin , and Zechs . My favorite Gundams in the show that I liked the most are the Wing Zero , and Epyon , and of course the Altron , and Deathscythe I , and II.<br /><br />Meaning of the show : What this series also tells us that in real life , wars are very hard and we can sometimes win , or lose . But peace can also be hard to obtain , and I do believe the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing , and are trying to obtain world peace.<br /><br />But however , this show is truly the best of the best . So in closing to this review , after you watch this show , see the Movie Endless Waltz .
1 Was'nt really bad for Raw 's first PPV of 006 . But the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home.<br /><br />FIRST MATCH- RIC FLAIR VS . EDGE W/ LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener , these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match . Flair wins by DQ after Edge slams him with his MITB briefcase . 3/10 SECOND MATCH- TRISH STRATUS VS . MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN 'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these Divas faced off in the ring together . Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick , but Trish ducks & nails her own Chick Kick for the win to retain her title . 3/10 THIRD MATCH- TRIPLE H VS . BIG SHOW Seriously good this match was , really . The whole match HHH focuses on Big Show 's injured arm but Big Show still fights back . Later HHH is able to topple down Big Show & nails a Pedigree for the win . 5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W/ MAMA VS . VISCERA { This was a bonus match } Not that bad , it was alright . After Viscera was down , behind the referee , Benjamin 's mama got a purse { Which had bricks in it } & slammed Viscera on the head with it three times . Viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by Benjamin for the win against the big man . 4/10<br /><br />FIFTH MATCH- JERRY ' THE KING ' LAWLER VS . GREGORY HELMS Boring , slow & sloppy . Both men did n't really put a very good effort . Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win . 2/10<br /><br />SIXTH MATCH- TORRIE Wilson VS . VICTORIA VS . ASHLEY VS . MARIA VS . CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST EVER WOMEN 'S GAUNTLET MATCH It was pretty entertaining to me . Ashley { I think } eliminates Candice last to win the first ever Women 's Gauntlet match . 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA VS . CHRIS MASTERS VS . CARLITO VS . SHAWN MICHAELS VS . KANE VS . KURT ANGLE W/ DAIVARI IN AN ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool Elimination chamber match . But nothing will top last year 's Elimination Chamber which was the best . The last three are Masters , Cena & Carlito . Carlito turns his back on Masters & gets a roll - up on him to eliminate him . Seconds later Cena gets a roll - up on Carlito for the three count to win the Elimination Chamber & retain his WWE Title . But his night was not over yet . 7/10 After the match , Vince McMahon comes out & congratulates Cena for his victory . Vince McMahon states that his night is not over yet , & says that Edge cashes in his Money In The Bank opportunity to challenge Cena for the title . Edge comes out with Lita , gives the briefcase to Vince & heads off in the ring as Cena has one more match to go here tonight.<br /><br />EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS . EDGE W/ LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP { Cena who is busted open during the Chamber match } gets pounded straight away by Edge , Edge then nails a Spear on Cena , goes for the cover & to his shock Cena breaks out . Edge nails another Spear & covers for the shocking three count as he has beat Cena & has won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career . 1/10 So last year 's New Years Revolution was better than this year 's , but it was still alright . The EC match was also good & the shocking of Edge cashing in his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the PPV show.<br /><br />Overall : I 'll give it 7/10 & a C
1 I became a fan of the TV series ` Homicide : Life on the Street ' late in the show 's run , but became a fan very quickly . It was a cop show unlike any other : visually different in its use of hand - held cameras , taking the viewer everywhere , with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities , and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department , including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface . < br /><br />Homicide : The Movie , the reunion follow - up to the series , is as good as a made - for - television film can be . After Lt . Giardello ( Yaphet Kotto ) , now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore , is shot , the series ' cast members are back to help find the killer . In addition , the cast members who left the force and those who died , also manage to have their place in the film . The intensity and fire that marked the series return , and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series . All in all , a terrific TV movie.<br /><br />Vote : 9
1 I have always been a huge fan of " Homicide : Life On The Street " so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up , I could n't wait.<br /><br />Let me just say , I was not disappointed at all . It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I 've ever seen . It was great to see everyone back again , but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back , because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of an all - together great show .
1 I went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift , who was made into a monster by society . Suffice to say I was expecting something entirely different from what I got . But it was a happy surprise . My friend and I both thought the movie was very romantic ( the fact that the male lead is n't bad to look at surely helped ) , and there was enough plot development , action and even humor ( the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other 's name had the whole movietheatre laughing ) to keep you entertained and invested in the story . So in short : Not what I expected , but a very good surprise indeed . I 'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD .
1 A woman borough a boy to this world and was alone . They both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm . There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this " gift " - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body . First he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time . Then he grows up and decides to find his real father . Just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice .... but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right 'cause it is not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha ( he is the main hero acted by Artem Tkachenko ) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs . In such a runaway from authorities and Mafia he meets a girl ( acted by Chulpan Hamatova ) and falls in love with her . Everything else is to be watched ... not told . Be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions . This film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life .
1 For everyone who expects a traditional superhero - movie it might be an unpleasant surprise . It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie . It focuses mainly on emotions and it 's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.<br /><br />That 's because Sasha , like each superhero , takes the law into his own hands and the society does n't appreciate it . Sasha becomes an outlaw . While on the run , he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.<br /><br />As you can see , the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics . It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma . Everything happens very slowly . However , when there 's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what 's going on , it 's all over . But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action . What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha 's actions , which are mostly very drastic . The score is very scarce , which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film . So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.<br /><br />Is the film worth it ? That is a question really difficult to answer . I do n't think that this experience enriched me so very much , but somehow I keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again . Mostly due to the atmosphere , which is really dense , but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope . After all they 're young people , who have all their lives to live . So no matter how hard it gets there 's always a slight joyous tune when they are together .
1 This movie has great style , fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman . It falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme .. but all in all , I would recommend this movie just because it has that good old Russian feel to it .. big , impressive , powerful , bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty.<br /><br />PLOT : A guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will ( not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer ) when he is REALLY mad at you tries to have a girlfriend .. he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand , it 's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship .... <br /><br />Sword boy is on the planet for a reason .. he just does n't know what it is .. YET.<br /><br />Lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively.<br /><br />RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles .. slick worth a watch ..
1 This movie is outrageous , funny , ribald , sophisticated & hits the bullseye where 99 % of Hollywood movies do n't even make the target . Paul Bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era . He 's the American Renoir & Bunuel _ combined ! ! ! Glad I have the videodisc .
1 Saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since . What a wonderful group of actors ( I always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film ) . Really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a hoot . The script is smart , sly and tongue - in - cheek , poking fun at almost everything " Beverley Hills " . Loved Paul Bartel 's " doctor " and Ray Sharkey 's manservant . This was raunchy and crude , but thank god ! Unless you 're a prude , I heartily recommend this movie . FYI for anyone who likes to play six degrees of Kevin Bacon , Mary Woronov & Paul Bartel were in " Rock & Roll High School " . Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were in " Night of the Comet " together . They were all three in " Eating Raoul " .
1 Often laugh out loud funny play on sex , family , and the classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it 's seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett . Plot centers on two chauffers who 've bet on which one of them can bed his employer ( both single or soon to be single ladies , quite sexy -- Bisset and Woronov ) first . If Manuel wins , his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses , he must play bottom man to his friend ! < br /><br />Lots of raunchy dialogue , fairly sick physical humour , etc . But a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface . Bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy , teenaged niece on a year long " missionary trip " to Africa.<br /><br />Hilarious fun .
1 One of the unsung gems of the 1980 's , Scenes ... features razor - sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker ( how did she not get a ton of roles after this?)and Wallace Shawn . It 's a delicious send - up of class warfare and the people in those classes . The writing is hilarious and the characters , while not subtle , are nuanced . And , sorry , but the Asian gangs ( if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a " gang " ) were not put in for " sociological value " as another review implies they should been . The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it . I found it creative , funny , and idiosyncratic .
1 A long time ago , I watched this movie from the middle on cable . I then had a crush on Mary Moronov . I saw her again in Eating Raoul . I was convinced that she 's the hottest woman on screen.<br /><br />I maybe biased about this movie . 9 out of 10.<br /><br />This 's the only movie I own on original tape .
1 It was in 1988 , when I saw " The Ronnie and Nancy Show " for the first time ( on Austrian television ) . At that time , I was already a very big fan of Spitting Image ( since when it won the bronze rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986 ) . Of course I recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially " The Ronnie and Nancy Show " . I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of a painting of Abraham Lincoln ( thinking it was a mirror ) and said to himself " I need a shave " . Or most amusing of all , when he played ball with his dog - but vice - versa!<br /><br />It 's such a shame , that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion ; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made TV - shows ever . Compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all . < br /><br />Well , almost 20 years have passed since then , and I wish I could see the show again . Is it possible to purchase it from someone ... somewhere ?
1 I was pretty young when this came out in the US , but I recorded it from TV and watched it over and over again until I had the whole thing memorized . To this day I still catch myself quoting it . The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters , from Frank Sinatra , to Sylvester Stallone , to Mr. T. The voices were great , and sounded just like the characters they were portraying . The puppets were also well done , although a little creepy . I was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf , a show that I also enjoy very much . Like another person had written in a comment earlier , I too was robbed of this great show by a " friend " who borrowed it and never returned it . I sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release , but I do n't think enough people have heard of it . Oh well , maybe I 'll try e - bay ...
1 I used to love watching this . I had no idea it was part of a larger series . I must have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV . I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination for something that was clear that was in the president 's pile of bathtub toys . My parents had taped this off of TV when it originally aired on NBC . The tape even had the old Sanka coffee commercial along with a few others . I 'm planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so . If anyone of you would like to contact me , I think you can do that through the IMDb site feel free . I will keep you updated and let you know when I have the show in a digital format .
1 Master cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family . In this film too we see Resnais ' family members like Pierre Arditi , Sabine Azema , André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant dealing with serious themes like death , religion , suicide , love and their overall implications on our daily lives . The formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends , they address each other using a formal you . In 1984,while making L'amour à mort , Resnais dealt with time , memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence : Is love stronger than death ? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a somewhat similar film Je t'aime Je t'aime which was also about love and memories . Message of this film is loud and clear : true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation . L'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic . It is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images . This is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped .
1 Alain Resnais films are uncanny in the way that they are n't really edited for continuity , but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited . Love unto Death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie , and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps creates a new relationship , that of Agape / Thanatos.<br /><br />The beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie . A woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed -- did she kill him , or what happened ? Soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead , but from there a newer , stranger drama begins : the man wakes up , and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences . Meanwhile , their friends , who are both priests , watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love , faith , and devotion.<br /><br />Resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work , and what 's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work . In this case , Resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score , which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story . Trapped in this elegiac aside periodically , the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem , and I got strange flashbacks to Dante 's Divine Comedy from this one , despite the lack of direct reference within the movie . Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer , which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections . Memory - narrative , Resnais creates.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
1 Perfect cast for a few - person drama . Simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside . What he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by German avant - garde composer Werner Henze . Simon is haunted by his death , comforted by support of death people he 'd seen on the other side . His girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to , decides to follow him after his finally occurring death . Very touchy and moving , deeply psychological , but a bit slow and somewhere even boring .
1 A very high - standard Columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long - running series but was originally transmitted second ( after " Murder By The Book").<br /><br />Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency , who blackmails the wife ( Patricia Crowley ) of a rich , highly influential businessman ( played very sympathetically by Ray Milland ) after he falsifies a report , in her favour , after it is discovered she was having an affair . The wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .... <br /><br />A very satisfying episode in many respects , particularly as the plot is so strongly set - up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare Columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing . The whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist Columbo in his investigations : a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes , particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and Columbo 's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence.<br /><br />Directed with flair by Bernard L. Kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level , this really set the tone for whole series ( since " Murder By the Book " was let down by a poor ending ) . The script by Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link is precise , well - structured and well - thought - out and is underpinned by a steady , productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story . Ultimately , the finale fittingly epitomises that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer.<br /><br />Overall , this is a very fine piece of detective work for Columbo , and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished Columbo story .
1 This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series , and it holds up well today . As I am able to look at it closely now on DVD and see how it is constructed , I am very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski ( who directed the fine MACHO CALLAHAN as well as countless TV episodes)--watch how the post - murder actions of the killer are shown on a split - screen effect on his two eyeglasses , watch how the murder itself is shown in montage fashion , watch the point - of - view shot from the perspective of the corpse . Also , the wild but impressive avant - garde musical score from noted jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere . And the supporting performance of Brett Halsey as the golf pro was wonderful -- such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one - dimensional cutout . The " formula " had not yet been set when this episode was filmed , so there are still some surprises in Columbo 's methods . Of course , Falk , Robert Culp , and Ray Milland are the highest - quality actors and it 's a pleasure to see them work -- all men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here . In all , this entry in the Columbo series -- and MANY of the others -- are as well - crafted as a very good feature film .
1 The second official episode of the " Columbo " series ( " Murder by the Book , " filmed later , hit the airwaves first ) . Robert Culp , who would match wits with Peter Falk 's detective in several future installments , is terrific as the short - tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a client 's wife when she refuses to cave - in to his blackmail schemes . The two stars are well - matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series .
1 This was the first regular filmed Columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second , after Steven Spielberg 's " Columbo : Murder by the Book " . It 's also at the same time among one of the better ones!<br /><br />Bernard L. Kowalski was one great creative director ! No wonder that they later asked him to direct three more Columbo movies . The movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style , passion and eye for detail . Every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for TV movie . It 's definitely one of the better directed Columbo movies.<br /><br />It 's a quit original Columbo entry for a couple of reasons . The murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act . So the killer this time does n't have any time to plan out the ' perfect murder ' in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body . The killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out Lieutenant Columbo to solve the murder . It makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way Columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that . Of course Columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killer 's trust . This is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every Columbo movie gets set - up . I liked the story of the movie and how it progressed.<br /><br />It also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast . At the time of this movie Peter Falk had really made the Columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed . Robert Culp is truly great as the short tempered Brimmer . Funny thing is that he would later star in three different Columbo movies again and one " Mrs. Columbo " episode , only in totally different roles . He even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again . He by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later Columbo movies . Also the great Ray Milland makes an appearance in this movie , as the husband of the victim.<br /><br />All in all , a real great early Columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of movies.<br /><br />9/10
1 This is one of the first and best Columbos , starring Robert Culp and Ray Milland . Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo , as did several other villains , including Patrick McGoohan , William Shatner , and Jack Cassidy . Ray Milland also made a later appearance.<br /><br />In this one , Ray Milland is convinced his beautiful wife , played by Patricia Crowley , is having an affair , so he hires Culp to investigate . Culp has a blackmailing business on the side , so he gives Milland a fake report and threatens Crowley with the real one if she does n't pay up . They get into a huge fight in Culp 's home , and she winds up murdered . Enter Columbo.<br /><br />Culp does everything he can to get Columbo off the case , including offering him a job , but Columbo is on to him from the beginning.<br /><br />Excellent episode .
1 " Death Lends A Hand " is one of the pivotal early episodes of " Columbo " that helped define the show for the next thirty years . It marks the first of Robert Culp 's four appearances ( three as a murderer ) , playing much the same role in each show.<br /><br />In this case Culp plays Brimmer , the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate , Mr Kennicut , is having an affair . Although she is , Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut , in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband 's business associates . She reacts badly to this suggestion , an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as Brimmer whacks her across the face . Because he is wearing a large ring , the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her.<br /><br />There are some really priceless moments in this episode . One of my favourite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be into palm - reading , although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of Brimmer 's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring . Columbo being Columbo , he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little . So initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple - minded man who gets excited by the " lifeline going over the mound of the moon " , or some equally ridiculous palm - reading mumbo - jumbo.<br /><br />Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his firm , effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around . Again , Columbo does n't reveal that he knows what 's going on , he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer.<br /><br />And there 's another where Columbo says to Kennicut , in front of Brimmer , that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation . He wants to hint to Brimmer that he is onto him , without directly accusing him , so he rather cruelly ( but understandable in the circumstances ) decides to play mindgames on Brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid . Which of course he does ! All the while , the grieving Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation . It 's only near the end that Columbo explains all to Kennicut ( not shown on screen).<br /><br />I wo n't reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights , but let 's just say there 's a potato involved ... < br /><br />A really really good episode , possibly the very best of the first series . If you liked this then you 'll like " Double Exposure " too , also featuring Robert Culp .
1 I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode . Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring Columbo to me . After a few times , I get bored and changed the channel . I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others . First , Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland 's character . He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair . In return , Culp 's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career . Out of anger , Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere . I do n't know . Maybe I just did n't care for this one at all . Of course , Columbo gets him in the end . It 's just the question of how .
1 This cartoon is short on plot , but is a visually stunning piece of work . There will be very , very minor spoilers : < br /><br />This short has a " story " that 's incredibly slight - gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year , yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw . Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs . That 's pretty much the plot , such as it is . But this cartoon is n't about the plot - it 's about the color and animation . The visuals are exceptional . Back in 1936 , such bright color was still something of a novelty and there 's some incredibly inspired work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes . At more than one point , there are a series of pipes aligned in a row , from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed . These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for , but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM , because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing . It 's available on the DVD Attack of the ' 30s Characters . Recommended , particularly if you like good animation .
1 Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market . This market is essentially dominated by the Looney Tunes and the Merry Melodies shorts , coming from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able of releasing hidden gems , like " To Spring " , an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year.<br /><br />In the environment depicted here , spring is n't caused by natural cycles , but is fabricated . And by who ? By little male elves who live below ground . Each spring , when the snow begins to melt , they start working . They begin by felling rainbow rock columns , then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids , which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass , flowers ... In other words , spring ! The first half of the cartoon depicts spring 's fabrication , but the second part is a little bit different . Old Man Winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves ' work . So from this point , we assist to a battle between the elves and Old Man Winter.<br /><br />The music heard here is deliciously wonderful . The melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet . The second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action . This is just fantastico , Giorgio ! The animation sequences are also a delight . The colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive , epic environment . The concept itself is brilliant . The elves are attracting characters , so is Old Man Winter , who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season.<br /><br />There 's also a strong message included here . The battle seems lost for the elves at the end , until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves ' victory over winter . So the point is : only one single person can make the difference.<br /><br />In conclusion , " To Spring " is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era . What is even more remarkable is that this cartoon 's director made his debut here . And who is " To Spring " 's director ? It 's a certain William Hanna ...
1 If you are a fan , then you will probably enjoy this . If you do n't know who Misty Mundae , Darian Caine , Ruby LaRocca , or Seduction Cinema are , this is not the movie to start out with . It 's very cute , silly , the girls are hot , and it 's fun to watch . There 's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film , but the score is cheesy - trippy and the plot 's not a total bore . Misty Mundae 's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids , so she 's not as hot in this as she has been in others . But her panties in this are quite cute ( you 'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird ) . If you do like this one , you will probably enjoy " That 70 's Girl " , " Vampire Vixens " , or " Erotic Survivor " ( which is a bit more sexually graphic ) . If you prefer watching Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual , more horror / exploitation - based ( but lower budget ) movies , check out the Factory 2000 website .
1 Butch the peacemaker ? Evidently . After the violent beginning with Spike , Tom and Jerry all swinging away at each other , Butch calls a halt and wants to know why . It 's a good question.<br /><br />"Cats can get along with dogs , ca n't they ? " he asks Tom , who nods his head in agreement . " Mice can get along with cats , right ? " Jerry nods " no , " and then sees that is n't the right answer.<br /><br />They go inside and Butch draws up a " Peace Treaty " ( complete with professional artwork ! ) . Most of the rest , and the bulk of the cartoon , is the three of them being extremely nice to one another What a refreshing change - of - pace . I found it fun to watch . I can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head.<br /><br />Anyway , you knew the peace was n't going to last . A big piece of steak spells the death of the " peace treaty " but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual Tom & Jerry clever humor .
1 This film seems to be well remembered as the time Tom & Jerry signed a peace treaty . Things are idyllic for a time but , predictably , it goes sour . Probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe , a frying pan , and a baseball bat that the two plus Butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short . I enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network .
1 Tom the cat , Jerry the mouse , and Spike the Dog ( here called Butch , his third name , his second being ' Killer ' ) decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other . It 's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend 's seem to think so too . But by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak , everything is back to normal and all is how it should be . This short is the second one of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no clue why this one was . This cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry " < br /><br />My Grade : B
1 Without being one of my favorites , this is good for being a change of pace ... even if only for a few minutes.<br /><br />It all starts with a big fight between Tom , Jerry and Spike ( who is renamed " Butch " here ) . They 're all beating each other , but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision : he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends . So , all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends ... which is n't going to last for long.<br /><br />Meanwhile , the three become affectionate , patient and kind to each other . They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life . The relationship goes nothing but excellent , until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy . The three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries.<br /><br />But still ... to see Tom , Jerry and Spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience , even if only for a while.<br /><br />Oh , by the way , as a curious fact , two songs from " The Wizard of Oz " are played here in instrumental versions : " We 're off to see the Wizard " and " Somewhere over the rainbow " .
1 Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short - a situation is designed , conflict arises and mayhem ensues . The characters behave in appropriate ways , the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos . The best ( and funniest ) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected - all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes . A word of warning - it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine ! Highly recommended .
1 WWE has produced some of the worst pay - per - views in its history over the past few months . Cyber Sunday , Survivor Series and December to Dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its B brand show , Smackdown ! to attempt to end the year on a high note . Armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the Last Ride and Inferno matches , three Championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring Batista and John Cena against King Booker and Finlay . However , it was an amendment to one of those Championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when Teddy Long gave us fans an early Christmas present . T - Lo changed the WWE Tag Team Championship match from Champions , London and Kendrick against to Regal and Taylor to a four team Ladder match including MNM and The Hardy Boyz.<br /><br />I am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing I can say would be able to do it justice . This has to be seen to be believed . There were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings . The one move I have to talk about however was the one that took Joey Mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest . Jeff Hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with Matt Hardy holding both members of MNM over the opposite end of it to take the full force . Unfortunately for Mercury he did n't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye . This was vicious . His face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended Mercury 's night early . We found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye . Be warned . This is not for the faint of heart . The ending to this roller - coaster of a match came after Paul London managed to grab both Championship belts for the victory . I have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it does n't get any better than this match . Unbelievable.<br /><br />The night opened with only the 4th ever Inferno match . Kane took on MVP in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action . There were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was Kane who forced MVP onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring . MVP ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this . May I suggest to Michael Hayes that MVP comes out next week on Smackdown ! to Johnny Cash 's Ring of Fire.<br /><br />The other gimmick match of the night , and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war Last Ride match between Mr Kennedy and The Undertaker . This was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series Undertaker and Kennedy have had yet . The used poles , chairs and one scene had The Undertaker thrown 15 feet from the Armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor . Unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd did n't pop for this . The ending came after a chokeslam by The Dead Man to Kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match - winning tombstone.<br /><br />In other notable happening from the card . Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero by submission in another stiff match . This was a very good bout with Benoit hitting 8 German suplexes on Chavo at one time . Benoit was also considering whether to put Vikki Guerrero in the sharpshooter or not . Luckily he came to his senses and let her go . This led to Chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission.<br /><br />Another cracking match on the card was the Cruiserweight Championship contest between the longest reigning Champion in WWE , Gregory Helms and Jimmy Wang Yang . Featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots , some of which took place outside the ring , this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got . JBL put it best when he berated the fans in Richmond , Virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant . Helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to Smackdowns ! resident redneck.<br /><br />The Boogeyman pinned The Miz in a worthless match . I hate The Boogeyman with a passion . Only worth listening too for JBL 's ranting about Miz . JBL is comedy gold.<br /><br />The last match of the night was main event number 3 . World Heavyweight Champion , Batista and WWE Champion , John Cena teamed up to take on Finlay and the Champion of Champions , King Booker . There was no way the match could top the Tag Team Championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less . The match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have I said that about WWE matches this year already . It was King Booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big Batistabomb.<br /><br />So 2006 is over for the WWE in regards to it 's pay - per - view schedule . It started the year on a terrible note with New Year 's Revolution but ended on a high one with Armageddon . This Ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time . My hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match .
1 WWE 's last PPV of 2006 , proved to be a hit with the fans , but for one reason only , the ladder match which was only scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor . But with the recent crap PPV being December to Dismember , WWE knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again , this proved useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match.<br /><br />The match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I have ever seen , but Joey Mercury 's face was a total mess . Johnny Nitro did n't even check on his partner , they just carried on like nothing happened , and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots . In the end London and Kendrick retained the titles.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the show Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match when he set MVP 's stupid costume on fire . Chris Benoit downed Chavo Guerrero in a decent match , Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a solid effort.<br /><br />But the main event was a total mess , King Booker teamed with Finlay to take on John Cena and Batista . The action was shoddy and no one cared who Batista picked for his partner.<br /><br />Overall Results : Kane defeated MVP in an inferno match.<br /><br />Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag team titles against The Hardy Boyz , MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match.<br /><br />Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match.<br /><br />Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship.<br /><br />The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible match.<br /><br />The Undertaker defeated Mr Kennedy in a last ride match.<br /><br />John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in an abysmal match.<br /><br />Overall Grade - B
1 Armageddon PPV < br /><br />The last PPV of 2006<br /><br />Smackdown brand.<br /><br />Match Results Ahead********<br /><br />We are starting the show with The Inferno match . Kane v. MVP . This was an okay match . Nothing about wrestling here . This was about the visuals . Overall , this was not bad . There were a few close spots here with Kane getting too close to the fire , but in the end , Kane won with ramming MVP into the fire back first.<br /><br />Nice opener . Let 's continue.<br /><br />Teddy Long announces a new match for the tag team titles : London and Kendrick will defend against : Regal and Taylor , The Hardyz , and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH ! ! ! ! Let 's get moving!<br /><br />Match two : Fatal four way ladder match . This was total carnage . Judging by three out of the four teams here , you would expect chaos . The spots were amazing . A total spot - fest . One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder ! Shortly afterword , Jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as MNM were going to kill Jeff , Matt makes the save and Jeff hits the " see - saw " shot to Joey Mercury ! Mercury is hurt . His eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way . Mercury is taken out of the match and Nitro is still there . He is going to fight alone for the titles ! Regal and Taylor then grab London and suplex him face - first into the ladder ! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot , dropkicks through the ladder to nail Jeff ! Awesome ! In the end , London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles . What a match!!!<br /><br />This was insane . I ca n't figure out why WWE did not announce this till now . The Buyrate would increase huge . I 'm sure the replay value will be good though.<br /><br />Mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye . He is at the hospital now . Get well kid.<br /><br />No way anything else here will top that.<br /><br />Next up : The Miz v. Boogeyman.(Ugh ) This was a nothing match . Will the Boogeyman ever wrestle ? The Miz sucks too . After a insane crowd , this kills them dead . DUD.<br /><br />Chris Benoit v. Chavo . This was a strong match . I enjoyed it . Chavo hit a killer superplex at one point ! Benoit hit EIGHT German suplexes too ! Benoit wins with the sharpshooter . Good stuff.<br /><br />Helms v. Yang - Cruiserweight title championship match . This was a good match . Unfortunately , the stupid fans did not care for this . WHY ? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestled well . I agree with JBL . He ranted to the crowd . JBL is 100 % correct . Learn to appreciate this or get out . < br /><br />Mr . Kennedy v. The Undertaker - Last Ride match . Not too much here . This was a slug fest , with a few exceptions . Kennedy at one point tossed Taker off the top of the stage to the floor . The spot was fine . Reaction was disappointing . The end spot was Taker tomb - stoned Kennedy on the hearse and won the match . Unreal . Kennedy needed this win . They both worker hard . Still , Kennedy needed this win . Undertaker should have lost . Creative screwed up again.<br /><br />A stupid diva thing is next . I like women . Not this . At least Torrie was not here . That 's refreshing . Judging from the crowd , Layla should have won . The WWE wanted Ashley . Consider this your bathroom break . Next.<br /><br />Main Event : Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a nothing match . The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker . Batista and Booker ca n't work well together . Finlay tries to make Cena look good . The finish was botched . Finlay hit Batista 's knee with a chair shot and Batista no - sold the shot and finished the match . Lame . Not main event caliber at all.<br /><br />Overall , Armageddon would have scored less , but the ladder match WAS the main event here . That was enough money 's worth right there . A few others were solid . < br /><br />The Last Word : A good PPV with the ladder match being the savior . Smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough . Smackdown needs to stop letting Cena tag along . Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs . This show proves that Smackdown can .
1 WWE Armageddon , December 17 , 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum , Richmond , VA < br /><br />Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno match : So this is the fourth ever inferno match in the WWE and it is Kane vs. MVP ( wonder why was it the first match on the card ) . I only viewed the ending parts where Kane sets MVP 's ass on fire as they 're on the apron and then MVP is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as MVP sprawls around the entrance ramp . Funny and visually quite entertaining ending . 7/10<br /><br />WWE Tag Team Championship : This was originally supposed to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London ( c ) in a regular tag team match . However , GM Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that it 's going to be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match . MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it 's all chaos . One word to describe this eye - opener  wow . Man , I really ca n't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words ca n't really do it justice . There was one particularly notable spot where The Hardys set up a ladder in a see - saw position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM for the kill , and then WHAM ! Nitro blew away while Mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face . He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match alone . Another spot was when Jeff powerbombed London while FLIPPING off the ladder . There were other high - flying breathtaking spots too many to remember . London finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show - stealer . 8.5/10<br /><br />The Boogeyman vs. The Miz : The two men get thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit - out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over The Miz 's mouth as usual . 5.5/10 for this three - minute incognito.<br /><br />United States championship : Chris Benoit ( c ) faces off Chavo Guerrero in yet another typical Guerrero match . Some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by Chavo and an unusually long chain of German suplexes by Benoit . Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail Benoit but Benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a Sharpshooter or not . This allows Chavo to go for a roll - up but Benoit rolls it up once more and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter . Game over . Nice hard - fought battle albeit slow at times . 7/10<br /><br />WWE Cruiserweight championship : Gregory Helms ( c ) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this one , in a fairly moderate - paced match . The match had some good high - flying spots  most notably Helms ' moves off the top rope  but the crowd did n't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match , and Yang needs to get more airborne . Helms won the match after blowing Yang away with a facebuster on the knee . 7.5/10<br /><br />The Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match : After a series of matches between these two , this time it is a Last Ride match , the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse . Pretty good indeed for what these two could offer . Kennedy manhandled a good deal of Taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw Taker off the Armageddon set about 15 feet below ; and thank God for Kennedy , otherwise it would 've been brutal . Kennedy almost got the win until Taker got back up inside the hearse ( I liked the camera view inside the hearse ) . Taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on Kennedy and broke the hearse 's window instead , but then later busted Kennedy open with a chair , and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and Tombstone on the hearse 's roof . Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win . I actually found myself really interested into these guys ' willingness to take / give real sick shots . 7.5/10<br /><br />Santa comes into the ring , I go " what the hell ? " like many of the kids in the crowd , and then the word " lingerie contest " gets in my ear . Break time.<br /><br />Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker : talk about charisma vs. technicality . This match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense . Even Finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time ( I kind of doubted his strength against the champs ) , and him and Booker mainly did n't succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where Booker rammed his scepter into Cena 's throat . Batista hits the Bomb on Booker for the win , did n't get to see the F - U ; Cena performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyhow and I think he also did the STFU . This was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7.5/10.<br /><br />Being an on - and - off WWE fan , I have to agree that Armageddon was laced up with numerous eye - catchers throughout , and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show ; the Last Ride match featured some fairly nerve - wrenching spots , and the main event also did very well for its category . All other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the Boogeyman vs. The Miz bout and the ever - useless lingerie contest . Overall Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay - per - view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology , Armageddon wishes this year 's goodbye respectably . PPV rating : 8/10 .
1 If , unlike some of the commenters here , you are not staging a class war and do n't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful , extroverted , bohemian ( gasp ) and not being terribly English at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film , closer to Euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick American crap ... I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making , I 'd defend this , the film is n't any worse as a result , and it puts the spotlight on the cast , some of whom are really good ( Kate Hardie- think that 's her name , as the sarcastic drunk is spot - on ) the one exception being David Baddiel , who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff ! ! It 's light , and we do n't go for this kind of anatomising - of - relationship crap in this country , but if you do n't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this .
1 I had never heard of Leos Carax until his Merde segment in last years Tokyo , and his was easily the stand - out the film 's three stories . It was n't my favorite of the shorts , but it was the most unique , and the most iconic . " The Lovers on the Bridge " was the first of his full length features I 've seen , a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic . Though he 's classified as a neo - nouvelle vogue , his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60 's experimental narratives . His movies are closer to Jean Vigo in " L'atlante " , Jean Cocteau , and Guy Maddin , than Godard and Truffaut.<br /><br />In Boy Meets Girl Carax 's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states . He combines the exaggerated worlds of Maddin , but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like Cocteau , but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible , emotional , and engaging like Vigo 's movies.<br /><br />The story of Boy Meets Girl is simple , and similar to Carax 's two following films which comprise this " Young lovers " trilogy . A boy named Alex played by Denis Lavant ( who plays a character named Alex in Carax 's next two movies ) , has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend . In the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder . He walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex , and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate . He steals records for her and leaves them at his friend 's apartment , but avoids contacting either of them directly . He wanders around and finds his way to a party , where he meets a suicidal young woman , and the film becomes part " Breathless " and part " Limelight".<br /><br />Later he is advised by an old man with sign language to " speak up for yourself ... young people today It 's like they forgot how to talk . " The old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film , and how an actor timid off stage became a confident " lion " when in front of the camera . Heres where the movie tips its hand , but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene , since it overlaps the style of the film ( silent and expressionist ) , with the content ( a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to ) . Though Alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end , he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which are n't easy to nail down from moment to moment , aside from a desire to fall in love.<br /><br />There is a scene in the film where Alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies , all crying in a chorus that fills that room , until he turns on a tape of a children 's show making them fall silent . Unexpectedly due a glitch the TV ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses . Even as Carax is self - reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell ( the room full of whining infants ) , he 's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses . Even the rich old , bell of the ball has a brother she misses . In another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence.<br /><br />Though indebted to films before talkies , Carax is a master of music , knowing when to pipe in the Dead Kennedy 's " Holiday in Cambodia " , or an early David Bowie song , the sounds of a man playing piano , or of a girl softly humming.<br /><br />In Boy Meets Girl , when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt , when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel , when Alex enters a party an feels out of place , its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance ; like the famous author who ca n't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain , or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut . This film is the missing link between Jean Piere Jenuet , Michel Gondry , and Wes Anderson , whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy , all have a parallel with different visuals , musical , and emotional cues in these Carax movies.<br /><br />Every line of dialog , every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level , some I lack words to articulate . There are many tales of a boy meeting a girl , but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment . The other movies you want to watch can wait . See this first . If I were to make films , I would want them to be like this , in fact I wish all films were like this , where the ephemeral becomes larger than life , and life itself becomes a dream .
1 Although I 'm grateful this obscure gem of 70 's Italian exploitation cinema features in the recently released " Grindhouse Experience " box set , and although it 's also available on disc under the misleading and stupid alternate title " Escape from Death Row " , I honestly think it deserves a proper and luxurious DVD edition , completely in its originally spoken languages with subtitle options ( the dubbing is truly horrible ) , restored picture quality and a truckload of special bonus features ! Heck , I do n't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film in its original language . " Mean Frank and Crazy Tony " is a cheerfully fast - paced mafia / crime flick with a lot of violence , comedy ( which , admittedly , does n't always work ) , feminine beauty and two witty main characters . Tony Lo Bianco is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city 's biggest Don . When the real crime lord Frankie Dio ( Lee Van Cleef ) arrives in town , he sees an opportunity to climb up the ladder by offering his services . Frankie initially ignores the little crook , but they do eventually form an unlikely team when Frankie 's entire criminal empire turns against him and a new French criminal mastermind even assassinates Frankie 's innocent brother . Tony helps Frankie to escape from prison and together they head for Marseille to extract Frankie 's revenge . The script of this sadly neglected crime gem funnily alters gritty action & suspense with light - headed bits of comedy , like the grotesque car chase through the narrow French mountain roads for example . The build up towards the typical mafia execution sequences ( guided by an excellent Riz Ortolani score ) are extremely tense and the actual killings are sadistic and merciless , which is probably why the film is considered to be somewhat of a grindhouse classic . The film lacks a strong female lead , as the lovely and amazingly voluptuous beauty Edwige Fenech sadly just appears in a couple of scenes , and then still in the background . On of the men behind the camera , responsible for the superb cinematography , was no less then Joe D'Amato . Great film , highly recommended to fans of Italian exploitation , and I hope to watch it again soon in its original version .
1 Frankie Dio ( Lee VanCleef ) is a high - ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling ( for reasons that seem unclear to me ) . Tony ( Tony Lo Bianco ) is a low - level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying Frankie . By being in the right place at the right time , Tony gets arrested with Frankie and is sent to jail ... where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship , but it will do for now.<br /><br />This film came to me under the title of " Frank and Tony " , which is disappointing because I see an alternate name is " Mean Frank and Crazy Tony " , which would have helped sell the film more effectively . I presume that 's an homage to " Dirty Mary , Crazy Larry " but what do I know ? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film , " Violent Professionals " , and I must say the two complement each other very well.<br /><br />Italians have always lagged behind Americans in their budgets and production values , which is a real shame with this film . It is considered a " grindhouse " film , which unfairly demotes it to a b - movie ( or worse ) . With a cleaner sound and picture , this could have been a Hollywood hit , I suspect . I found the story very interesting , the characters ( and actors ) better than average and unlike " Violent Professionals " the plot is fairly clear -- not too many secondary characters.<br /><br />If you like Mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try . A film about the mob that 's actually from Italy ( how much more authentic do you want ? ) is as much as you can ask . Sure , it 's not " The Godfather " , but it 's not supposed to be . This is n't a drama , it 's a light comedy , heavy action buddy film ... like " Die Hard With a Vengeance " from the point of view of the bad guys . Well , okay , not really.<br /><br />If nothing else , this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast . Films besides " Escape From New York " ( where VanCleef plays " Hauk " ) and the usual cult movies . What 's more fun than discovering a lost classic ?
1 I scooped up this title by accident with the Grindhouse Vol . 1 collection of pure Euro - trash movies . But this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there . Stupednous it is not ... satisfying it is ! Watching this movie I could n't help to wonder ... how come Sergio Martino did n't make this flick ? This has his signature all over it and punctuated by Edwedge Fenech ( alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in Hostel II ) . Double - crosses and triple - crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second . Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through ? Besides Lee 's more recognizable films , film - goers should try this on for size and see how if Sergio Leone would 've lowered his epic scale down on Once Upon a Time in America to half the running time ( and 1/4 of the budget ) this is what it would 've turned out to be like . So refreshing , it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinée
1 Steely , powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede ( the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form ) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection . Fawning goofball small - time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda ( an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco ) gets busted as well . Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars . Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata ( smoothly played by Jean Rochefort ) . Director Michele Lupo , working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni , relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace , sustains a suitably gritty , but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout , and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip - snorting brio ( a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights ) . Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice , loose and engaging on - screen chemistry ; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching . The ravishing Edwige Fenech alas is n't given much to do as Tony 's whiny girlfriend Orchidea , but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much - appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene . Riz Ortolani 's groovy , pulsating , syncopated funk / jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin ' spot . The polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive . A really nifty and entertaining little winner .
1 " Rich in Love " is a slice - of - life film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky Charleston , SC family . Highly romanticized , beautifully shot , well written and acted , " RIL " washes over you like a summer breeze as its plotless meandering breathes life into the characters such that at film 's end you 'll feel like an old friend of the family.<br /><br />A wonderfully crafted character - driven film from the director of " Driving Miss Daisy " , " RIL " is a somewhat obscure little " sleeper " which will appeal most to mature audiences .
1 I liked this a lot . In fact , if I see it again(and I plan to ) I just may love it . I 'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch . It starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it . You just get into it.<br /><br />I really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole . The characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take . < br /><br />I am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this - there are obscure TV movies that have more comments then Rich In Love.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending which is driving me crazy and I HAVE to watch it again to see that . This is a movie that may not be for everybody but that I feel is strongly underrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is have n't seen this ) and it does n't even seem to have much of a message board but I liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery , atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this . Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina so for those ( like me ) who love the south , and movies that take place there , this is a gem . I 'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick .
1 I have enjoyed Criminal Intent series of Law and Order for a long time . Kathryn Erbe , Det . Alexandra Eames , the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent Series . See her other side in this movie.<br /><br />This movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a Criminal Intent fan this movie is a revelry in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardships in the South.<br /><br />I did not like Albert Finneys role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older Southern fellow that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change . He reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine , but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie.<br /><br />Katryn Erbe is easy to like in this movie and why I recommend it as a 10 star for Criminal Intent , law and order fans .
1 This is a racist movie , but worthy of study and enjoyment . First time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad . They have a relaxed , peaceful thing going , what with her still at home about to graduate from high school , and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something . Second time through you realize how horribly the sister 's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar . He takes it , it 's the thing to do these days , and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather . In that same scene the sister 's blues song is a real tear - jerker if you 're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music . Her performance feels like the climax of the story ; a blues story with the good guys being " people of color " in their element in backwoods , SC . Meanwhile , all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies . That 's cool , long as you recognize it as fiction .
1 In a way , this film reminded me of " Jumping Jack Flash " . Remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredding machine ? Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers ? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger ? Great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks , right ? That 's how I feel about " Rich In Love " . A man hears his wife sing for the first time . Post - coital teenagers talk about the nature of love . Albert Finney eats ice cream out of bucket and , in another scene , has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife . Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe . But there 's only the whisper of a plot here and you ca n't wait for it to Get Moving . Only when ex - Go - Gos ' Charlotte Caffey 's The Graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up ... and then it 's over!<br /><br />This picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer 's day in the deep American South .
1 It 's a road movie , with a killer on - board . Brian Kessler ( David Duchovny ) , a sophisticated , urbane writer , wants to conduct field research on American serial killers . But , neither he , nor his girlfriend , Carrie ( Michelle Forbes ) , has the money for a cross - country tour of murder sites , so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses . Who they end up with is a young couple , Early Grayce ( Brad Pitt ) and his girlfriend , Adele ( Juliette Lewis ) , two better examples of " poor white trash " you will never find in all of cinema.<br /><br />Indeed , Early and Adele are what make this film so entertaining , as they babble , cackle , confide , muse , speculate , drool , and otherwise behave in ways I have n't seen since reruns of " The Beverly Hillbillies " . Early 's idea of California : " People think faster out there , on account of all that warm weather ; cold weather makes people stupid " . That 's enough to convince Adele : " I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here " . To which Early responds proudly : " It sure does " . Early continues to instruct Adele about California : " You never have to buy no fruit , on account it 's all on the trees ... and they ai n't got no speed limits , and I hear your first month 's rent is free , state law".<br /><br />But poor Early has some , well , mental problems , which become ever more obvious to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the U.S. As they enter the desert Southwest , with its beautifully stark landscape , " Kalifornia " starts to look more and more like " The Hitcher " ( 1986 ) , and Early starts to act more and more like John Ryder , everyone 's maniacal hitchhiker , whose terror seemed so unstoppable.<br /><br />In " Kalifornia " , the acting is uneven . Duchovny 's performance is flat . Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective , despite his overacting at times . Michelle Forbes is great as the avant - garde , photographic artist . But my choice for best performance goes to Juliette Lewis . With her nasal voice and heavy - duty Southern accent , she is stunning , as the naive , highly animated , child - like Adele.<br /><br />Toward the end , the film takes on a Twilight Zone feel to it , as our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins . The plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence , an ending that was somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />Overall , however , " Kalifornia " is an entertaining film , thanks to a clever concept , great scenery , especially in the second half , good cinematography , great dialogue , and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis .
1 it 's amazing that so many people that i know have n't seen this little gem . everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction : WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!<br /><br />i've never much cared for Brad Pitt ( though his turns in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show improvement ) but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving , dark and right on target.<br /><br />everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie 's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings . the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening.<br /><br />the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book , is that compared to what came before it , the ending is a bit too long and overblown . but that 's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic.<br /><br />if you check this film out , try to get the letterboxed unrated director 's cut for the best viewing option.<br /><br />rating:9
1 In the same vein as Natural Born Killers , another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved , Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence , but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act . Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first , but shows the bad side by the end of the movie , which is far worse than the good side is good . David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler , an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend , who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for , I do n't know where , places where nudity passes for art . Maybe it really does and I just do n't understand it . At any rate , Brian and Carrie ( Duchovny and Michelle Forbes , who fits the role flawlessly ) , make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites . Brian , the writer , will write the book , Carrie can take the pictures.<br /><br />Being artistic types , Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip , so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses , and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners ( Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ) . Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer , sees the ad on a bulletin board , and decides to leave the state for a while , violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord 's murder so he wo n't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation . Two birds with one stone , you know.<br /><br />The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes , the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash , without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type . Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals , but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele , Brian is fascinated with Early 's status as an outlaw , as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early 's gun . Never having fired a gun before , he 's as fascinated as a little kid . While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early " broke her " of smoking and that she 's not allowed to drink ( Early does n't think women should ) , Early and Brian are out at the local bar . Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him , and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy . " Hit him , Bri , it 's comin ' . " This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie , partly because it 's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy 's friends drag him away , bloodied and battered , but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel , we learn so much all at once about the two couples , their differences , and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them . And besides that , because Brian benefited from Early 's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele , it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.<br /><br />Clearly , by now , you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller , where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues . On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer , but on the other hand it 's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross - country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes . While studying the actions of past murderers , Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying , and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it 's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.<br /><br />I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt 's versatility as an actor . Consider , for example , his roles in movies like Kalifornia , 12 Monkeys , Fight Club , and Ocean 's 11 and 12 . Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character , and is completely believable . Incidentally , I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year , but just could n't get the hair and beard right . I even got the hat right , which initially I thought would be the hardest part.<br /><br />It 's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder , but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience 's understanding of its subject matter . A film that did n't glorify violence , at least initially , could never be as effective as Kalifornia , but the movie structures it perfectly . The glorification is all embodied in Brian 's and Carrie 's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened , but their realization , and ours , is embodied in the real thing , which they encounter with Early and Adele . The movie 's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real .
1 " Kalifornia " is one of my all - time favourite movies , and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s . The film has a very stylish surface to it , but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others . One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances , Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer - trash psycho named Early . Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly . Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend , her innocence is almost heart - breaking . " Kalifornia " has a very simple plot to it , that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour , but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder , as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality . There are alot of shocking scenes , and it all mounts to a power - house climax that will haunt you for days . " Kalifonia " is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be , and not only for it`s violence and gore .

1 I just got done watching " Kalifornia " on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it back in July of 2001 . You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films , that " Kalifornia " would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but has n't . Perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996 - 1999 , maybe it might have been more successful . In my opinion , " Kalifornia " is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s . It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today 's serial killer films like " Seven " or " The Bone Collector " . Many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them . " Kalifornia " is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind . It tries to answer questions like " why do they do the things they do ? Is it because of something that happened in their past ? Does it make them feel superior or powerful ? Or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill ? " These are some of the things that " Kalifornia " tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves . Brad Pitt makes an everlasting impression as Early Grayce . When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film , we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual . When we first see him , it 's late at night . Early is possibly drunk . We then see him pick up a rock , throw it off a bridge , and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car . Pitt is fierce in this film . It is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people . It 's funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in " 12 Monkeys " and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher 's " Seven " .
1 I had seen ' Kalifornia ' before ( must be about 10 years ago ) and I still remember to be very impressed by it . That 's why I wanted to see it again and all I can say is that it still has n't lost its power , even though I 'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that I was ten years ago.<br /><br />'Kalifornia ' tells the tale of the writer Brian Kessler and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin , a photographer , who want to move to California . But instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains , they choose to make a trip by car . He wants to write a book about America 's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures . But because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol , they decide to take another couple with them , so they can spread the costs of the trip . Only one couple has answered the add , so they will automatically be the lucky ones . But they have n't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time , when their trip has already started , Carrie is shocked . Without wanting to be prejudiced , she can only conclude that Early Grayce and Adele Corners are poor white trailer park trash . She definitely does n't want them in her car , but Brian does n't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway . At first the couple does n't seem to be that bad after all , but gradually Early Grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer ... <br /><br />Not only is the story very impressive , so is the acting from our four leads . Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Grayce . His performance in this movie may well be his best ever . The same for Juliette Lewis . She plays the childish and naive girlfriend that does n't want to hear a bad word about her Early and does that really very well . But David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are a surprise as well . They both did a very good job and I really wonder why we never heard anything from Forbes again since this movie , because she really proves to have a lot of talent.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story , but because of the graphic violence , I can imagine that it may not be to everybody 's taste ( although I do n't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way ) . Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me ( it 's a part of the story that 's too important to be left out ) . I reward this movie with an 8/10 .
1 Kalifornia came out in 1993 , just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 . This is a nice psycho - thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work , like with most of his episodes of the X - Files , Playing God , and Red Shoe Diaries.<br /><br />People who were put off by the heavy southern accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south . For every " Brian and Carrie " in the south , there is an " Adele and Early " and in 2006 , that 's the real horror of this flick.<br /><br />Aside from that , I think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with Carrie 's photography , it 's not suitable for mass consumption . But if you have a copy of this in your personal library , I think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies .
1 Kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights . Ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post . Kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer . Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional . Check it out ! !
1 I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night . I do like Juliette Lewis although I 'm indifferent to Brad Pitt . After this viewing I have to admit he 's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable , and I did n't think " Brad Pitt " at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately I ca n't say the same for David Duchovny . I 'm an X - Files fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie , as I 'd thought it was made a few years later . I like Duchovny but found his character a little two - dimensional here , except where he 's doing voice - overs . That part was strong , seemed in character , good intonation , etc . Otherwise I kept thinking " Agent Mulder " , which is a pity.<br /><br />Michelle Forbes was a treat . Why have n't I noticed her before ? ( I 'll be looking up to see what other roles she 's done and seeing those asap ) I am slightly concerned about stereotyping re Lewis , this film , and " Natural Born Killers " ( a firm favourite ) . Interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she 's a willing accomplice , whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge Early 's dark side until it 's thrust in her face.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film almost unreservedly . Apart from Duchovny 's character not seeming fully - formed ( and perhaps being " washed out " somewhat by Pitt 's ) , it was perfect . I was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die , yet they had to suffer first . It was realistic , tense , disturbing.<br /><br />If you like NBK you may well like this movie , and vice - versa .
1 Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals . A journey on the darkest road ever . The road of no return . The plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in California . The man ( David Duchovny in his best role up to now ) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in America and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures . So they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way . To share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad . But the couple that answers it is not just ANY couple . It is one of the strangest couples ever . The girl is a naive , frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses . The man is exactly the opposite . A cruel ruthless murderer . We learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to Kalifornia ( not with C as usual , but with K , presumably symbolizing the word killer ) , along his journey of betrayal , murder and finally defeat . All the leads , Duchovny , Pitt , Lewis and Forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star . The photography is amazing , with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie , and the music suits the dark character of the film . On the whole this is a really good movie . Do n't miss it . You 'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with !
1 If this is supposed to be a portrayal of the American serial killer , it comes across as decidedly average.<br /><br />A journalist [ Duchovny ] travels across country to California to document America 's most famous murderers , unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [ Pitt ] is a serial killer himself.<br /><br />Rather predictable throughout , this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well , but I 'd not bother to see it again .
1 In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV Too Young To Die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in Kalifornia . I have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.<br /><br />Kalifornia finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend , art photographer Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to Duchovny 's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers . In fact he 's got a most unusual odyssey planned , he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers . But he and Forbes are flat broke.<br /><br />Fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip . It turns out Pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own , delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality.<br /><br />Kalifornia is not the type of film I usually go for , but in fact the acting ability and charisma of Brad Pitt make it work to a large degree . Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance . But better than he is is Juliette Lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well . Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life . Lewis 's dialog and Forbes 's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country.<br /><br />For those who like their slasher flicks , they do n't come better than Kalifornia .
1 I had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me . Alas , I have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by ' Kalifornia ' upon watching again recently . I am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago.<br /><br />There are two things which really give this movie its power . The first is its cast . We have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace . Knowing Pitt , as we all do , as one of the most enduring heart - throbs Hollywood has ever had , it is refreshing to see him play such a vile , unattractive character . Pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white - trash cliché or parody , and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie.<br /><br />Juliette Lewis is equally impressive as Grace 's tragic girlfriend , playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old 's life experience . Lewis manages to evoke pity ( for her character 's station in life ) as well as contempt ( for her naivety ) , but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young . Personally , I think it 's a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here.<br /><br />David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the US with Pitt and Lewis . Duchovony is aptly geeky and naive , and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut - off , but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters ' changes as they are equally intrigued , repulsed and strangely attracted to Pitt.<br /><br />The fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside , this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing . At the time ' Kalifornia ' was released , Hollywood was releasing a slew of nice - character - turns - out - to - be - psychotic movies ( ' Single White Female ' , ' Pacific Heights ' , ' The Hand That Rocks The Cradle ' , ' Deceived ' , ' Sleeping With The Enemy ' etc ) . Most of these movies followed the same formula , the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy . ' Kalifornia ' does n't really stray too far from this territory , but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow - boil thriller , and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn.<br /><br />When the penny does drop , and Pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy , the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes do n't quite live up to rest of the movie . That said , the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold . The fight is over , but the scars will always be there.<br /><br />Much of the narration ( provided by a somewhat whiny , pre X - files Duchovony ) is a tad contrived . Of course , it 's meant to be from the book the Duchovony 's journalist character has written , so one could argue that the self - conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.<br /><br />The film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90 % of the thrillers of the past twenty years . Highly recommended , but not for the weak of stomach or mind . This film is disturbing on more than one level . But then , it 's meant to be .
1 * * * * = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten < br /><br />***1/2 = A classic in time ; simply a must see < br /><br / > * * * = A solid , worth - while , very entertaining piece < br /><br />**1/2 = A good movie , but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws < br /><br / > * * = May still be considered good in areas , but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable ( e.g. , genre)<br /><br />*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments < br /><br />BOMB = Not of a viewable quality < br /><br />- Kalifornia = * * * < br /><br />- Unrated ( for strong violent material , considerable sexuality , and language)<br /><br />I rented this film expecting an in - your - face summer - Blockbuster - quality celebration of Brad Pitt 's face , but was happily surprised and disappointed . This really is more of a drama , and very grim at that ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voice - overs.<br /><br />Pitt plays out his possibly un - sexiest film ever with startling talent . Who started out as a hopeless yet harmless " white trash " husband became realized as a violent , disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind . During some of the latter stages in the film , I found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary . This proves very good writing and acting.<br /><br />The whole movie is filled with bizarre , sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once , and I do n't mean action scenes . I mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted I actually winced and gasped at what I was seeing . It was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death . Again , I am very impressed with the screenwriter(s ) ; whoever they are did the impossible : mixed oil and water.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed Juliette Lewis 's performance . It is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy . Some of her moments in this film brought me to tears . I mean that . The emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible , and I clearly remember getting blurry - eyed on a few occasions.<br /><br />I almost feel like I 'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving " KALIFORNIA " a * * * rating . But the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it . I do believe that everyone should see this movie though . I truly do .
1 This Was One Scary Movie.<br /><br />Brad Pitt Deserved an Oscar for this.<br /><br />A traveling novelist ( played by David Duchovny of the X - Files fame ) and his girlfriend pick up two hitch - hikers(Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt ) on their way to California . < br /><br />On their way they stop at infamous serial killer murder scenes to photography the scenes for an upcoming book Duchovny 's character is working on , little do they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to them in the same car .
1 A surprisingly effective thriller , this.<br /><br />David Duchovny and Michelle ' Ensign Ro ' Forbes are a successful , professional couple , he a writer , she a photographer . Forbes is desperate to move to California and , in an act of compromise , Mulder agrees to the move on the condition that , along the way , they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers . His idea : he writes the words , she takes the pictures , with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life . To help finance the trip , they decide to car share and advertise the fact . As their bad luck would have it Brad Pitt sees the advert and , shortly after killing his landlord , he and his girlfriend , Juliette Lewis , meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek . Inevitably , mischief ensues.<br /><br />Pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring Early Grayce and is capably backed up by Lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting . Duchovny and Forbes make for a convincing double act too and , as events spiral out of control , you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting.<br /><br />Intelligent , sinister and beautifully shot , this deserves recognition beyond its current status . A top movie .
1 I ca n't say too much about Kalifornia as sadly I have yet to actually see the whole thing ( I 've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on Fuse . ) But what I have seen is absolutely awesome ! I am a fan of Brad Pitt but I admit not all his earlier movies are well good . But this role , I just , his acting is great , his character Early seems so normal well okay creepy , dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type I guess . And Juliette Lewis 's performance although I can see how some may be annoyed by it I think it 's amazing . Sadly I have yet to see the end , but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good , but disappointing . I have to admit that I wish David Duchovany 's ( sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect ) was a bit flat but for him it was okay . His wife 's character was better , and I thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good , a portrait of the avant - Gard / older sister type . Particularly the scene where Early and Brian go to play pool , and Adele and Carrie are having their one on one time together . I 've watched that scene at least twice now and I still think the acting in it is just wonderful . One because of the emotion that Adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about Early and Carrie 's reaction to it . Everything about that I think is just so perfect . I mean , maybe it 's because I can relate a bit , I 'm not sure . < br /><br />As for Brad Pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once ; I thought he was great . Some movies with Pitt that I 've seen were just average or not worth seeing . I do n't think I 've ever seen a terrible Pitt movie or if I have it 's not because of his acting it 's other factors . This movie was not one of them . He turned out a great performance in Kalifornia . I swear I 'm not just some random I do like him for his acting not just because he 's good looking , I mean his character in this movie is n't exactly handsome or cute by any means ! Pitt is dark , brooding and downright scary at times . Yet he 's also cheerful , funny , nice , and even loving towards Adele . Granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the TV and strangle him but that 's probably just me ( and the character Pitt played in the movie . ) But it also shows how good Pitt 's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character , that is what good acting is supposed to do . < br /><br />At any rate I wish I could say more , but that 's all I can really say without having seen the ending , I have seen most of the movie through what I 've caught on Fuse and as I 'm writing this I 'm taping it on DVR so hopefully I can write a more complete review later . I just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that I thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked ( it should n't have ! )
1 This movie is great ! Brad Pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie . Duchovny was top notch , as was Forbes and Lewis . The 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites , in one of the coolest cars ever made , 1960 's model Lincoln Continental . Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage . He likes his women to not curse or smoke , and wear PWT dresses . Duchovny and Forbes are a pair of artists from the city , while Early and Lewis are Trailer parkers from the rural outskirts . Even though the majority tone in the film is dark , there are plenty of funny scenes to be had . The writing , directing , and acting are brilliant . If you like road movies , murder , humor , and narration , watch this film . Everyone delivers , and you will want more when the credits roll . One of my all time favorites . " hey ... shave that dog n teach it to hunt ! "
1 I have to start off by apologizing because I thought the first 75 - 80 % of this film was hilarious . It 's mostly because of Brad Pitt 's performance . Spot on.<br /><br />The acting by all involved was quite good but Brad stole the movie . The atmosphere was perfect in all respects . I 'm not a giant Pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever.<br /><br />Brutal , Honest , Gritty . All good words to describe this movie.<br /><br />I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early 's violence is n't explained . It is explained but they thankfully do n't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across.<br /><br />Overall I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective . I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie . Underrated .
1 David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California , but ca n't really afford to , so they ' ride share " with another young couple ( Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ) to save on expenses . The idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way , sites where serial killers did their thing , since Brian ( Duchovny ) is a writer and Carrie ( Forbes ) is his photographer . What they do n't know is that Pitt ( Earley ) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever HE says . I do n't care for Pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles . The scary thing is that he does them so well ; I 've actually KNOWN people like him before , no , not killers , but with pretty much the same mindset . Anyway , as the road trip goes along , Carrie guesses that the others are about out of money , but Earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow .... never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though . Lewis does her role well , one that she excels at , a not - too - bright waif that has a good heart but does n't understand that she does n't have to put up with being beaten up by Earley when she does something he does n't like . As things begin to get more unacceptable Carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station , and unfortunately it 's at that point where she 's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they 've been ride - sharing with , after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip . This is not the greatest flick in the world , but it 's not bad ... I watched what was supposed to be the ' unrated ' version but I wonder how much was cut out of the rated version , because this seemed fairly tame to me , really ... not that this makes it family fare or anything , unless it 's maybe the Manson Family . 7 out of 10 .
1 " Kalifornia"is a great film that makes us look at ourselves . The film has a great cast , Brad Pitt(Johnny Suede , A River Runs Through It , and The Legends Of The Fall)as Early Grayce , David Duchovny(The X Files)as Brian Kessler , Michelle Forbes(Star Trek : The Next Generation , Homicide : Life On The Street , and Escape From L.A.)as Carrie Loughlin , Brian 's girlfriend , and Juliette Lewis(Natural Born Killers , Cape Fear , and What 's Eating Gilbert Grape)as Adele Corners , Early 's girlfriend.<br /><br />Brian Kessler is a writer who is a Liberal , is getting ready to write a book about serial killers . Brian and his girlfriend , Carrie decide they want to move to California , so Brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to California , to share expenses on the trip.<br /><br />Early Grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole , who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town , is in debt , owes his landlord money . Early 's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job . Early goes to the college and sees the ad , he later tells Adele , his girlfriend about leaving to go to California . Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town . Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord . For a little while Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends , Carrie and Adele become real good friends.<br /><br />Their journey is a very learning one . Though Brain and Carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie . The question Brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question . Early Grayce is a sociopath who does n't see the error of his ways , goes down hill later on and pays the price.<br /><br />This film is a great movie , I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up . I love the songs in the movie , especially at the end of the film , the song"Look Up To The Sky"by The Indians .
1 So - so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis , who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west . The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book ; Pitt 's a serial killer on the lam ( unbeknownst to Dave ) and Juliette is his poor , not - all - there companion . This is a good cast and the story moves along , but Pitt is n't belivably scary as a serial killer , although it is one of his better earlier roles . The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes , who always manages to shine , whether in her roles on ` Homicide : Life on the Street ' or in the brief series ` Wonderland.'<br /><br />Vote : 6
1 " Kalifornia " is a good Hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross - country to California to share the cost of gas : A pair of losers ( Lewis & Pitt ) and two wannabee artists , a photographer and a writer ( Duchovny & Forbes ) . Pitt " nails " his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller . A good watch for those into psycho - killer flix .
1 LOVE AT THE TOP -- the utterly wrongheaded American title for the superb French film " Le Mouton Enrage " ( which means , I think , The Rabid Sheep)-- is such an original movie , the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding . This film was far ahead of its time ; even by today 's highest standards , it accomplishes things that seem rich and new . Filmed by the hugely underrated director Michel Deville , it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique , comedy , mystery , love , sex and satire into one wholly original mix -- leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable . The cast is splendid , ditto the writing and theme . But it 's Deville 's delicious tone , keeping you constantly off - balance but enrapt , that pushes this " lost " film to a very high level indeed . ( The written interview with the director on the " Special Features " section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have the time . )
1 Nicolas Mallet is a failure . A teller in a bank , everyone walks all over him . Then his friend , a writer who 's books no one likes , has a plan to change his life . Our hero tells his boss he is quitting . He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women . And he manages to do just that.<br /><br />If it were not for the amount of death ( murder / suicide / natural causes ) in the film , this would be a farce . There are numerous jabs at marriage , politics , journalism and ... life.<br /><br />Jean - Louis Trintignant is a likable amoral rogue . Romy Schneider is at her most appealing . Definitely worth a look .
1 This is a comedy of morals , so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs , but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything.<br /><br />This film , marvelously written and directed , is a gem that shines perfectly , with beautiful acting by all . Jean - Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual , and Romy Schneider is a pearl , perfect and glowing , that is not to be missed . A truly wonderful film ! !
1 " Like the first touch of pleasure and guilt , like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear , like a climax of contrary emotions " said one of the movie buffs after viewing LOVE AT THE TOP , the misinterpreted title version of stylish director Michel Deville 's LE MOUTON ENRAGE . < br /><br />Vincent Canby in New York Times , however , just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated : " LOVE AT THE TOP which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse , is a 1973 French comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen - fifties English comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition . " Yet , the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that LOVE AT THE TOP is not concerned with the English class system ... (January 27 , 1975)<br /><br />Having left the evaluations up to single individuals , of course , the test of time has done its just job . What may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like LE MOUTON ENRAGE where decadence appears innocent , where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic , where feelings occur so manipulative . < br /><br />For Romy Schneider 's fans , it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see , not only because she gives a unique performance ( as she did in all of her roles ) at the heyday of her career ( 9 years before her sudden death ) but because she is particularly attractive here . It is not TRIO INFERNAL where the , so to say , ' forced escape ' from and the mockery of Romy 's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine Sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation , but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role . She plays Roberte , a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story 's lead , playboy Nicolas Mallet ( Jean Louis Trintignant ) . It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons . This movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of Romy and she is given some of her very best scenes . Romy 's sex appeal is unforgettable here.<br /><br />Another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception . Immoral as it may seem , the director makes a perfect use of contrast : conventions vs pleasures , innocence vs decadence , genuine lust vs instrumental affair . Nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest , may find attractive or disgusting ; yet , his are the features the viewers must treat seriously , more to say , they are the ones we all must accept . That is why , one is led to a peculiar , gently wild , erotically unique world of the main character . Although he sleeps with lots of women , there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for Nicola : Roberte Groult ( Romy Schneider ) and Marie - Paul ( Jane Birkin ) . He manipulates them , makes love to them , can not refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money ; yet , he perceives them differently . Yet , despite all of this ' adult maturity , ' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy - car on the table - a sort of ' detailed insight into male mind ... ' in a comedy - like way , of course.<br /><br />Finally , there are very good performances , which makes LE MOUTON ENRAGE slightly underrated . Not only the aforementioned Romy Schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role , but young Jane Birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young , inexperienced streetwalker Marie Paul , Jean Louis Trintignant makes it possible to see Nicola in the right way . This artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by Camille Saint - Saëns , the tune that will ring in your ears for long . Therefore , apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors , slow action ( sometimes ) , possible clichés ( noticed by some viewers ) , the merits should be found significant . < br /><br />LE MOUTON ENRAGE , in sum , is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life . It is worth seeing as a moment in Romy 's career , a prelude to strong eroticism , a chain of contrary emotions , of love and hatred , appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm ... But are n't we , humans , ' viewers , ' movie buffs built upon such contrasts ?
1 The author of " Nekromantik " , Jörg Buttgereit 's second feature film , " Der Todesking " is a powerful masterpiece . Centered around a chain letter originating from a group called " The Brotherhood of the 7th Day " , the movie shows 7 episodes , each consisting of one day during one week , where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it 's rounds . Do not touch this one if you like Hollywood movies or musicals , enjoy happy or even remotely " normal " movies or expect a movie to be good only , if it is focused on stage acting.<br /><br />The nihilistic , avant - garde approach of Der Todesking well explains , why Buttgereit 's movies in general were banned in Germany , their native country of origin , during the 80 's and most of the 90 's . Der Todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on - screen , but the meaningless apathy or depression most people 's lives consist of in general . Buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living , only reasons to stop , and in choosing how and when you die , you can also be the king of death , Der Todesking.<br /><br />Buttgereit 's movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception . Featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies , " art film " would probably be the closest description every time . Der Todesking features an original method to shoot , create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene . During one scene , the camera slowly , continuously pans in 360 degree circle , while a person lives in a small one - room apartment for a day . During another , Buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man , while he dwells in his desperation . During a third , seemingly pleasant scene names , ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on - screen , supposedly warranting the ban in Germany for this particular movie.<br /><br />Episode movies ( and especially this one , as the scenes are only vaguely connected ) generally suffer from incoherence , and Der Todesking is no exception . While all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it 's consequences or subsequences in all it 's variations , there are very powerful episodes , yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material , partly draining the overall power of the movie - still , the the jaw - dropping , immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it 's more vague moments back to the status of greatness . The general atmosphere is baffling , awe - inspiring , highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival I took part of.<br /><br />This is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come . Not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans , this is a small , different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience . Whether it be confusion , amazement or even hate , you are n't likely to be left cold by this , in my opinion the best , achievement of this small indie crew.<br /><br />The main theme of the movie , " Die Fahrt ins Reich der Menschentrümmer part I - III " was released in a limited 666-piece 8 " vinyl edition , which is now much sought after . You still can get the classical masterpiece by getting " The Nekromantik " soundtrack CD , which I highly recommend . The Lo - Fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky , almost illbient - like , makes an essential part of the movie 's atmosphere , and is something you would very , very rarely hear otherwise . Much recommended !
1 I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes ( the love of the dead ) or something similar . This of course awoke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking ( The Death King ) . The Nekromantik movies are Ok , even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia ( even if they obviously are horror - opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind , they are actually quite funny.)<br /><br />TODESKING , on the other hand is , in my opinion , one of the best films ever made . It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death . Death as an enemy ; Death as a reliever , Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body . The film is a metaphor over life . It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are . It reduces its viewers to the childs they ( we ) actually are . The fact that we can not really understand the nature of Death , and hence neither the process of dying , is the core message of the film . This is a most realistic film . Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever . No matter what moral standards you set up , death is unevitable , and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality . This applies to YOU , Dear Reader , like it applies to the viewers of the film . Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this , which is fully excused , since they of course will live forever ... <br /><br />This is no exploitation movie . Why ? Because death does not exploit us humans . It harvests us . We grow for seven days , then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre - birth , that is Death . Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales . Whether you choose to regard it as " optimistic " or " pessimistic " is up to you . At first glance it may seem very dark . Consider though , that in order for something to live , something else must die . " Who wants to live forever?" < br /><br />I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body , that are being consumed by maggots , he shows not only decomposition , but GENERATION of new life . Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil , than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre?<br /><br />When you realize this , you see Der Todesking it its right context.<br /><br />Sieben Tage hat die Woche , siebenmal letzte Stunden . Seven are the days of week ( weak , mortal ! ) , seven times the last hour.<br /><br />Dont fear the Reaper , Buttgereit tells us , because the Reaper takes only what is ripe . And apples that are not plucked for food will rot!<br /><br />Have a good life , fellow IMDB'ers ! < br /><br />(And watch this film , that compares only to Ingemar Bergmans " The Seventh Seal " in terms of depth and universality )
1 " Der Todesking "- Jorg Buttgereit 's second full - length feature film(the first one was notorious " Nekromantik")has no central character or characters , but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide . Divided into days of the week , it comprises of a series of set - pieces , each of which featuring the self - destruction of a complete stranger . Yes , the production values are low and it 's disturbing , but in many ways " Der Todesking " is extremely effective . It makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment . Unlike the other Buttgereit 's works it is n't very gory , but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the Tuesday episode , a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide . The last(Sunday)episode is so depressing and full of pain!-just amazing if you want my opinion.10 out of 10-check out this post - modernism shocker!Disturbing art in the purest form !
1 My god ! Buttgereit 's masterpiece is one of the best movies I 've ever seen . Closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean - Luc Godard 's movies , this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the Nekromantiks . All the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive , in spite of the lack of money ( see the " bridge " sketch ) . Highly highly recommended !
1 " Der Todesking " is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry   Jörg Buttgereit 's second cult monument in a row , which is actually a lot better than the infamous " Nekromantik " , exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people 's suicides . In between these already very disturbing episodes , Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse . The episodes are n't all equally powerful but , as a wholesome , " Der Todesking " is ranked quite high on the list of all - time most depressing art - house films . Particularly the episodes on Wednesday , involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park , and the one of Sunday , focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead , are extremely intense and devastating to observe . The added value of this film , or any other shockumenary like it , is debatable and I 'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here . There 's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people 's motivations to end their lives so dramatically . Entirely unlike I expected , " Der Todesking " is n't exploitative or repulsively graphic ! On the contrary actually , I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery . The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this , as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names , ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen . The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism , but this is n't what really counts in this type of cinema . The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life . GREAT use of tragic music , too !
1 Jörg Buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times , even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify . They are artistically made , with also often deeper meaning to its themes . This movie is a perfect example of his work.<br /><br />It 's also really hard to label this movie . It 's not really a movie with a story to it , in a sense of having a beginning , middle and end in it . It also does n't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings , on 7 different days.<br /><br />All different stories are being told with lots of class , though some of them are of course more ' interesting ' and realistic than the others . They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story . The movie does n't feel disjointed at all . All different stories have a different feel to it and Buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words ( also typical for his style ) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story . It helps to make this movie an effective one to watch.<br /><br />Again , the production values all are n't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people . It however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark , disturbing and depressing themes.<br /><br />A Buttgereit movie that I ' enjoyed ' watching.<br /><br />7/10
1 What 's the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking ? Let me start by saying I 've just come direct from viewing this movie , and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I do n't think they 'll be moving any time soon.<br /><br />It 's probably fair to say that if you 're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you have n't seen it . If not , let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate - budget gem that 's been lost for a few years a la " Near Dark " , nor is it a low budget , schlocky , " fun " B - movie . What it is it low - budget art , put forward in a simple yet poignant way . The idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around , and ending in , suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse . Sounds simple right , even boring ? It is n't . Words ca n't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through ; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not.<br /><br />I could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction ; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky . I could point out that some of the sound effects are out - of - sync in a way to rival any Fulci movie , but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance.<br /><br />As far as extreme movies go , I 've seen the hardest of them , and yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed , despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that I would consider " gratuitous " . In fact , the most disturbing scene I found was the last tale . I wo n't ruin it , just to say that the character 's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise , if not yearn for his end . < br /><br />Sure , it 's not the best movie ever made , and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish , but in spite of these flaws Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema . If you 're someone who likes comfortable viewing or " nice " movies , or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless , this is not what you 're looking for . < br /><br />Whether you enjoy it or not , It 's one you wo n't forget in a hurry .
1 DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it 's reasons and ramifications . Those looking for a gore - fest , or exploitation in the style of the NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed . DER TODESKING is definitely an " art - house " style film , so those that need linear , explainable narratives need not apply ... <br /><br />The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an " episode " for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide , interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse ... <br /><br />There are some very well done and thought provoking scenes , including the man talking about the " problems " with his wife , and the concert massacre ( which unfortunately lost some of it 's " power " on me , because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS look - alike band on stage ... ) . But seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful ( the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene , and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge ... ) , sometimes confusing , sometimes silly ( the SHE WOLF OF THE SS rip - off is pretty amusing ) , sometimes harrowing ( I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective ) film that is more of an " experience " then just entertainment , as many of these " art " films are meant to be . Still , I did n't find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM , and would probably put it on relatively even footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personally " enjoyment level " . Definitely worth a look to any Buttgereit or " art " film fan . If you dig this type of film - check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion the BEST art - house / horror film that I 've seen . 7/10 for DER TODESKING
1 I just ca n't agree with the above comment - there 's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one , it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it 's effective use of silence . What 's more , it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way , not pulling any punches in what it shows , yet not dwelling and over - sensationalising the subject matter . it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art - house cinema , and deserves a place amongst the canon of ' different ' horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring ( both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on ) . It 's definitely worth seeing if you 're interested in the edges of horror cinema .
1 Excellent episode movie ala Pulp Fiction . 7 days - 7 suicides . It does nt get more depressing than this . Movie rating : 8/10 Music rating : 10/10
1 I just finished watching the 139 min version ( widescreen ) with some friends and we were blown away . I wo n't bother repeating what others have said . What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun . The huge battle is exhausting . Afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that did n't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.<br /><br />There is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music / songs . Blues , Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter . It 's hideous . You have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.<br /><br />There are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera . There are many uses of silence as well as slow - motion photography that work beautifully . I really wish I could erase the music but alas.<br /><br />Seek this out . It 's fun , it 's different and it takes you to places you would n't expect and that 's very refreshing .
1 I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood , I could n't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery . But I did really like the concept . If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie . That said , having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it , though not as much as when I was seven ( I remembered the ending ) . < br /><br />There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments , my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ) . < br /><br />For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll . By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing , when seven I though the ' relationship ' guff was a bad thing.<br /><br />For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action , especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors . The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and , lets face it , humorous . I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid , and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general do n't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum , they 've got heavy calibre machine guns , mortars , rocket launchers , a tank and a helicopter and they 're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs . Which is what I 'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.<br /><br />In short the movies worth watching , it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise , and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I. Samurai is so unique .
1 Pop quiz : you 're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history . What do you do ? Well , if you 're a Hollywood studio , you change the Japanese G.I.s in G.I. Samurai ( aka Timeslip ) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier , have them debate stopping the attack on Pearl Harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no - one reminds you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie . But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown , this sees its premise through : thrown back 400 years into the Japanese feudal wars , its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action , including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other . And yes , there are decapitations.<br /><br />Of course , things do n't go as planned , and even superior firepower does n't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers . Even before that , the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home , those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the Hell of it . Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through , the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction , especially when they feature English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who audibly ca n't pronounce the words let alone speak the language , but it 's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci - fi actioner.<br /><br />Optimum 's UK DVD is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version .
1 " GI Samurai " sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal Japan for no particular reason , and much carnage ensues . It 's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.<br /><br />The plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title ; initial fish - out - the - water antics ( " what is this flying metal box ? " etc etc ) , " are n't we better off here " discussions and ultimately a huge battle . The latter is proof that the film does n't take itself seriously at all , the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles Chiba 's platoon ; a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance . It 's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and does n't drag despite its extended length.<br /><br />Chiba gives a gruff performance as Iba , initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him . This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific CV . By the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers , as they seem to be asking " were n't we better off back then ? ' . But this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of ( almost ) non stop action .
1 What if a platoon of G.I. 's from the Japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate ? Great pitch right ? The movie does exactly what it says on the tin.<br /><br />Thankfully the writers did n't bother to explain the , usually ridiculous in sci - fi movies , scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport . No how 's or why 's . They just did . However the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful , if not a bit dated . Not as silly as one would imagine.<br /><br />The rest of the movie follows the premise to a T. But while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the G.I.s arrival to medieval Japan , it picks up with a devastating battle sequence . Undoubtedly it 's the main order of the day . The whole concept and by extension the movie itself , was probably originated from this simple pitch : what if G.I. 's equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais ? And boy does it deliver.<br /><br />The main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of THE best of its kind in 70 's action / war movies . Not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length , it 's also a terrific mish - mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like G.I. Samurai can deliver . I mean , where else would you get the chance to feature tanks , ninjas complete with shuriikens , a helicopter and samurais in the same shot ? The G.I. platoon led by lieutenant Iba tears literally through hundreds of extras , gunning them down with machine guns , mortars , grenades and tanks.<br /><br />This mish - mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai - geki epic of Kurosawa 's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki 's Samurai Banners , while the other is in western action and war movies . There are stylistic touches ( like the wonderful slow - motion shots and bloody violence ) that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari circa Keoma to mind . Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood works and vice versa , and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turns this east - meets - west melting pot into an exciting film.<br /><br />The film - makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it . Not that tongue - in - cheek mentality is completely absent , it 's just that it does n't try to pander to so - bad - it's - good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies . The budget was probably hefty , as it is evident in the hundreds of extras , elaborate costumes ( very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai - geki ) and special effects . The camera - work and editing are all top notch , almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves.<br /><br />It 's not withouts its flaws either of course . There are many " song " scenes , where all sorts of 70 's Japanese rock , disco and country songs play over montages ( there 's a bonding scene , a love - interest scene , a " war is hell " scene etc ) . The songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing . Although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes , it flies like a bullet for the most part . Still some scenes , flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.<br /><br />The cast also deserves a mention , featuring such prominent names as Sonny Chiba , Isao Natsuyagi ( Goyokin , Samurai Wolf ) , Tsunehiko Watase ( The Yakuza Papers ) and Hiroyuki Sanada , all of them hitting the right notes .
1 I waited for this movie to come out for a while in Canada , and when it finally did , I was very excited to see it . I really enjoyed it . Of course , in the beginning , it is a very sad movie ( and it was New Years Day - making it even sadder ) - however , it sticks with you . The next day I was thinking about it again , because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining , you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story . How one person can be seen as the link to so many people , but sometimes you can be blinded so many things . And how Diane Keaton 's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there . And how they save her in the process as well . It was such an excellent movie , and Chris Pine ( one of my favourite actors ) provides the perfect comic relief . It is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues , but will really stay with you for a long time .
1 The movie held my interest , mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress . I disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted . I had no trouble following it ( maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before ) . The movie was very sad and touching as well . What more do you want ? Alexa Davalos is a fine new talent ( beautiful too ) , and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with his part as well . The relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic , but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not . It was tragically sad but enlightening . It sure beat the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening
1 Charles McDougall 's resume includes directing episodes on ' Sex and the City ' , ' Desperate Housewives ' , Queer as Folk ' , ' Big Love ' , ' The Office ' , etc . so he comes with all the credentials to make the TV film version of Meg Wolitzer 's novel SURRENDER , DOROTHY a success . And for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloat.<br /><br />Sara ( Alexa Davalos ) a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends - gay playwright Adam ( Tom Everett Scott ) , Adam 's current squeeze Shawn ( Chris Pine ) , and married couple Maddy ( Lauren German ) and Peter ( Josh Hopkins ) with their infant son - to a house in the Hamptons for a summer vacation . The group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by Adam and Sara ) results in an auto accident which kills Sara . Meanwhile Sara 's mother Natalie Swedlow ( Diane Keaton ) who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting ' Surrender , Dorothy ' , is playing it up elsewhere : when she receives the phone call that Sara is dead she immediately comes to the Hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among Sara 's friends . Slowly but surely Natalie uncovers secrets about each of them , thriving on talking about Sara as though doing so would bring her to life . Natalie 's thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed Sara that they all eventually come together.<br /><br />Diane Keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together . The screenplay has its moments for good lines , but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given . Yes , this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures - but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching .

1 I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . For instance , the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could " Hollywood " just throw in a token gay character in the movie . And besides there was two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other great . One was normal and the other was more feminine but it was n't over the top . And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . For instance when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . But I guess if you 're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . But if you 're more open - minded and I do n't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you 'll enjoy this film .
1 I very much enjoyed watching this film . I taped it while watching so that i could review it later . I actually enjoyed the second viewing more since i was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between Natalie and Adam , the 2 main characters . I thought the way this story evolved was very thought provoking . I got very intrigued with how Natalie was going to interact with her daughter 's friends , at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of animosity but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold . i was n't disappointed . Gradually the secrets that Sara kept from her mother started to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect , a flawed human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a domineering mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom . The viewers who stuck with this film to the end saw a very touching performance from Diane Keaton ( who is always wonderful , even in some of her less well received films - think Town and Country ) . The closing scene of Diane Keaton driving home was well worth waiting for , revealing that anyone who loves another human being has got to learn that we have to live our own lives , we love others but do n't own them and ultimately we have to let go . It 's a hard lesson but well worth contemplating now and then . Thank you CBS for this broadcast , it was worth the long wait .
1 Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets . Diane Keaton,(Natalie),"The Family Stone",'05 , who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe . She always called her and told her , " Surrender Dorothy " , which was an expression used in the ' Wizard of Oz',1939 . A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter 's friends and lovers . As Natalie investigates , the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter . Great film to view and enjoy , especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors .
1 I thought this was one of the best movies I 've seen in a very long time . It was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways . Have recommended it to all my friends ! ! I always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best I 've seen in a long time . I could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that Natalie did to find out more about her life and loves . It showed how we not only have lives with our families ; but also have parts of our lives that we do n't share with them - as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we do n't do that we are so proud of.<br /><br />I look forward to another such movie , and will keep my eye out .
1 This was a great movie with a good cast , all of them hitting on all cylinders . And when Dianne Keaton is at her best , well , it just does n't get any better than that . But Tom Everett Scott , always underrated , was even better . He should be a star . < br /><br />My only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay . None of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter was n't always a good person . And neither was her mother , played by Keaton . At one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around . < br /><br />One of the other commentators said the movie had a " political agenda " . That is a baffling thing to say . There was no politics at all in this movie .
1 Have never understood why the MacDonald - Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly -- not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone . To me , " I Married an Angel " is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo 's more celebrated outings . The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical , the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ( " San Francisco , " " The Women , " " Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , " etc . ) , the Rodgers and Hart tunes ( albeit altered a bit by MacDonald - Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest ) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart ( Oscar - winner for scoring " The Wizard of Oz " ) , and best of all , the " singing sweethearts " look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings . Try to show " Rose Marie " or " Sweethearts " to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still , but this offbeat , fast - paced fantasy is bound to entertain .
1 It appears that there 's no middle ground on this movie ! Most of it takes place in a dream and , like most dreams , it 's often foolish and illogical . It 's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances , especially by our angel.<br /><br />Jeanette 's deadpan , unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious , and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight . At one point , she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen , followed by the final trio of Faust ( holding a lapdog , for some strange reason ) , then " Aloha Oe " on the beach ! < br /><br />It 's a surreal comedy -- tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove .
1 Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this " modern " musical that showcases MacDonald 's comic abilities . Surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue . Eye - popping costumes and sets ( yes B&W ) add to the surreal , dreamlike quality of the entire film . Several good songs enliven the film , with the " Twinkle in Your Eye " number a total highlight , including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes . Also in the HUGE cast are Edward Everett Horton , Reginal Owen , Mona Maris , Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys . Also to been seen in extended bit parts are Esther Dale , Almira Sessions , Grace Hayle , Gertrude Hoffman , Rafaela Ottiano , Odette Myrtile , Cecil Cunningham and many others.<br /><br />Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug / vamp routines . She could do it all .
1 I know a lot of people do n't like this movie , but I just think it is adorable . There 's not much I can say , but the movie is a feel - good movie I guess . The songs are beautiful , the costumes are beautiful , the voices are beautiful , and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie , especially as Briggitta learns about the do 's and do n't 's of society . If you like musicals , I 'd say you 'd like this one !
1 The movie is a fantasy . The story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully . ( I still can not believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well . ) Some of the dialog is wonderfully clever . The costumes made me feel as though I was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942.<br /><br />Movies are designed to serve various purposes . This one is designed to entertain and it certainly does . If I have one negative comment it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing Count . Some of the closeups made me uncomfortable . But he could still sing and sing magnificently . However , Jeanette MacDonald was just as dazzling as ever . She makes a spectacular angel.<br /><br />This genre is well before my time , and I an new to the Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy films and related conversation . The music in this movie is beautiful . As much as I love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies , there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable , more delightful , better constructed . The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in the movie theaters today . And Jeanette MacDonald , without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons , was more beautiful than the stars I see today . I am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies . They say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is . And those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what ? I think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten . There is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed . I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent , great beauty and great music .
1 One used to say , concerning Nathaniel Hawthorne , that his failures were more interesting than his successes . I believe that the same remark could suit to McDonald - Eddy 's pictures . And especially this one . < br /><br />It apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie : it 's kitsch , the script , because of censorship , sounds inconsistent   Yet , this movie gets also some good points : good Rodgers - Hart 's music ( " I married an angel " , " Tira tira tira la " ) , good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen . < br /><br />Anyway , if you may dislike it , you ca n't forget it . This strange movie actually leaves a very strong , dreamlike , impression , and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days , maybe for weeks . Why ? In the thirties and the beginning of the forties , movies did n't have the same mean than today : it aimed , like a dream , to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality . Of all the the dream - movies that was made , in that time , this one stands as particularly powerful.<br /><br />In short , let 's say that the better way to appreciate this movie , is to watch it without wondering whether it 's good or bad . To watch it , like you would watch a dream .
1 My observations : vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful , exotic and fantastic . Jeanette wore it well , and got even with naive Nelson . Boat crashing into his balcony served him right . Costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well , especially by today 's standards . 1942 costume designer did great job . Main song theme just lovely.<br /><br />Caution to negative posters : 1942 was time of WW II ; Pearl Harbor happened year before . U.S. just coming out of Great Depression ; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing , dance and yes , fantastic fantasy . Despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in RL , snuffing out freedoms . Thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend . Movie going was a privileged treat , in those depressing times . When you , negative posters , become actors or even movie stars , then YOU have room to talk and criticize . Jeanette 's and Nelson 's movies stand the test of time.<br /><br />Angel wings wonderful , on the real angel . RL wings at costume party not so hot , but great on Jeanette considering the SL.<br /><br />Beautiful singing by Jeanette and Nelson , as always . Jeanette dancing was a pure delight.<br /><br />15/10
1 There was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer . For starters , the casting did n't seem right . Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in " 24 " and the preview did n't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience . Eva Longoria appeared out of place , and the rest did n't seem very interesting.<br /><br />When the film finally ended , I was not completely displeased for I had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better , had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development . We have seen threats of this type before , and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers . As an audience , we do n't want to sit through the same old story again . We want to see something different , be thrilled and entertained.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the casting . From Kim Basinger 's delicious first lady . She carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable . Michael Douglas has been and done that before . Unfortunately , the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate . Sutherland rehashes his " 24 " tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen , and Eva does a passable job , as the newcomer.<br /><br />Don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ( " North by Northwest " and " The Fugitive " come to mind ) . Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be . It 's o.k .
1 It 's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used " Wall Street " to let us know that greed is good . Now , Michael Douglas takes the GG persona and morphs it into a Secret Service agent , Pete Garrison . Guess what ? It works ! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing . The detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was likewise intriguing . All the leads were pretty good but , try as I might , I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent . Whereas Jodie Foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was FBI agent Starling in " Silence of the Lambs " , you do not get the same feeling with Longoria . Nevertheless , this is a fun film , escapist entertainment with the Beltway as the backdrop .
1 At first glance , this film looks like the Keifer Sutherland series 24 for the big screen . With the focus on a plot to assassinate the President of the United States , a race against time , and plenty of Secret Service agents , the agency under the spotlight in The Sentinel.<br /><br />But wait , the protagonist turns out to be Michael Douglas ' character Pete Garrison instead , a veteran Secret Service agent famed for taking the bullet for Reagan in 1981 . The SS agents are specially trained to " take the bullet " , which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target ? But Garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot , and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot . All this because of his failure in a polygraph test , due to his adulterous banging of the First Lady ( Kim Basinger ) . Tsk.<br /><br />There are shades of Clint Eastwood 's In the Line of Fire . Both featured aging actors , and aging veteran has - been heroes with a bit of a historical reference , who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty . While Eastwood 's movie has a more enigmatic villain in John Malkovich , The Sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain , preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex - KGB villains , and the mole within the Presidential Detail . With Douglas on the run from the law , he becomes similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive , hunting the proverbial one - armed man while at the same time , relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents , which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes , it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents.<br /><br />Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria , top TV stars of today from 24 and Desperate Housewives , get relegated into support roles as the Secret Service investigators who are looking into Garrison 's probable involvement in the assassination plot , and at times seem to have lept off the pages of CSI with their forensics skills . The beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled X - Files ' Fox Mulder and Dana Scully , but alas these two had very little to do here . We know the reason why they 're in the movie , and that is to get their fans into the theatres . Also , Longoria 's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy - mama Gabrielle , and here , has her in fairly low cut blouses ( Sutherland actually tells her to cover up ) and tight pants ( ogle - fest for fellow agents).<br /><br />Nonetheless , it 's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world , and the typical threats that they face daily , including the following up on every nutcase 's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world . It 's a decent suspense and investigative thriller , with enough subplots to keep you entertained . But one thing though , like most ending action sequences , this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through .
1 I enjoyed this film . I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that 's never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot . Unfortunately , for Michael Douglas ' character , " Pete Garrison , " they think HE 's the mole but he is n't . < br /><br />He 's just a morally - flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady ! Since he 's doing that , he 's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it 's revealed there is a plot to kill the President.<br /><br />"Garrison " is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he 's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the President . Douglas does a fine job in this role . I do n't always care the people he plays but he 's an excellent actor . Keifer Sutherland ( " David Breckinridge " ) is equally as good ( at least in here ) as the fellow SS boss who hunts down Douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth . When he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop , if they can , the plot . The crooks are interesting , too , by the way . Also , I have never - and never will , unfortunately - see a First Lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger < br /><br />This is simply a slick action flick that entertains start - to - finish . Are there holes in it ? Of course ; probably a number of them , and a reason you see so many critical comments . However , it is unfairly bashed here . It just is n't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website . My advice : chill , just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue . Yes , it gets a little Rambo - ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment ..... which is what movies are all about .
1 I thought that The sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie . When I finally saw it , I took a good surprise . The movie is n't great thing but it 's very fun and the action scenes are very well done . This movie reminded me TV series like 24 or Alias . It 's very similar to that series and it reminded me too , to the Wolfgang Petersen 's thriller In the line of fire . If you 're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies , you will be disappointed . But if you go with little expectations , you will enjoy The sentinel.<br /><br />Rating:7
1 I can admit that the screenplay is n't very good , and that it has some slow parts , but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun . First of all , the performances are great ( Michael Douglas , Kim Basinger , Kiefer Sutherland , and Eva Longoria . Michael Douglas proves he has still got it , and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife . Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria , play the dynamic duo , both adding their incredible talent to the pot . And second of all , this movie is the most fun I have had in years in a Theodore . Its plain and simple , if you want to go to the movies , and have a lot of fun see , The Sentinel .
1 The Sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right . A great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it was n't and it was a very smart story . Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland is too , but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as Jack Bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in The Sentinel than he is in 24.also another person trying to shrug off their TV role but failed . Eva Longeria . She was n't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing . After i saw the film i had constant dreams about The Sentinel and could n't sleep . Overall Sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it .
1 The Sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense / mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing . These stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear , so what we 're left with is how good is the acting , how smart are the setups and bad guys , how well crafted is the main plot etc etc ..... so the Sentinel does a solid job given it 's content . Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes . Eva Longoria ( first time I 've seen her on screen ) brings some satisfactory support . The whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit , but it deserves slack . Worth a viewing if you like the genre .
1 Good for an evening 's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing . Garrison 's affair with the First Lady was unreal and passionless ; the President was a cardboard cut - out . And who were the real villains anyway ? Nothing was developed or explained sufficiently . I still do n't know why they wanted to kill the President or how the mole got involved . The villains were nameless and undeveloped , so you never felt involved in their plot . Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good . But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both unbelievable in their roles , Basinger totally lacked character and no way could Longoria have been a Secret Service agent . This could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way , with too many unanswered questions . Disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes . And did they use the ' West Wing ' set for the White House scenes ? - I kept expecting CJ or Charlie to appear !
1 This was a pretty decent movie . This movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained . Just a typical Hollywood film . This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely does n't deserve one , but I thought it was pretty good . It 's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format . If you like the whole we 've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick . I personally think that storyline has been done WAY too much , but The Sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the Secret Service . All in all , this movie wo n't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life , but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good ?
1 Seeing as Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of TV , it was a foregone conclusion i was gon na go to the movies and spend $ 15 on this . I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the President . As the investigation unfolds , it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete ( Michael Douglas ) . Pleading innocence , Pete goes on the fun , fugitive style , to search for the truth.<br /><br />It 's solid , but certainly not spectacular . A decent cast , a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty , but you could certainly do far worse .
1 I 'll be honest , I finally checked this movie not because of the stars -- though they were reasonably watchable and compelling , particularly the three leads -- or even the compelling story of a breach in the Presidential Secret Service(something , I've been informed through the DVD extras of this show , has yet to ever happen . Assuming that 's true , that 's remarkable ! ) . I got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis ! ! Well , okay , Clark Johnson , one of my faves from " Homicide : Life on the Street " and a veteran ( mostly ) TV director . I 'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average , despite the possibilities.<br /><br />Veteran and ace Secret agent Pete Garrison(Michael Douglass)has to find out both who is blackmailing him AND who killed his friend , targeted and blew up an Air Force One chopper and is gunning for the Prez.(David Rasche . Anyone remember " Sledgehammer " ? ) . His affair with the first lady(Kim Basinger , clearly one of the HOTTER first ladies we 've ever had , fictional or real)is certainly not helping his standing . He 's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief(Kiefer Sutherland , almost still completely in " 24 " mode ) . Throw in some other pivotal Service agents(Martin Donovan and the foxy , somewhat hard to buy as the gig Eva Longorria ) and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that does n't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired , if underwhelming , results.<br /><br />The summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers . The DVD extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie , though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most ( myself included ) interested .
1 It might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about . The Sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as In the Line of Fire and The Manchurian Candidate . The basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this : A plot to kill the President of the United States . Michael Douglas stars as Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed . Kiefer Sutherland co - stars as a sort of rival by the name of David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of Agent Breckinridge and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine . One improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an Action film as is a Thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the US President , it also concerns a mole(traitor ) in the Secret Service who is leading the President in the wrong direction .
1 My Take : Makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement . < br /><br />The plot is familiar . An innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the President of the United States , the first traitor in the United States Secret Service . As his fellow secret - service agents pursue him , he tries to prove his innocence . Of course we know his innocent , and the real culprit is just around the corner , but I was still entertained by THE SENTINEL . In this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences , THE SENTINEL is a good lick - back to all those good old - fashioned political crime thriller . The familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances.<br /><br />Michael Douglas , the perfect man for the job , is long - running Secret Service agent Pete Garrison , who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the President . Former colleagues in the secret service ( Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria ) pursue Harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the Secret Service . This leads to a lot of chase scenes that , surprisingly ( and thankfully ) , are never unbelievable . The screenplay also offers a subplot involving Garrison having an affair with the First Lady ( played by Kim Basinger ) . This thankfully was n't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films.<br /><br />The films director is Clark Johnson ( S.W.A.T. ) who manages to make the film look good . Although many have criticized it as " should have been a TV movie " , I must disagree . Agreed , this is not a perfect film , and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode from the TV series 24 ( which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star Sutherland ) , but even so , this film takes its plot into serious heights and does n't abandon even its smaller details . The performances are terrific ( with a top - notch cast , its bound to be , even with the by - the - numbers script.<br /><br />All - in - all , I award it * * * 1/2 , not perfect , but not far from it.<br /><br />Rating : * * * 1/2 out of 5 .
1 Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland . it 's been too long since you 've appeared in a movie , , and what a movie this was , was it 24 no , , but very intriguing , especially with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent . Kiefer 's character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie , , Kiefer 's partner , , is Eva Longoria , , the Desperate houswife . wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good , , i wish though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role , , but other than that , i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish . This movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller , everybody played their part to the hilt . nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie , , so as to keep you guessing at all times . and i really think that Kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie , , but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the besxt performance of the day , , thumbs up .
1 Engaging , riveting tale of captured US army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman . Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea.<br /><br />In the vein of classic courtroom dramas , " Sergeant Ryker " is an extremely well crafted mystery , ably guided by an outstanding cast , director Kulik 's constant momentum , and effective plot twists and turns.<br /><br />This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 , and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many " name " actors , and some action sequences . Dillman , reprising his role , is spot - on as the doubting defence attorney , whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of Ryker 's supportive , yet somewhat distant wife , played with aplomb by Vera Miles . Rounding out the frontline is Peter Graves for the prosecution , and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles.<br /><br />Marvin 's interpretation of the Paul Ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he 's placed . Marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference , to passionate determination , giving a convincing , often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small - scale drama . It 's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best - ever lists of courtroom dramas.<br /><br />However , despite its apparent obscurity , " Sergeant Ryker " still remains a taut and compelling examination , like a book that you just ca n't put down . Highly recommended .
1 Sergeant Ryker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War , a hanging offense . A long drawn out court - marshal ensues during which time the Sgt . must remain in a military jail . After much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non - com with an eleventh hour ploy . Very good picture .
1 The Korean War has been dubbed Americas 's forgotten war . So many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there . Occasionally , we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far - off , ghostly frozen graveyard . Here is perhaps one of the finest . It 's called " Sergeant Ryker . " The story is of an American soldier named Sgt . Paul Ryker ( Lee Marvin ) who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer . His task is to defect to the North Koreans and offer his services against United Nations forces . So successful is his cover , he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of Major . However , he is thereafter captured by the Americans , put on trial as a traitor and spy . Stating he was ordered to defect , he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence . He is convicted and sentenced to hang . However , his conviction is doubted by Capt . Young ( Bradford Dillman ) , his prosecutor . Convincing commanding Gen. Amos Baily , ( Lloyd Nolan ) of his doubts , he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed . The courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes Peter Graves , Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt . Max Winkler . Korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a Communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950 's . Due to its superior script and powerful message , this drama has become a courtroom Classic . Excellent viewing and recommended to all . * * * *
1 Love the characters and the story line . Very funny with plenty of action . Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances . I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career . Donald Southerland plays a very likable , and surprisingly sympathetic , burnt out hit man . All three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat . A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection . I highly recommend this movie . If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith , The Replacement Killers , L.A. Confidential , The Long Kiss Goodnight , The Abyss and , The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie .
1 This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time . All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer . It shows us that real life and " ficticious " action can produce a winning combination . Also , as a romantic comedy , it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other . Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like " They 're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars . "
1 The only thing serious about this movie is the humor . Well worth the rental price . I 'll bet you watch it twice . It 's obvious that Sutherland enjoyed his role .
1 The plot : A crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island , that would then serve as money - laundering facility for organized crime . To thwart that , the FBI tries to bust one of the mafia lords . The thing goes wrong , and by some unlikely plot twists and turns , we are presented with another " cop buddies who do n't like each other " movie ... one being a female FBI agent , and the other a male ex - DEA agent.<br /><br />So far , so stupid . But the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke , at best . It is funny . ( At least the synchronized German version is ) . The action is good , too , with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher . But the focus is squarely on the humour . Not intelligent satire , not quite slapstick , but somewhere in between , you get a lot of funny jokes . < br /><br />However , this film is the opposite of political correctness . Legal drug abuse is featured prominently , without criticism , and even displaying it as cool . That 's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me , and renders it unsuitable for kids , in my opinion . < br /><br />All in all , for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes , this movie is perfect . Just remember : In this genre , it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room . Then you 'll have a good time . 8/10
1 This film is one of the finest American B - movies of the 90s . If you 're looking for a serious film , look elsewhere . However , if you 're looking for some action , a lot of laughs , and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters , this is well worth watching . Everyone chews the scenery a bit , but that 's really what the film is all about , and everyone is quite funny . Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together .
1 I think Hollow Point is a funny film with some good moments I have never seen before in action movies . Well , both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith are n't so good in acting , but Tia Carrere is nice and good looking girl , is n't it ? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his role so - so mad gangster .
1 Hollow Point , though clumsy in places , manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie.<br /><br />The primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy.<br /><br />Oh , by the way , advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie ...
1 Re : Pro Jury < br /><br />Although the lead actress is STRIKINGLY beautiful , the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story.<br /><br />One may believe that middle - class teen - age school girls in the 1950 's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year - old 's they barely know , but I doubt it.<br /><br />"EASILY GIVE AWAY VIRGINITY " ? WHAT A SHREWD REMARK ABOUT THIS FILM . TRULY.<br /><br />One may believe that young high school teens are highly self - confident and self - assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations , but my experience has been , more often than not , teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world.<br /><br />YOU JUST AREN'T AT ALL ABLE TO SEE THE WORLD OTHER THAN THROUGH YOUR OWN EYES ? THAT 'S SAD.<br /><br />One may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of Stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake , but I think not . < br /><br />AND ANOTHER " EXPERT " OPINION DRAWN FROM EXPERIENCE . DANDY.<br /><br />One may believe that 30-something - year - old troublemakers can enter into , and hang around inside , a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble , but I think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents , chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this.<br /><br />NOW BE A GOOD SPORT AND TELL US AT WHICH INSTITUTION YOU GREW UP.<br /><br />One final nit , throughout Hey Babu Riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome . There is probably an explanation why the FIVE were the FOURsome , but because it was never detailed , each reference distracts from each scene.<br /><br />OF COURSE THERE 'S PROBABLY AN EXPLANATION . GOOD JOB FIGURING THAT OUT ! NOW I'LL BE GENEROUS AND WILL HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY : ALTHOUGH IT WAS TRANSLATED AS A GENERAL " FOURSOME " , THE WORD " & # 269;ETVORKA " HAS ANOTHER MEANING : IT 'S A SPORTS TERM USED TO DESIGNATE A 4 M OR 4W SETUP - A ROWING CREW CONSISTING OF 5 PERSONS : 4 ROWERS AND A COXSWAIN.<br /><br />This movie did not ring true for me.<br /><br />WE SHOULD ALL HEED TO YOUR COMPETENT AND PRAISEWORTHY OPINION . DUDE .
1 This is a masterpiece footage in B / W 35 mm film . The film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7:35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes.<br /><br />The short amazingly , gets you in a complex story using very little elements , and step to step makes you realize that something is n't totally right . It expresses a lot , makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details , and is incredibly understandable by anyone , not just the cinema critics experts.<br /><br />But I know how it sounds : European short , black and white and low budgeted . Do n't let that scare you . Is really worth to see by anyone , not just experts in the genre.<br /><br />Isn't really much more to tell , since the film just lasts 8 minutes ( exactly ) , and I do n't want to spoil it . But I just watched it online and I could n't understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it.<br /><br />Really worth watching it . 10/10 .
1 More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents . 7:35 De la mañana is absolute genius . What Nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some Hollywood directors hours of film to achieve . I watched this smiling , but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way . You sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min . nugget . I was entertained , but was disturbed at the same time . Not many people can do that in just 8 minutes . It starts off simple enough . A young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place . She sits down and someone starts singing . From there , the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe . It is in black & white , but this helps with the feeling the film gives you . This film makes you want to know more about the characters , how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward . I guess it like the old saying,"Leave them wanting more " , Nacho Vigalondo is able to do that . Watch this when you can . Show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes .
1 I was so glad I came across this short film . I 'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across , so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards , I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple , the director , writer , and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals . The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy.<br /><br />It 's a well made short film , well edited and the actors all do a great job . And the last shot of the film is perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film .
1 With a minimal budget , a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination , Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts I 've ever seen . The subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable , since it does n't give the ending away until the very last moment.<br /><br />Don't let anybody tell you what the short is about , since you 'll be able to enjoy it a lot more . Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one - man show : directing , writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort I 've seen in years . Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer , her reaction shots are incredible.<br /><br />Overall rating : 8/10
1 If you 're amused by straight - faced goings - on that are logical within a given illogical situation , you 'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish film.<br /><br />A woman enters a small café . The scene looks ordinary , but the counterman , customers , and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued.<br /><br />Suddenly , the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song , dancing across table tops with musical - comedy gestures . The customers , at first immobile , at intervals chime in ( badly but gamely ) with phrases from the song , read from slips of paper in their palms . On and off they jump up and dance ( awkwardly but earnestly ) in choreographed motions , like backup singers.<br /><br />But why ? ? ? the woman wonders . The answer is revealed as the soloist 's jacket opens and she sees what 's strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax ... <br /><br />Even if you do n't catch the song 's ( probably ironical ) lyrics , the situation - perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle ... I 'd love to see it again !
1 This 2004 Oscar nominee is a very short b / w film in Spanish . A young woman goes into a café , gets a coffee , and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments . All the patrons are motionless , like mannequins . One guy , however , is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning . There is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite , well , surprising . The people , the place , everything looks quite ordinary . And like the musical piece " Bolero " , the thing keeps building until the climax . With its structure , theme , movement and wit , it is an 8 minute masterpiece .
1 A woman , Mujar ( Marta Belengur ) enters a restaurant one morning at & : 35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film , which I only saw by finding it on the DVD of the director / writer 's equally fascinating " Timecrimes " . It had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short . I 'm glad that I stumbled across it ( was n't aware it would be an extra when I rented the DVD ) and would n't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends.<br /><br />My Grade : A-
1 Good film . Tells a boyish fantasy story , telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . Or at least the feeling : that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . If you wanted to express love for someone you do n't know , how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ? Also it 's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life , of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats . What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . Are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting , see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ?
1 Splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix : mystery , thriller , musical . Briefly , we are allowed to tell about the story : a girl comes into a European Cafeteria and then ... Soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic . In a no time , no place way Vigalondo managed a delight in B / W by means of imagination and despite ( thanks to ) the tightest of budgets.<br /><br />Because of the unity of time - space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem ( almost a haiku ) . Spain , land of quick poetry in B / W ( ¿ remember the early Buñuel?).<br /><br />A must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the States .
1 The question is , can a movie this entertaining really be considered a " bad " movie ? My husband and I picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words " Vestron Pictures " on it ( Vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since I first acquired the legendary films " Suburbia " and " Class of 1984 " ) . We were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was . Your basic plot as is follows : Grange , this goombaesque thug from planet Earth , robs " the bank of the Moon " and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet ( I do n't even remember the planet 's name ) to mine for bauxite and other minerals . The " governor " of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor . Walker , a bounty hunter ( apparently one of only three on the whole planet ) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape , because there 's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they 'd have him to deal with . Then there 's the nameless " Colonel " , a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare . Much of the movie centers around " futuristic " car chases ( dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides ) with explosions galore . The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet , CA or one of those other dusty Inland Empire outposts . But what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands of the mid-80s . I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl , but it 's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack . I ca n't even remember the names of the bands ( they 're listed in the credits ) other than Exploding White Mice , because that was the only one I 'd heard of before I saw this movie , but I 'm definitely looking into them.<br /><br />Basically , the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends .
1 I watched the movie while recovering from major surgery . While I knew it was only a " B " film , a space western , I loved it . It may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non - the - less held my imagination and provided great escapism . Sadly our society has so much available , discounting small attempts is too easy . In the same way that I can enjoy a even a grade school performance of Shakespeare , I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake . I am a cop and found affinity with the retired LAPD . Dreams like his haunt me that I will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another 's life ( or my own ) . while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth did take out the bad guy ( predictable ) I needed a little happy romance where good can triumph . My world is really too cynical .
1 This movie is really not all that bad . But then again , this movie genre is right down my alley . Sure , the sets are cheap , but they really did decent with what they had . < br /><br />If you like cheap , futuristic , post - apocalyptic B movies , then you 'll love this one ! ! I sure did!<br /><br / >
1 It was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as World War II and Vietnam combined ; however , there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good ( or rather : bad ) as Pearl Harbor . It is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces , but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world.<br /><br />I'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great ( Youssef Chahine 's , for example , has a needless prologue with too many cuts and Shohei Imamura 's has a really bizarre ending ) or that the segments are in the right order ( Imamura 's , being the only one not referring directly to the Twin Towers , should open the film , not end it , Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu 's should be the last one instead , as it 's the most impressive one ) . But it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers.<br /><br />Consider Samira Makhmalbaf 's opening segment , in which an Afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in New York and unsuccessfully suggests a one - minute silence . Or Idrissa Ouedraogo 's part ( which features a bin Laden - double so much resembling the real one that you 'll be shocked when you see him , I promise ) , in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on Laden.<br /><br />There 's a surprisingly good ( and extremely angry ) segment by Ken Loach about a man from Chile talking about what he calls " our Tuesday September 11 " - that September 11 in 1973 when their elected president Allende was killed and Pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from Henry Kissinger and the CIA . This could have become a terrible effort in Anti - Americanism , but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with Inarritu 's ( mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen , sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the WTC and finally a collapsing tower , ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing ) and Amos Gitai 's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in Tel Aviv ( hard to recognize , but this one is a masterpiece of choreography).<br /><br />All these different segments ( I have n't mentioned yet Claude Lelouch 's about a deaf girl , Danis Tanovic 's about a demonstration of the Women of Srebrenica , Mira Nair 's - strange , but it takes an Indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to Western tastes - about a Muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and Sean Penn 's with Ernest Borgnine ( yes , Ernest Borgnine ) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine ) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget . I am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now . I hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies . But , alas , it 's far more probable it will be remembered as a one - film - only effort . And as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that do n't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience .
1 French production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of September 11.<br /><br />The film segments vary widely in content and quality . Two allude to U.S. complicity in terrorist acts ( in Chile against Allende , who died on September 11 , 1973 , depicted in the segment by British director Ken Loach ; and in Palestine by U.S .- backed Israelis , shown in the segment from Egyptian director Youssef Chahine ) . Two more recall other destructive acts ( a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv , shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan ; the Japanese " holy war " against the west in WW II , by Shohei Imamura).<br /><br />Ironies abound in several stories . Shadows that darken the New York City apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the World Trade towers telescope to the ground in Sean Penn 's piece , bringing the man momentary joy . But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone . In Mira Nair 's film , based on a real incident , a missing young man , also in New York City , the son of a Pakistani family , is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist , but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers.<br /><br />There are poignant moments dotted throughout . Loach has his exiled Chilean man quote St. Augustine , to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage : anger at the way things are , courage to change them . Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war . Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren , exiled in Iran , trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in New York . But they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp , where two men have fallen into a deep well , one killed , the other sustaining a broken leg . This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds . < br /><br />Idrissa Ouedraogo , from Burkina Faso , creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist , in order to get the $ 25 million U. S. reward . He tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans , for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes , while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute.<br /><br />It is Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( maker of " Amores Perros " ) who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment , one that , for the most part , shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds . Brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers , and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground . The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot , bearing a phrase first shown only in Arabic , then with a translation added : " Does God 's light guide us or blind us ? " ( In various languages with English subtitles ) Grade : 8/10 ( B+ ) . ( Seen on 10/31/04 ) . If you 'd like to read more of my reviews , send me a message for directions to my websites .
1 Given the nature and origin of the 11 filmakers it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards America . Probably the most ' anti ' segment comes from Ken Loach who is definitely not towing the British New Labour party line . Although those events of a year ago are shocking and painful to most Americans and most spectators who saw them unfold live through CNN etc . the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly . Should anybody be surprised that these 3000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the West gives to thousands Tutsi , Tamil , Bosnian , Chilean , Kurdish ( need we go on ) victims . If this was a ' wake - up ' call for the States then it is equally tragic that in the subsequent 12 months the Israel / Palestine impasse is further from a solution while George Bush Jnr . would rather wreak revenge than make the world a safer place . I think many of the contributors wonder where the idealism of the Founding Fathers went , and why America orignally built as a bastion of freedom , justice and tolerance now sees its self - interest paramount while the Third World wonders where the next drink , meal or bullet is coming from .
1 This collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea , and presents some great segments , but also some disappointing surprises . Based on the tragic event of the September 11th 2001 in the United States of America , eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the American tragedy . The result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the American people , but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people.<br /><br />Ken Loach ( UK ) presents the best segment , about the September 11th 1973 in Chile , when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the USA.<br /><br />The other excellent segments are the one of Youssef Chahine ( Egypt ) , showing the intolerance in the world , and the number of victims made by USA governments in different countries along the contemporary history ; and the one of Mira Nair ( India ) , showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistanis family , whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in USA , when he was indeed a hero.<br /><br />Some segments are beautiful : Samira Makhmalbaf ( Iran ) shows the innocent Afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs , while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world ; the romantic Claude Lelouch ( France ) shows the life of a couple in New York nearby the WTC ; Danis Tanovic ( Bosnia - Herzegovina ) shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows ; Sean Penn is very poetic , showing that life goes on ; and Shohei Imamura 's story is probably the most impressive , showing that there is no Holy War but sadness and disgrace.<br /><br />The segment of Idrissa Quedraogo ( Birkina Faso ) is very naive , but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this African nation.<br /><br />The segment of Amos Gital ( Israel ) is very boring and manipulative , showing more violence and terrorism.<br /><br />The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing , horrible , without any inspiration and certainly the worst one.<br /><br />My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " 11 de Setembro " ( " September 11 " )
1 As you may know , the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes , 9 seconds and one frame . We have here : - Samira Makhmalbaf ( Iran ) : what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing ? Well , nothing . A great lesson . - Claude Lelouch ( France ) : a weak plot with a great cinematography ... Just imagine a deaf woman living by the WTC who sees without understanding it that her dog barks ... Well just see it . - Youssef Chahine ( Egypt ) : the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion ... For everyone : for an us soldier who died ten years ago , for the people in the Wtc but also for a palestinian suicide - terrorist . Maybe the less tender movie towards the us . - Danis Tanovic ( bosnia hrzgovia ) : good images , makes us travel , for sure ... Not a very good plot . Idrissa Oudraogo ( Burkina Faso ) : from one of the poorest country in the world , a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture Osama Bin Laden ... And they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is . Ken Loach ( uk ) : September 11 , 1973 , The Chile entered in a twenty - years long bloody dictature . Thousands of death , tortures : all that was offered to Chile by Henry Kissinger and the CIA , and knowing this changes very much your point of view ! I guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters ! Loach forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the WTC was built ! - Alejandro Gonzalez inarritu ( Mexico ) : impressing images that we all know too well , and a lot of black screens . I did n't get this one very much , it is more an artist video ( to show in an exhibition ) than a movie . - Amos Gitaï ( Israël ) : an absurd ballet of policemen , journalists , etc . , around a burning car in Jerusalem . Very well done . - Mira Nair ( India ) : about the anti - islamic feeling that followed september the 11th . Very good actualy . - Sean Penn ( us ) : a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten , the WTC did have a huge shadow , and some places now have a daylight they never had . - Shohei Imamura ( Japan ) : a different one . Here there is not even one word about the WTC , and the action takes place at the end of WWII . It has only one message : no war is holy . This short movie gives very deep feelings , but the director aparently would have done better with more than 11 minutes . --- so --- A great movie , a great attempt to take the world 's temperature . I love it .
1 Though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience . There were some who , in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings , took this to be anti - American . I do n't think that s the case , even though some parts might be taken that way if you do n't look behind the obvious . Ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion , sympathy and feelings about what happened . These are stories of people who 's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a Tuesday in September.<br /><br />As I said this film will move you , probably to tears . Its not always easy to watch , for example the film from Mexico is little more than a black screen with sound , but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low . If you can be strong you really should see this film . It will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you ...
1 I saw this series when it world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival . I liked the idea behind the film , where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911 . These directors never met before until the project was complete , and they saw how it looked all together . WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! All the pieces were very powerful , and some were controversial . If you are an American , then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti - american . However , i know a few Americans who enjoyed these series . The piece that i found the best was the one from India . It was about how a muslim family , living in the States , had 2 sons , and one of them was missing . The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing . It captures the mom 's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well , that it brought tears to my eyes . In the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers . This was a true story , and that was what made it so real . There were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces , and the African piece was one of the best . It was humourous yet just as powerful as the others . A must see for everyone , and hopefully America will unban this , and let it play in their country .
1 Eleven different Film Makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack . This is one of the best effort you will see in any Film . Films like this are rarely made and appreciated . This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC . Here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique.<br /><br />There is the story from Samira Makhmalbaf ( Iran ) where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for the attacks from America . There a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about Innocent People being killed in WTC massacre . Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine ( Egypt ) where a Film Maker comes across face - to - face conversation with a Dead Soldier in the WTC attack and a Dead Hard Core Terrorist who was involved in WTC attack . Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo ( Burkina Faso ) where a group of Five Innocent children 's sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from America . Then we see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu ( Mexico ) where you see a Black Screen and slowly you see the real footage of WTC buildings coming down . And the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives . The other most important story is from Mira Nair ( India ) where a mother is struggling to get respect for her Dead Son whose name is falsely trapped in WTC massacre ! After September 11 attack , Our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world .. First is World Trade Centre and the second is Osama ! This film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it.<br /><br />I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of Home DVD Collection . Definitely worth every penny you spend . But please do n't expect anything more apart from Films in this DVD . There is of course Filmographies of the Film Makers but No Extra Features .
1 I first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct Trio Channel a few years ago , and recently watched it again -- sans commercials -- on Sundance . I was impressed the first time , and found it even more engaging on second viewing . Yes , some of the segments are far from perfect -- Amos Gitai 's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb -- but taken collectively , 11 09 01 is a total success . Best of show : Shohei Imamura 's amazing final segment , which contemporary critics such as the thick - witted Mick LaSalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on ' the terrorists ' , but now stands revealed as a masterful anti - war polemic ; Samira Makhmalbaf 's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of Afghanistan ; and Idrissa Ouedraogo 's amusing children 's crusade for Osama Bin Laden -- a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the REAL Osama . Youssef Chahine 's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and the CIA , and though Sean Penn 's character study seems out of place , it 's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film - making . All in all , essential viewing , and a darn sight better than Oliver Stone 's reactionary World Trade Center .
1 This document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the United States thought about the September 11th attacks . This film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on U.S. soil . The aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives . I believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point . It also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks . And some of the pieces are actually funny , but not abusively so . This film came highly recommended to me , and I pass on the same feeling .
1 First of all I 've got to give it to the people that got this thing together . 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts . It 's a shame , although not surprising , that the movie was banned in the US.<br /><br />That being said I think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments . The movie starts up with the Iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of Majid Majidi 's work ( the absolutely beautiful " heaven 's children " and " the color of paradise " ) . Much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afgan refugees in Iran . Absolutely beautiful clip . Same goes for Sean Penn 's clip which is superb as well . But just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal . Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut - wrenching " Amores perros " he does it as brutal as he can . Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background . Those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes , those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families , those who were angry .... and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers . A very hard clip to watch and one that you wo n't forget.<br /><br />Some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for Americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as " you 're not the only ones that are suffering " . In particular the Egyptian and British clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the US has caused to other people.<br /><br />I will also make a special mention to the clips from Bosnia - Herzegovina , France , India and Japan ( although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't).<br /><br />However , not all the clips are great and I make a special mention on the clip from Israel which , in my opinion , is extremely weak . While the idea was good ( a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in New York is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to ) the realization is terrible . The clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air - time at all costs , a guy saying he 's a witness and hoping that he can go on TV , and soldiers and paramedics shouting just " because " . The clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation.<br /><br />If you happen to have the chance to see it then you should , that is , unless you 're a conservative in which case you 'd better stay out as you might get offended . But if you 're not then you might learn how many of us outside the US lived through 9/11 .
1 This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world . The documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts , the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme ( very minor in some cases ) . Some of the segements are weak while others are very strong ; some are political , some are not ; some are solely about 9/11 , some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings , emotions and tragedies that are universal ; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic ) . This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful.<br /><br />This is a very controversial film , especially for conservative Americans . I think two segments might really tick off the right wingers ( one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits ; another from UK which recounts the US - backed overthrow of Chile on Sept 11 , 1973 , which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities ) . The segment from Mexico was the most powerful , recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion ( you have to see it to believe it).<br /><br />Even though the final product is uneven , with some segments being almost " pointless " , I still recommend this . It 's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place ( some weak , some very powerful ; ) . I 'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored ( Mexico segment , UK segment , Japan segment , Egypt segment ) .
1 i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france , as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous ; the collection works as intended : it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions , working as an intellectual hommage , never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee - jerk reactionism.<br /><br />there have been many allegations made that the film is anti - american : while i can not speak for everyone in this regard , i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue . people make much noise about the egyptian segment , by Chahine , because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are " fair targets " for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack , but this ignores much else in the piece : several perspectives are discussed , no one being held up as the truth , and critics -- if they even saw the piece -- seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue , and the director 's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy.<br /><br />pretty much all of the films are beautiful , thoughtful & inspiring , in particular the brilliant work by Mahkmalbaf , Tanovic , Loach & Inarritu . Nair , good as usual , effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti - islam hysteria that swept -- and still sweeps -- the states . i did find Gitai 's piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it 's critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism , and Penn 's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes , though i had expected to like it . Borgnine is very good and brave in it . SPOILER WARNING : one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character ; my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what , because light floods his room , keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize . again this is a sort of impressionistic piece , for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man 's flat , then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash , not light , flooding through his window .
1 A patchwork about 911 . The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic , sometimes boring ( the first one , for example ) , sometimes used to say to Americans " we have had more deaths than you , and you supported the murderers " , sometimes really weird ( but highly symbolic and interesting ) . I really loved the Claude Lelouch ( personal live of a couple in New - York , showing that our day - to - day " problems " are unimportant ) , Shoei Imamura ( bizarre , strongly anti - wars in general ) , and Idrissa Ouedraogo ( funny , typical African optimism despite terrible day to day misery ) , and Youssef Chahine ( an Egyptian intellectual , pro - peace , having moral difficulties to accept the U.S. policy towards Arab countries ) I am really pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie . It shows that we ( or they ? I am still Belgian , but living in Texas for 12 years ) are still interested by other cultures , and able to question past and present actions of our government , like we should in a democracy .
1 Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces ( I found only the Egyptian one disappointing ) . Stragely , all but the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9 - 11 : the Afghan refugees , deaf people , Palestinians , the widows of Srebrenica , AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa , Pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath , suicide bombings in Israel , paranoia - hit and state - persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA , old people living alone , and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers . This might say something sad about the limits of empathy , in both ways : the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies , while they effectively do the same with their short films.<br /><br />Surprising myself , I found Sean Penn 's piece one of the very best in the collection , and * * * SPOILER AHEAD * * * I also guess his portrayal of Ernest Borgnine as a half - crazy old man vegetating in a New York flat experiencing his widow life 's happiest moment when the Sun shines through his window after the WTC " collapsed out of light 's way " , I guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general American audience would see it .
1 I just recently watched this on the Sundance channel . The idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers , illustrious in their own country , to make short films , eleven of them , all in one film , concentrating on just one subject : September 11.<br /><br />From wacthing this movie I could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a film from Iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with September 11 which they fail to realize until later.<br /><br />The Second Film from France involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the T.V plays.<br /><br />The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9/11 but bombings in other places.<br /><br />The next comes from Bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes they must march for them.<br /><br />The next from a country in Africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be Bin Ladin.<br /><br />The next comes from Mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day.<br /><br />The next from Israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks.<br /><br />There are other films that I ca n't remember at the moment but all of them are powerful . It will bring back your emotions from that day.<br /><br />10/10
1 This is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant . Gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes , 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice ; each short exploring the global reverberations of 9/11 . Without using any spoilers , I would say that Ken Loach 's piece is the jewel in the crown , and Mira Nair 's short ( segment " India " ) , based on a true story , deserves to be made into a full feature film . One also realizes , while watching his short , why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today  he simply is a master of the medium , who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter . Unfortunately , not all 11 parts are made as well . Youssef Chahine , in his segment " Egypt " , assumes the Arab stance of the self - inflicted collective guilt , which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one . He fails miserably . Chahine 's short is poorly written and badly executed , at least enough to stand out amongst other , superior chapters of the film . Despite the imbalance in quality , I would still give the film 7/10 for concept , if not for execution .
1 This is the greatest film I saw in 2002 , whereas I 'm used to mainstream movies . It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films . From the technical info ( the chosen directors ) , I feared it would have an anti - American basis , but ... it 's a kind of ( 11 times ) personal tribute.<br /><br />The weakest point comes from Y. Chahine : he does not manage to " swallow his pride " and considers this event as a well - merited punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the movie , but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece . The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual - art film ... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant . The 9 others are perfect ( K. Loach , S. Penn , S. Makhmalbaf , ... ) or nearly perfect ( C. Lelouch ) and made me either smile , or cry or even left me stunned . I still do n't know if S. Imamura 's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe , but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply ' makes it ' .
1 First of all , I do n't understand why some people find this movie so anti - american . Sure , there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly , like at the segments of Youssef Chahine , Ken Loach and , to a certain extent , Mira Nair . But come on , they are n't naive accusations ; instead , they are based on real and documented facts , and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this , for example.<br /><br />But returning to the film itself , what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it . We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event ; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day ; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this , with dignity or frustration ; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.<br /><br />All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th . Thus , what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks , and this may make some people infuriated ; but this is the world where we live , and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies , regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.<br /><br />Finally , I think it 's a shame that there is n't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America . It 's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened , and this movie could give some clues to them . This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future , and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today .
1 the movie is great , like every other international project that includes strong impressions . three of them ( israel , bosnia and egypt ) should 've been cut out . especially bosnian clip , which is pathetic beyond all reason , and does n't contain a single original thought or element on it 's own . everything else is really great , unrecognizable for most of americans , known for the rest of the world . unfortunately , clips speak about misery of the people all over the world . and , as i see it , there are so many of those who wo n't give a damn about it ... <br /><br />top 5 : 1 . loach 2 . penn 3 . inarritu 4 . lalouche 5 . imamura
1 First than anything , I 'm not going to praise Iñarritu 's short film , even I 'm Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood.<br /><br />In another hand , I see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite ( and not so ) short films ; but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation , and maybe it will not be so pleasant for American people . ( Even if that was not the main purpose of the producers ) < br /><br />What i 'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that WASP people went through because the terrorist attack on September 11th , but the suffering of the Other people.<br /><br />Do you need proofs about what i 'm saying ? Look , in the Bosnia short film , the message is : " You cry because of the people who died in the Towers , but we ( The Others = East Europeans ) are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you".<br /><br />Even though the Burkina Fasso story is more in comedy , there is a the same thought : " You are angry because Osama Bin Laden punched you in an evil way , but we ( The Others = Africans ) should be more angry , because our people is dying of hunger , poverty and AIDS long time ago , and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you".<br /><br />Look now at the Sean Penn short : The fall of the Twin Towers makes happy to a lonely ( and alienated ) man . So the message is that the Power and the Greed ( symbolized by the Towers ) must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom ? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an American . There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive.<br /><br />Well , the Ken Loach ( very know because his anti - capitalism ideology ) is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point : " You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces , but we ( The Others = Latin Americans ) suffered at a similar date something worst , and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you".<br /><br />It is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to Americans : " You see now , America ? You are not the only that have become victim of the world violence , you are not alone in your pain and by the way , we ( the Others = the Non Americans ) have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago ; so , we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and by the way , we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine " Only the Mexican and the French short films showed some compassion and sympathy for American people ; the others are like a slap on the face for the American State , that is not equal to American People .
1 A great idea : 11 stories about 11 September . 11 directors from different countries with different results . Ken Loach talking about an immigrant ( as usual ) is just brilliant ( as usual ) . The Frenchman does a very good job also , while the Burkina Faso film was a nice surprise . However , the Israel film was a bit boring , and the Mexican guy , well , he should quit directing and work in a Mexican restaurant . 8/10
1 < br /><br />Everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors . That is to say that what might be number one priority for people like Bush , Blair and Company , may not be so for a great many other people , ordinary people . From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened , with the result the children are not impressed , as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in New York , USA , wherever that is , this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess . < br /><br />Whereas , obviously , the attack on the WTC was a dastardly event by any yardstick , one does get the impression that both politicians and TV cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces . Would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on Lagos , say , or Djakarta , say , or even on Rio de Janeiro , say ? I rather think not . News seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen : much more TV time is given to an earthquake in Italy , say , than one ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia , say . Greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster . < br /><br />This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective - or , perhaps I should say , some of the pieces do , as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story , his own translated perspective , such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits , but individually for each eleven - minute segment . < br /><br />In no way should one deduce that this is an anti - American film : that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments . However , it is not pro - American either . The eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the WTC attack has to be seen in perspective from different view - points . Only then will such people as George Bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on . < br /><br />Clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine I have been harbouring for two years now : America has not learnt the lesson . And the lesson is that the USA has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force . Instead of learning that the USA can not continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere , its political leaders , aided and abetted by Blair ( and even Aznar ) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant , which is not doing any good to anyone in Afghanistan or Irak at present , let alone much elsewhere . The White House mentality is totally rejectable : the US and UK invaded Irak and caused all the chaos , and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the UN and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil . < br /><br />Radical stances adopted by the US ( or even Israel ) is only going to be met by radical stances from Islamic people , who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism , if only to cover up their own macho uselessness , i.e. , stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground . < br /><br />The world is in a terrible mess , fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives . This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture .
1 The idea 's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the American Policies , not neccessarily the United States itself . It shows what most of the people around the world think about America and what the Americans do nt know about themselves . 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give US viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie .
1 Chang Cheh 's " Shaolin Temple " might very well be the highwater mark of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film cycle . This rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who 's who of the Shaw stable . Though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual , it is Cheh 's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable . The sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every frame . Not unlike William Keighley 's paean to the fabled Fighting 69th in that same self titled film or John Ford 's salute to West Point in " The Long Gray Line , " Cheh 's " Shaolin Temple " is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style.<br /><br />The cultural correlation I am tempted to make , is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo . Watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the Alamo . At the end of the film , you too might be tempted to call out , Remember the Shaolin Temple !
1 The Only Kung Fu Epic worth watching . The best training ever . The main character spending a hundred day 's on his knees outside the shaolin temple show how desperate he is to learn kung fu to fight the manchu dogs who have taken over china .
1 An entertaining kung fu film , with acting , plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky . All of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists . Alexander Fu - Sheng 's proto - Jackie Chan comedy antics are fun to watch , and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills . For me , the film 's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast -- at times , things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots , and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed - out as one might wish.<br /><br />But a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action , and Shaolin Temple definitely delivers on that count . The film climaxes with a high - bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent.<br /><br />Overall , Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low - budget kung fu movie . Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li film , but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre . My rating : 8/10.<br /><br />Misc notes : The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was ( predictably ) poorly dubbed , and lacked full cast & crew credits .
1 This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen . If you know the Real World and the people from those shows , this movie will be top notch , if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you wo n't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show .
1 Hilarious film . I saw this film at the 2002 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival , and laughed from start to finish . The acting was subtle but very funny . I 'm not entirely certain about " The Real World " influence , we do n't get that here , but the film holds up without the understanding of that show . Heather B steals every scene she appears in , most notably when acting with her seldom talkative red co - star . Highly recommended . I 'd love to see this released on Video / DVD some time in the future .
1 If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie . If you are young or old then you will love this movie , hell even my mom liked it.<br /><br />Great Camp ! ! !
1 Well , I am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on DVD . When that will happen , I do n't know , but I will grab it when it 's released.<br /><br />In my humble opinion , this is Errol Flynn 's most entertaining film , especially when " Gentleman Jim " Corbett 's ring career begins in the film . Then it goes from a good film to a great one.<br /><br />Few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as Flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that . Reportedly , this was Flynn 's favorite role and I believe that . You can just sense how much fun he was having here . Ward Bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan . Bond , too , was never better.<br /><br />There is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done , too . Corbett 's family is fun to watch , too , as they carry on in the stands during Jim 's matches . Out of the arena , Corbett 's family 's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.<br /><br />And speaking of the conclusion , Sullivan 's speech to Corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film . Some mean - spirited critics ( Variety , for example ) did n't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized , like it or not . And , in this case , it made for a nice story and nice ending . ( In real life , Corbett was a very soft - spoken true gentleman , not anything like Flynn 's portrayal , but Flynn still make him a good guy.)<br /><br />This is one of the more entertaining classic films I have ever watched and I eagerly wait for the DVD .
1 This film enhanced my opinion of Errol Flynn . While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir - faire and sprezzatura ( to throw in a couple of high - falutin ' European terms ! ) , this film gives him an opportunity to stretch ( albeit only slightly ) as an actor , as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match . The supporting cast is excellent ; everyone seems well - chosen for their roles.<br /><br />The story moves briskly and , while not particularly profound ( it misses , perhaps intentionally , the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time ) , it certainly entertains and satisfies . From what I know of Jim Corbett , the story is also reasonably faithful to history . I also really liked the great depictions of 1880s San Francisco . All in all , there 's little not to like about this film ... very well worth the time to watch it .
1 James J. Corbett 's autobiography " The Roar of the Crowd " was the starting point of this lively and well - remembered fictionalized biography . The author was heavyweight champion of the world , succeeding John L. Sullivan , before the turn of the century . The events of the narrative depict Corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time , when he was considered merely the son of Irish immigrants , a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone . It took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen - time to prove his compeers were wrong . He is an bank teller when the film opens , but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the well - to - do . He falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl , with whom he always seems to be quarreling , and he lives at home with a brawling clan of Corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others . When he defeats the club 's best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him , he finally decides to become famous by fighting . he sets out on the road with his friend , who acts as manager and trainer , and despite a few near setbacks , he wins all his bouts and attracts attention . Coming home to pursue his girl again , he contrives to annoy the Boston Strongboy , mighty John L. Sullivan , who enters bars and claims he can " lick any man in the world " . Few believe he can win a bout against Sullivan , but Corbett , dubbed " Gentleman Jim " for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving , dancing out of range , and negating the furious Sullivan 's power . The film 's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten Sullivan comes to congratulate Corbett . The new champion rises to the moment , tells Sullivan a few years before it might have been different , and shows him nothing but admiration and respect . He gets his girl as a result of his two performances , but by the end of the film , as they visit his s parents , his manager is able to tell the world , " The Corbetts are at it again " . The films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy . The script was written by veteran Horace McCoy and Vincent Lawrence from the Corbett novel . Sidney Hickox did the cinematography , with period set decorations by Clarence Steensen and art direction by Ted Smith . Heinz Roemheld did the music and Milo Anderson the gowns . The film was ably directed by action - film specialist Raoul Walsh . Flynn also liked working with Walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often , Michael Curtiz . Among the cast , were Ward Bond as John L. Sullivan , in one of his best performances lovely Alexis Smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl Corbett loves and a very able Errol Flynn as Corbett , a young man he seemed to relish playing -- he later said it was his favorite role from the period ... Jack Carson was his manager , Alan Hale his charismatic father , John Loder a rich foe , with William Frawley , Minor Watson , Madeleine LeBeau , Rhys Williams , Arthur Shields , Dorothy Vaughn and Mike Mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings . It is hard to say enough about the logic and light - hearted fun this movie 's makers have generated ; it is one of the best - liked of all sports biography films , and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well .
1 Some saying about ' The Play is the Most Important Thing ' , or something like that , is attributed to that old Bard of Avon , himself , William Shakewspeare . if it was n't old Will , it may well have been our own , super - veteran film Director , Mr. Raoul Walsh . There are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis . None are more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM(Warner Brothers , 1942).<br /><br />The Film also racks up another award , being named as Errol Flynn 's favourite of his own starring vehicles . It clearly gives on screen evidence that would easily lead viewers sitting in the darkened theatre , or viewing it on their home TV or DVD , to conclude same.<br /><br />To be sure , the story is a semi - serious Biopic , which takes a portion of factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying , albeit somewhat fictionalized(what Biopic isn't?)occurrences.<br /><br />The casting is excellent , as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our lead , Mr. Errol Flynn . Though not a Swashbuckler , a Western or a War Picture , this GENTLEMAN JIM is perhaps the starring role that was the best fit for the rugged Australian.<br /><br />Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in either 1928 or 1932 . His training and skills in the ' sweet science'are clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the " Big Fight " for the World 's Heavyweight Boxing Championship with the great John L.Sullivan , Himself.(played in expert fashion by Ward Bond ) The cast reads like a duty roster of Warner Brothers ' resident supporting players . It features Alan Hale as Jim Corbet 's father , a Livery Wagon operator*. His two brothers are Harry and George ( Pat Flaherty and James Flavin ) , the two ' blue collar ' men of the family , their occupations being stated as being ' Longshormen'.<br /><br />The great Jack Carson does his usual masterful serio - comic performance in support as Jim Corbett 's friend and fellow bank teller . The rest of those we can both recognize and remember are : John Loder , William Frawley , Madeleine LeBeau , Minor Watson , Rhys Williams , Arthur Shields , Dorothy Vaughn to name but a few.<br /><br />Director Walsh also used a number of Pro Wrestlers in roles of various Boxers . Hence we have Ed " Strangler " Lewis and an unknown Grappler * are featured as the 2 waterfront pugs in the opening scenes . Others were Sammy Stein , Mike Mazurki(ever hear of him?)and " Wee Willie " Davis . These guys had a powerful , yet unpolished look about them that the old Pier 9 brawlers would have possessed.<br /><br />We have n't forgotten Leading Lady , Alexis Smith . She is powerful in her characterization of an " independent " woman , yet maintains enough true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes . She displays quite a range in her part as poor little rich girl , Victoria Lodge.<br /><br />With all these ingredients at hand , the trick is how to mix the elements in proper proportions to give it the ' just right ' blend . Well , Director Walsh does so with a reckless abandon . Because he is looking for , above all , a great film . His treatment shows all of the skills he had honed to a fine tuning starting with his days as a player with D.W. Griffith . Mr. Walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period , the 1890 's . * * * Mr. Walsh 's direction moves through the script at a fairly fast clip , breaking up the exposition scenes with a humorous punch - line , " the Corbetts are at it again ! " Hence , he is able to maintain a light , even humorous touch to a story which could become too drab and serious.<br /><br />Furthermore , in an almost unnoticed element , Brother Walsh gives us an authentic look of a San Francisco of the 1890 's . And as a further example of his fondness for that period , he creates wide , dynamic images of the historic Prize Fights . There is a vibrant , joyful mood conveyed in those Boxing scenes . As a crowning glory to this great , perhaps underrated film , Director Walsh gave the image a look as if it were an illustration from The Police Gazette , which covered such events in those " Old Days".<br /><br />But there 's just one thing to remember before viewing . If it is for the first time , or if your seeing it once more:<br /><br />"THE CORBETS ARE AT IT AGAIN!!" < br /><br / > * In my humble opinion as a historian of both Film and Pro Wrestling , it looks like Tor Johnson , who years later was a favourite of Director Ed Wood's.<br /><br / > * * A ' Livery ' is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle for hire for local city transportation.<br /><br / > * * * It 's true . Mr. Raoul Walsh was a Griffith Veteran Player . He was the actor to portray John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION(1915).<br /><br / > * * * * Being born in 1887 , Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890 's and of the Sullivan - Corbett Championship Bout and what it meant to the Sporting Life in the America of those days .
1 Flynn , known mostly for his swashbuckling roles ( and his bedroom antics ! ) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully . Playing real - life boxing champ Jim Corbett , Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist , all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith . He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare - knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men ( and a dog ! ) including a prominent judge . The next day , he gets a chance , via Smith , to gain entrance to the judge 's private club . He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club 's resident boxer . His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers , up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan ( Bond . ) Flynn is downright magical here . He is the epitome of charm , charisma and appeal in this role . He looks terrific ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit ) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork ( impressively ! ) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally . Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn . At this stage , he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation ( he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time ) and she does so admirably . She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude , yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell . Bond is incredibly burly , brawny and towering , yet tender when the script calls for it . Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson . Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn 's manager . The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynn 's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types . The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed . A few of the sets are amazingly presented . Some of Smith 's gowns border on the garish , but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well . It 's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing , but it 's also so much more . Some of it ( like the character traits shown by Flynn ) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes , but a lot of it is authentic ( like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes . ) One line is particularly memorable : " I believe you like me more than I like you , but it 's entirely possible that I love you more than you love me . " It 's classic romantic dialogue ( and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well . )
1 Gentleman Jim not really a boxing film . It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett . But having said that , the boxing scenes are a real eye - opener to the modern viewer . There are no 12 round , points decisions here.<br /><br />Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title . Flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable Corbett . His opponent John Sullivan is still better however , a bruiser of the old school played by Ward Bond.<br /><br />The theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance . Corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as Gentleman Jim . Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment . He is a liar and an egotist . Sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character.<br /><br />There is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all . And Errol Flynn gets the girl .
1 Loosely based on the James J Corbett biography " The Roar Of The Crowd " , Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was Corbett , but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s.<br /><br />The story follows Corbett { a perfectly casted Errol Flynn } from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico , thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world , John L Sullivan { beefcake personified delightfully by Ward Bond}. Not all the fights are in the ring tho , and it 's all the spin off vignettes in Corbett 's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture . There are class issues to overcome here { perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two } , and Corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers , but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does . Along with the quite wonderful Corbett family , and all their stoic humorous support , Corbett 's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous , yet as brash and as bold as he is , he is a very likable character , and it 's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of Gentleman Jim.<br /><br />The film never sags for one moment , and it 's a testament to director Raoul Walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight , the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained , not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture { thank you Alexis Smith}. The fight sequences stand up really well , and they perfectly show just how Corbett became the champ he was , his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history . As the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context , and it 's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner , and as far as this viewer goes .............. it will do for me to be sure to be sure , 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture .
1 I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling " Gentleman Jim " the best boxing movie ever made . That is the Robert Wise / Paul Newman flick " Somebody Up There Likes Me . " That movie might be number 1 , but " Gentleman Jim " is a close number 2.<br /><br />The movie does n't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett , it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition . In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare - knuckle rules to the more " gentlemanly " days of the gloved , Marquis of Queensbury rules . And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />"Gentleman Jim " is not a realistic look at those days . It is romanticized and , yes , even a bit hokey at times . But always delightfully so . Errol Flynn is perfect as the " Gentleman " Jim who really is n't a " gentleman " at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family . Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love / hate relationship ( and we all know it is , of course , love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of " Gentleman Jim " the great John L Sullivan ( whose famous line was NOT " I can lick any man in the world " of course ... romanticism again ) hands over his belt to Corbett . This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made . Realistic ? No . But wonderful . Hey , if you want realism watch " Raging Bull " instead . That is a much more realistic boxing movie . But " Gentleman Jim " is a lot more fun .
1 This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood . What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history . What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day . In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated . But getting back to the movie , all the performances were excellent . Alexis Smith was beautiful . Indeed , she looked like Nicole Kidman . And although it 's a period piece , the story withstands the test of time ; it has not gone stale . Ward Bond 's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic , well - staged and highly effective . That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must .
1 If you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer James Corbett , then this is probably not the film for you . The famed boxer receives a 1940s " Hollywood - ization " of his life -- making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life . However , because the performances were so good ( particularly by Errol Flynn ) and the script so likable , the film 's embellishments can be forgiven.<br /><br />Errol Flynn plays Gay Nineties - era boxer James " Gentleman Jim " Corbett -- a man who became world boxing champ in 1892 . The film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against John L. Sullivan . However , while it could have focused mostly on the matches , most are rather brief in the film ( except for the final title match ) and the emphasis is on Corbett 's brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by Alexis Smith . Throughout the film , there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors ( such as the perennial supporting actor in Flynn films , Alan Hale ) and the writing really helped bring these people alive.<br /><br />What is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of Flynn as a boxer . While a few of the shots are of doubles , almost all the boxing scenes are of Flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist . This was a nice departure for Flynn , who generally played " pretty boy " roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was . To find out more about this , try reading a biography of him -- he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to Hollywood.<br /><br />Now as for the REAL James Corbett , read on if you are n't afraid of finding out how the movie is n't accurate . First , Corbett was NOT a poor guy coming from a poor family , but was college educated and bright . Second , while he DID get Alexis Smith at the end of the film , they also divorced a few years later . Third , the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between Sullivan and Corbett was probably the best part of the film , Sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened -- in reality , Sullivan was more the egomaniac and Corbett was not the fat - headed guy they portrayed in the film -- though it made for a lovely film .
1 James J. Corbett , heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897 , turned out to be Errol Flynn 's favorite role . Possibly because he did n't have to wield a sword or be in a western . He grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and could n't understand why people liked him in them . It is an enjoyable film , but hardly does tell the real story of James J. Corbett.<br /><br />As portrayed Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division , a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win . He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown . He was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him . Of course that was not shown on the screen . The character that Alexis Smith plays , the banker 's daughter who falls for him , has no basis in reality . Corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives.<br /><br />Also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy . His father in a moment of depression , probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons , shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself . The murder / suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that Alan Hale presided over.<br /><br />One thing though that I did like about Gentleman Jim . Ward Bond got the career role of his life in playing John L. Sullivan . Director Raoul Walsh got a great performance out of Bond as the blustering , but lovable Sullivan . Even given some of Sullivan 's bad points that do n't make it to the screen like rabid racism , Bond 's portrayal is the quintessential John L. and the best thing about Gentleman Jim.<br /><br />Speaking of racism , one thing that should have been told was the fact that Sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet Peter Jackson who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time . I say probably because as a challenger Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw . That fight more than any other created a demand for a Sullivan - Corbett title match . Of course when Corbett was champion he refused to give Jackson a title shot . Maybe he did n't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day.<br /><br />Gentleman Jim is not Jim Corbett 's story , it is a movie of Errol Flynn playing at being James J. Corbett . But Corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved Flynn 's portrayal of his life . It 's as he would have liked to have been remembered .
1 Errol Flynn 's greatest movie , not just a sports movie with a wonder last 5 minutes where Ward Bond shines . Do n't miss it just because you think its an old movie . Its a classic that could be easily missed . Do yourself a favour and do n't .
1 Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim . I agree with all the assessments that make this among Errol Flynn 's greatest outings in a career of great outings . I would think this role playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as . Flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life . The extra thing I wanted to point out is notice the great montages , transitions , and still inserts that punctuate the film . Although the director was Raoul Walsh , a frequent collaborator with Flynn , with cinematographer Sid Hickox , the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named Don Siegel . I never knew Siegel went that far back but he 's listed right in the credits . He would go on to a great career as action director himself .
1 Excellent Warner Bros effort starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances . It 's often cited as his best , and I ca n't really judge fully until I have seen his " Dawn Patrol " . However , his work in " They Died With Their Boots On " takes some beating . I 'm a big Flynn fan ( he 's my favourite actor after James Mason -- it also helps that he 's an Aussie ) and I think he 's just marvellous , a great screen presence and also a great actor . He is the centrepiece of " Gentleman Jim " as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork , but he is also backed up by a literate , warm and funny script , and Raoul Walsh 's direction . Every Walsh film I have seen never loses a beat of it 's pace , he truly was a born film - maker . Walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully , as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant , great final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn . Add to that great production values ( the " Gay Nineties " never looked better ! ) and a lovely supporting cast and it 's pretty much perfect entertainment . Alan Hale usually played Flynn 's sidekick , but here is his father , and it still all works . Alexis Smith is Flynn 's love interest . The pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other .
1 In late 1800s San Francisco , poor well - dressed Errol Flynn ( as James J. Corbett ) works at a bank , and enjoys attending local " fights " ( boxing ) with co - worker and drinking buddy Jack Carson ( as Walter Lowrie ) . One day , pretty Alexis Smith ( as Victoria Ware ) walks into the " Comstock Bank " , where Mr. Flynn works . Flynn is so taken with Ms. Smith 's elegant beauty , he offers to carry her withdrawal purse . Smith is secretly taken with the handsome Flynn , but is put off by his brashness.<br /><br />Flynn 's good deed ( actually , pick - up attempt ) gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty " Olympic Club " , which conveniently includes a gymnasium ( with boxing equipment ) . However , Flynn 's presumptuous manner , and practical joking ( he tickles men on the parallel bars ) irritates " Club " members . When an English boxing champ visits the club , members endeavor to get Flynn to fight the man . They are hopeful Flynn will resign , humiliated by his defeat - but , Flynn wins ! < br /><br />First time producer Robert Buckner puts together a nice package for Warner Brothers , and director Raoul Walsh . Mr. Buckner was , certainly , basking in the success of his contribution ( screenplay ) to the studio 's brilliant " Yankee Doodle Dandy " . Unfortunately , this story is positively ludicrous . There was a " Gentleman Jim " - this story is supposedly the filming of the real James J. Corbett 's autobiography " The Roar of the Crowd " - but , this movie must be significantly fictionalized.<br /><br />Flynn is a very appealing leading man ; he maneuvers the script lightly , and should have been recognized , by the early 1940s , as an excellent actor . Many of Flynn 's characterizations were ( are ? ) overlooked as great performances , and this is one of them . Smith does well as his feminine interest , deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer . Director Walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant . The supporting cast is a treasure trove , from boisterous Alan Hale ( as Pat Corbett ) to walk - on Lon McCallister ( " Paging Mr. Corbett").<br /><br / > * * * * * * * * Gentleman Jim ( 1942 ) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn , Alexis Smith , Alan Hale
1 Errol Flynn is " Gentleman Jim " in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett , known as the man who beat John L. Sullivan . Directed with a light hand by Flynn 's good friend , Raoul Walsh , the film also stars Alexis Smith , Jack Carson , Alan Hale Sr . , William Frawley and Ward Bond . Flynn plays an ambitious , egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive Olympic Club in San Francisco in the late 1800s . Though good - natured , the fact that he is a " shanty Irishman " and a social climber builds resentment in Olympic Club members ; most of them ca n't wait to see him lose a fight , and they bet against him . Despite this , he rises to fame , even working as an actor . Finally he gets the chance he 's been waiting for , a match with the world champion , John L. Sullivan ( Ward Bond ) . Sullivan demands a $ 10,000 deposit to insure that Corbett will appear to fight for the $ 25,000 purse . Corbett and his manager ( Frawley ) despair of getting the money . However , help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining film , and Jim Corbett is an excellent role for Flynn , who himself was a professional fighter at one time . He has the requisite charm , good looks and athleticism for the role . Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware , his romantic interest who insists that she hates him . In real life , she does n't seem to have existed ; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895.<br /><br />The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing . Corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form . In the film , Corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents ; it is believed that he wore down John L. Sullivan this way.<br /><br />Good film to catch Flynn at the height of his too - short time as a superstar .
1 Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the ' 40 's and years before that . And I mean that in a positive way , since I 'm definitely ai n't no Bay - hater . His movies are just simple high quality entertainment , just like the Raoul Walsh movies were in his days.<br /><br />"Gentleman Jim " is fine quality entertainment . Besides a first class director , it also features a first grade cast , with Raoul Walsh 's regular leading man Errol Flynn in the main part.<br /><br />What surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen . They used some very dynamic camera - work , which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch , with the end championship fight against John L. Sullivan as the ultimate highlight . < br /><br />Biopics of the ' 40 's and earlier on were obviously still very much different from biographies being made this present day . Modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show his / her life from basically birth till death and everything , mostly emotional aspects , in between . ' Old ' biopics were just made the same as movies that were n't based on actual real life persons , which also means that the film - makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character 's personality and events that happened in his / her life . This movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare knuckle fighting entered the modern era of boxing.<br /><br />Errol Flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim . Not too many people known it but Flynn did some real good acting jobs in the ' 40 's , of which this movie is one . Fysicaly he also looks in top - shape . He also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie . The movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout.<br /><br />A great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today.<br /><br />8/10
1 ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting Irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan ( WARD BOND ) went around claiming that he " could beat any man alive . " Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen.<br /><br />Raoul Walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style , capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm - hearted and full of good humor . All the Warner contract players make up the fine cast -- including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn 's rambunctious father , proud of his son 's fighting abilities , and ALEXIS SMITH who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking Flynn down a peg with saucy one - liners dealing with his conceited manners.<br /><br />All of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious B&W , although it 's too bad Warners did n't have more faith in Flynn to do the film in color . He was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time , engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen , with Flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action . And the scene where Bond turns over his award plaque to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward 's finest moments in a long career as a character actor.<br /><br />Summing up : Maintains interest all the way through , whether you 're a sports fan or not .
1 I meant that in a GOOD way , believe me . True to life , it ai n't . The whole Oirish thing gets kinda thick , but you DO enjoy the cast here - Flynn , Smith , Bond , Watson , Frawley , etc . All good . I also liked seeing Mike Mazurki - of Course he played a boxer , what else ? Typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes , one after the other.<br /><br />Flynn is fine as Gentleman Jim , you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here , I suppose , but it 's okay , it 's a cartoon and meant to please , that 's all . The boxing scenes were pretty good , Ward Bond 's vaudeville logging act a riot , and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times.<br /><br />Really alotta fun , Flynn was on a roll at that time and it 's clear to see why audiences loved him.<br /><br / > * * * outta * * * *
1 Gentleman Jim is another case of print the legend , with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath . It 's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn 's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out , filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by Raoul Walsh 's vivid direction . Flynn is still at the height of his powers ( you 'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production ) , with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure , this time as Flynn 's father ( Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time ) . Indeed , even the pirate galleon from Flynn 's earlier movies makes a somewhat out - of - place cameo in a dockside bout ! The 103 minutes just breeze by .
1 I saw this film at a store in the cheap section . I actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago . I thought " What the hey ' and bought it , basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes ( this was also before I became a huge Kate Beckinsale fan).<br /><br />So it 's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in Bangkok , get busted for narcotics ( which they are innocent of ) and then are sent to a Thailand prison . The film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence.<br /><br />Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances , and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally , and raises some nice moral discussion questions.<br /><br />I think this is a solid good film , but there could have been some improvements . It could have been longer ... it would 've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of Thailand 's justice system would 've helped.<br /><br />Nevertheless , other than that , it 's a good film with some great performances.<br /><br />P.S. For all you pop - culture junkies be on the lookout for a two - minute role by Paul Walker . I did n't even notice him the first time I saw the film .
1 I saw this movie by luck , just because I was going through a phase where I had a new found admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank God I did ! This Movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites ! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they 'll learn the true meaning of freedom.<br /><br />Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story . The struggle they go through as they are arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense . The acting is amazing , the images extraordinary , the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful . I actually ca n't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it . I know some people have n't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but I swear , this one , you have to see ! ! ! I promise it will stick with you !
1 I saw this movie a million years ( 5 years to be exact ) ago for the first the time . In the light of recent events with the Australian woman Schapelle Corby being imprisoned in Indonesia for so called smuggling pot , I decided to watch this movie again . I excepted to cry my heart out , 'cause I 'm sucker for hot girls in need ( just read my review of ' the stalking of Laurie Show ' ) . Some moist escaped my eyes , but it were hardly buckets filled with tears . Why ? Not because the two heroines were n't utterly adoring and helpless , not because the movie was n't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions . Why then ? Why did I not cry ? I wanted to cry ! When I rent a movie like this , I except to be moved , to sob like there 's no tomorrow , to feel miserable and like it . This movie was simply too short to do this . It was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements , and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside . Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends , but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing ( and oppressing ) surroundings . The mental journey is missing here for some reason . You only get to see the key moments of it ( which are very touching , I admit ) , probably because of bad editing . Sometimes I felt these girls were walking around in a postcard . The relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention . What 's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents ( especially between Alice and her dad ) ? You catch a glimpse of it , but the film does n't quite offer the whole picture , sadly enough.<br /><br />Nonetheless this was a great movie , and at the end I even had to bite my lip a bit . But I guess this has more to do with the acting skills ( and the looks ) of the actresses ( and the music ) then with the merit of the director . To be honest , I hardly knew who Kate Beckinsale was before I watched this movie ( again ) . Now , I am a fan ! Great movie , as long as you do n't expect it to be classic cinema .
1 Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind . It 's an amazing story , showing two girl 's plight for freedom against the Thailand justice system . They soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about.<br /><br />Alice Morano ( Claire Danes ) and Darlene Davis ( Kate Beckinsale ) , are two best friends , strait out of high school . They suddenly change their vacation plans from Hawaii to Thailand , and are immediately captivated by a young man , Nick Parks . He flirts with them both , and suggests that the three of them go to Hong Kong for the weekend.<br /><br />When the two arrive at the airport , they are immediately searched for drugs . Someone tipped off customs , and in an instant , their life is changed forever . In the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life , they learn about a highly respected lawyer , named Hank Green ( Bill Pullman).<br /><br />An American who knows the Thai justice system , he fights for the girl to be free . But they soon find out , when they leave or go is all up to them.<br /><br />If you 're looking for a great movie that 'll stay with you for years - Brokedown Palace is definitely the way to go .
1 Alice(Claire Danes ) and Darlene(Kate Beckinsale ) have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to Thailand . Due to a incident , they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him Hong Kong for the weekend . But at the airport , Alice and Darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison . Now it 's time for ultimate survival and true friendship . This was a pretty good movie , i 've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained . Claire Danes did a great job as usual , she is a great actress . I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
1 This movie is cold , bare truth . Often we think " oh no , that wo n't happen to me . " But it can . Drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly ( or tricked ) into doing things for smugglers . The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them , only wanted a exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare . People need to know that these sort of events are n't improbable or exaggerated - this IS a major problem in today 's society.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie . It is very emotional and raw . Well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory .
1 " What would you do ? " is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional Brokedown Palace . You will also be left wondering if Alice ( Danes ) was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved , and rightly so . This is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film . Although it is slow at times , its pace is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat ; wanting to know what happens next . The ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters , which are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes . Bill Pullman 's performance is commendable , too .
1 I love Claire Danes , and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role . The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery , working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial - arts - like discipline . The acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed - to - be Thailand is eye - catching , but Claire Daines steals the entire movie , and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end , in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world . The flaws are minute and I recommend the film , which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings . I for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only " 10 " rated films . Watch it , you will be very touched .
1 It 's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other American movie , and then be surprised when that does n't happen . I like a happy ending as much as the next guy , but sometimes it 's better to portray things in a more realistic manner , and I thought Brokedown Palace did this very well.<br /><br />The ending , with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other , thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place , was very moving . I almost rather would have done without the last line , which proved that she did n't actually do the deed she confessed to , because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls , and less about the crime . Whether she did it or not was n't that important.<br /><br />The story itself bordered on the cliché , but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances . Very realistic , very captivating.<br /><br />7 out of 10 .
1 We all have friends . Some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with , people that you can say are like your brother or sister . Alice ( Danes ) and Darlene ( Beckinsale ) are like that . You can see that from the beginning . They graduated together , they go to parties together and they decide to go to Bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to Hawaii . They also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster . The rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope . It also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone.<br /><br />Brokedown Palace is a very good film , it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that I want to talk about . But first I want to say what is good about the film . And for starters the acting is top notch , and you can look no further than the two leads . Danes and Beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have . Alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges , but she seems more fun than Darlene . But sometimes that fun can get her into trouble . Darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes , it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of Alice 's . Bill Pullman is adequate as the American lawyer living in Thailand . The film is photographed very well also . The inside of the prison while not the same as Shawshank or Natural Born Killers or Return To Paradice , but it does show the necessary ( but underdone ) hopelessness of the situation that they are in . Johnathin Kaplan 's direction is quite good as well . We see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day . Brokedown Palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive . The other thing that I had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film . It heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection . The song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison . You can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life . And it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do . We have it easy compared to some country 's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject . Some of the music is done by a group called Delirium ( I think ) but it is Sara McLaughlin ( wrong spelling , but how do you spell her last name ? ) that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film.<br /><br />What I did n't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit . I wo n't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you 'll know what I am talking about . Also I did n't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad . It looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country , the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic . But I did n't get that here.<br /><br />Overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question , " How far would you go for a friend ? " That is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation . Let 's just hope that it never comes down to that .
1 In the film " Brokedown Palace , " directed by Jonathan Kaplan , two best friends , Alice ( Claire Danes ) and Darlene ( Kate Beckinsale ) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to Hawaii , but hear that Bangkok , Thailand , is much more fun . They switched plans and decided to go to Thailand without telling their parents the change of plans . While they were in Thailand , Alice and Darlene met a really handsome guy named Nick Parks ( Daniel Lapaine ) . He tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in Hong Kong . They accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs . They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison . < br /><br />I think Kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever . Also , a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face . Those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever . Things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made . Sometimes life is not fair , that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made.<br /><br />This movie has a great setting ; it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand . This film also has great music ; a few of my favorite songs are ' Silence ' by Delerium , ' Damaged ' by Plumb , ' Deliver me ' by Sarah Bightman and ' Party 's just begun ' by Nelly Furtado . I went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film . These girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly , a mistake that anyone could make , therefore this film is good for any audience . It makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes . Even though , I did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs ? -- I would definitely give this film two thumbs up .
1 I like films that do n't provide the typical " happy ending , " and that 's my main reason for my liking of this movie . Alice Marano ( Danes ) and her best friend Darlene ( Beckinsale ) are arrested in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the Thai authorities . The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether ( or which ) of the girls was involved , and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer . Jacqueline Kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind , magnanimous wife , Yon , who is also an attorney . I wish the girls had been abused more in the prison , as another commenter has suggested , as I 've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal . Where this film grabs me , however , is its ending . Alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be pardoned , and we ( the viewers ) realize that they are both innocent . Any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me , and this well - acted drama is certainly deserving .
1 I caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it 's entirety and I 'm glad I did . I was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved . Naive high school graduates , best friends since childhood , take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named Nick who get them into serious trouble . They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring . Taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble . Everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their American lawyer " Yankee Hank " . Hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice(Claire Dane ) . However , the Thai native wife of Hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized . The end of the movie when Alice does a selfless act to save Darlene ( Beckinsale ) had me in tears . I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it .
1 While I do not think this was a perfect 10 , I do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it 's rated here . No , Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it 's plot has been done many times before . That does n't mean it should n't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments . The acting of Claire Danes , as already mentioned many times , was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman 's wife , the crooked cop , skip or trip or whatever his name is ) . The cinematography was also beautifully filmed , there was a lot that 's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major ones that I found ) as well.<br /><br />Here is what I did n't like about it - the friendship between the girls - In fact , the girls ' own individual personalities - were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic . It would not have been improbable to lose interest before then , because , despite the positives , more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested , were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film . That , however , is not my major problem . And WARNING - SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />The ending as mentioned dozens of times already , was AWFUL . It was awful in two respects . Firstly , even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood , I wanted a happy ending ! Yes , it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this , there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that . I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out or , barring that , at least the cop should have got what was coming to him . I mean nothing happens To the bad guys , they all get away with it . Very disturbing.<br /><br />Also , I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending . I understand endings that are inspired to make one think , but this was not a mystery or " Clue " type movie we were watching , and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened , who was guilty etc , with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel , I did not want to be kept guessing.<br /><br />Still , there was a lot to like about this movie , and the acting is definitely at the top of the list , I would rate this a 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look .
1 I watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend . I got my judgment teeth pulled out so I did n't feel very good.<br /><br />I ended up liking it big time . It 's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship , unwanted betrayal , power , money , drug traffic , and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail.<br /><br />The acting is on it 's prime level . Two of the women that I lust the most star and that 's a good thing . Claire Danes is as cute and charming as always while Kate Beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance . Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities.<br /><br />There are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience . Plus it shows the difficult times at Thailand.<br /><br />This is an underrated movie . Not many films like this one have come up in recent history . It should make you reflex about many things ...
1 I saw this movie in the theater , and was thoroughly impressed by it . Then again , that was when Claire Danes was a good actress , not the foolish , arrogant , Hollywood - ized bitch she is today . Anyway , this film really struck me as one of the more raw , realistic , beautiful friendship films . How far would you really go for your best friend ? I was moved to tears at the end , and still tear up when I watch it now ( I own it ) . I remember as soon as I left the theater , I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her . This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend . However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you 'd do something like that for her ....
1 I have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now . Brokedown Palace has that ` hard to believe ' aspect , however with the ingenious directing , and screenplay , Palace scores big . < br /><br / > I 've really never enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies , but I 'll tell you what , she really changed my mind with this one . Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on a vacation to Thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him . However , he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him . Well , ultimately they get caught , and end up in a Thailand prison . I know , I know , how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs ? Well if you can get by that one tiny miscue , you will find a very well written , and acted out story . Lately I have found myself getting drawn into the storylines of the movies I watch , and developing a personal feeling for the characters that I watch . This movie is no different . By the end of the movie I found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film . < br /><br / > Bill Pullman plays Hank Green , an attorney who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations . As always Pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully . < br /><br / > There are a few twists and turns that will , by the end of the movie , have you in tears . This is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home . It is my opinion that the next time out at the video store , do not pass by this one again .
1 Two adventurous teenagers , best friends , take a trip to Thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college . It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land , until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage . They get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the U.S.<br /><br />This is the main story line for " Brokedown Palace " and it was a good one . The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations . Actually , the portrayal was rather mild , as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted . It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is , it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately , there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story . The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy . To think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra , and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors , assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads.<br /><br />The story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in Alice 's ( Claire Danes ) backpack . Did she actually agree to transport the drugs ? We are left to guess . It was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls ' innocence throughout the film , but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty . Except for this considerable flaw , the ending was excellent and the results unexpected.<br /><br />The acting by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done . Danes , who has been oversold and over hyped , actually arrived as an actor in this film . Though her portrayal was frequently immature ( as was her character ) , she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire . Beckinsale , in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody - two - shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison . Her 's was the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Bill Pullman was miscast as the lawyer . His wry and diffident style is an asset in films like " While You Were Sleeping " , but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice , he had the wrong personality.<br /><br />The tourist 's look at Thailand was interesting , but it did n't make me want to go there.<br /><br />Overall , an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes . I gave it a 7/10 .
1 Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends , Alice and Darlene , who go on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage . In this way , the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film , such as " Return to Paradise " , but instead , the movie chose to focus little on the girls ' situation and more on their friendship.<br /><br />Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn in excellent performances , and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion , the jealousy , the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship . This movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life ( which is a bit glossed over ) , and focuses more on these friendship issues.<br /><br />There were some plot holes here , and some parts that just did n't seem believable or realistic . We did n't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have . And we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls , with Bill Pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold . In short , this should , by all rights , have been a much darker movie than it was.<br /><br />But overall , I enjoyed it . The acting was good , the soundtrack was perfect , and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting . Worth seeing .
1 I loved the movie , but like everyone said , there were some bits that were n't developed enough . I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison ; sure , they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still ... I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have . For example , in the montage where they 're sight - seeing , the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward - looking.<br /><br />Then , there are some parts that were very ambiguous . I think it 's pretty much understood that Danes ' character did n't do it , but I can see how that could be confusing . Also , why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk ? I thought it was suggesting something , but it turned out to be nothing.<br /><br />Apart from that , the movie was great . I cried when Claire Danes took the blame ; she 's a GREAT actress.<br /><br />Also , I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked . Talk about lack of closure ...
1 I think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie ! or Damn Australian ? I still do n't know , but what I know is that I really liked this movie but that could n't be my favorite movie!<br /><br />Great story with great actors but with a terrible end ... To make you cry and say ' Oh , she 's so good ' ... Still , who made it ? What really happened ? Who 's that guy ? No answer to these questions ... <br /><br />Mysterious movie with a good mark overall ... I give it a 8/10 , going on the 8.5 !
1 * Possible Spoilers * Although done before ( and better ) in ' Midnight Express ' and ' Return To Paradise ' , Brokedown Palace still strikes a chord with me.<br /><br />Here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through Thailand , and get arrested on charges of trafficking drugs . Was it Clare Danes ' Alice ? Was it Kate Beckinsale 's Darlene ? Was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey ? None of that really matters , for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to . Throw in Bill Pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride ( and better lawyer than he is ) and we have a nice little story that holds the audience 's attention.<br /><br />Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary , or notorious for any reason - it is not an original concept , it does n't show sensationalised violence that leads to the wannabe - avant - garde crowd talking about it 's " gritty realism " or " hard hitting truths " - it is merely a good story with some fine performances . Bill Pullman is weakest with his lazy drawl and gravelly way of talking - I was quite bored with the character.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale , while decent , is nothing spectacular . She acts well , but it 's not exactly a memorable performance.<br /><br />Jacqueline Kim however , is in fine form , crafting a likable and defined character where , really , there is not much to work with.<br /><br />But make no mistake - this is Clare Danes ' movie . I 've long been a fan of her work , and this is no change . She captivates in every scene she appears , and were it not for her , the film would probably stoop into boring fare . I particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and Darlene 's father.<br /><br />The film also has a brilliant soundtrack.<br /><br />7 out of 10
1 Good exciting movie , although it looks to me that it 's not been recorded on location in Thailand , it still looks realistic . Nice story about some girls having ' fun ' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world . In real the Thai people are very kind .
1 After high - school graduation , best friends Alice and Darlene , decide to take a trip to Thailand . Whilst they are there , they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick . After spending some time with Nick , he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him . They agree . At the airport though , they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they have n't done . Not really knowing what to do they end contacting Yankee Hank , an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife . Word has it that if you have the money he can help you . Things start of well , but they still ca n't get out.<br /><br />The movie is really good because it does n't let on what 's going to happen and it 's interesting all the time . I could n't believe the ending though . It was one of those endings where you do n't know the 100 % truth , but you still kind of know what really happened with Nick and the drug smuggling because of the ' owning up ' etc . < br /><br />Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give quite good performances here . Beckinsales performance was a little weak though . Both Danes and Beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger . Paul Walker even has a small uncredited role here . ; ) < br /><br />Anyway , I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it a 7/10 .
1 This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots . The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong . The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly . This film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie . It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into . Solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office . An excellent piece of work !
1 A good film with strong performances ( especially the two leads ) . The film is about two American girls who are caught with 6 kilo 's heroin on an airport in Thailand . They 're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession . Bill Pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out . All they have to do is find a Nick Parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls . So far for the story which is n't that original ( it has many resemblances with the better Return to Paradise).<br /><br />The acting and Newton Thomas Sigel 's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch . A 7 out of 10 .
1 ( originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug 's Life was too much , too fast -- he was " dazed and exhausted " by the visuals , and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br /><br />Okay , first off , I 'm 26 years old , have a job , go to school , and have a fiance ' . So maybe I 'm nuts and just really good at hiding it ... but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug 's Life exhausted or dazed , it was n't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals -- because the first time I went to see this movie , I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being " wowed " by each frame visually . How can you not empathize with Flik and his road - to - heck - paved - with - good - intentions life ? " Heck " indeed , I found myself identifying with that little ant ( not to mention some of the other bugs ) in a lot more ways than one ... and that , in itself , says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy . Of course , it 's beautiful ( every blade of grass , the tree , the rain ... ) . Of course , what they can do with technology is amazing ( you can read their lips ! try it ! ) . But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech , not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color . No , A Bug 's Life would be static if it were all that and no story . But , I 'm glad to say , it 's not ! A Bug 's Life has real heart . Yes , there 's a lot going on , storyline - wise as well as visually , but that 's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them ! Just because it 's a kids ' movie does n't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door -- kids are smarter than you think ! Besides that , I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves , even before their kids ... and it shows , in the amount of heart in has . This movie is moving , touching , funny , intriguing , and generally engrossing . The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing , there 's a major amount of character growth , and not just of the main character -- so rare in animation and often in movies in general . It does n't hit you over the head with its points once it 's made them -- every scene , every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there , and there are no gratuitous shots . Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety , to me , folks ; it means not " dumbing down " your movie and assuming the audience is stupid , which it mostly is not . All I can think is , if you can see A Bug 's Life and not feel anything at all , then you must have never made a big mistake , hurt your friends , had a crush , fallen in love , been frustrated that no one would listen to you , lied to someone you care about , felt like a social misfit , gotten excited over a new idea , come up with a great idea , had what you thought was a great idea backfire , been awkward one moment and confident the next , felt the pressure of responsibility , stood up for yourself and your loved ones , stood alone against the crowd , felt like a failure , felt like a big success , felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others ... well , you get the point . Final words : A+ rating from me ; please , if you 're going to see it try to see it in the theatre ( pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie ) ; if you loved Toy Story you 'll most likely love this ( PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart ) ; if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL wo n't know what you 're missing ( the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable ) ; and whenever you 're feeling really low , just pretend it 's a seed , okay ?
1 " A Bug 's Life " is like a favorite candy bar -- it 's chock - full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.<br /><br />The story could n't have been better ; it 's clever , has " heart " ( emotion ) , and every character has a nice " arc " ( a growth or change ) . By comparison , the only characters in " Toy Story " to have an " arc " are Buzz , who learns to love being a toy , and Woody , who overcomes his resentment of Buzz . There are tons of laughs and cute moments in " A Bug 's Life " . All of the actors turn in great voice work , and the animation , both the motion and detail , is superb.<br /><br />This serious movie buff does n't throw around " 10"s lightly , but this movie certainly deserves the " 10 " I gave it .
1 There is great detail in A Bug 's Life . Everything is covered . The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw - dropping . The film is n't too terribly orignal , it 's basically a modern take on Kurosawa 's Seven Samurai , only with bugs . I enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad . It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut - outs . The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper , the lead bad guy , was a brillant creation . Check this one out .
1 This is a FUNNY film . It has all the usual Disney components ( music , great range of characters , story , appeal ) , entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say " Antz " and " Price of Egypt".<br /><br />The characters work really well , and have a strong appeal , and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers . The movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format , which adds to the cinema experience.<br /><br />Call me crazy , but I have seen the film three times , and I intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend . Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed . I work in a multiplex , and I can honestly say that no - one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />See it , and do n't be put off because it is animated . You are sure to enjoy this movie , and make sure you stay for the end credits ! The bloopers and out - takes at the end are the funniest part of the film , which is packed with laughs throughout .
1 A Bugs Life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too . The story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil Grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food ( A Mirror of the Magnifiscent seven ) . There is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too . You will love it ! ! 8 out of 10
1 Critically , people say that Antz is better . Antz is a good film , but I enjoyed Bug 's Life a bit more . I ca n't remember a Pixar animation , other than the two Toy Story films , that I was laughing so hard . The animation is clean , the story is original and does n't preach . The voice overs are what make this movie . Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot . Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey , as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary , David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn , and I could go on and on . The script is fantastic , so funny and sometimes even touching . It lacks the social messages of Antz , but what we have is rock - solid entertainment . 9/10 . Bethany Cox
1 You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation , and the novelty probably wo n't wear off on the first , second or third viewing , but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing , that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way , which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.<br /><br />Disney continues to firmly hold the title of " Greatest Animation in the World " , with " A Bug?s Life " standing as one of their greatest achievements . One of the innovative attachments being the delightful " out - takes " added to the end of the film . The DVD has two sets of these out - takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape . The DVD also features " Gerry?s Game " which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.<br /><br />This is by far the superior insect - film in comparison to Dreamworks ? " Antz " , which in all fairness is pretty good , but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters . If you look at the star voices of both films , " Antz " is largely cast with big name " movie " stars with a few familiar " TV " star voices , where " A Bug?s Life " is just the opposite , loaded with " TV " stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception . But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.<br /><br />Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though , when you go head to head with Disney , you have your work cut out for you . This is the kind of film that almost makes me wish I had children to share it with . Don?t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids , though .
1 Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar 's A Bug 's Life ; we 're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film , but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation . For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it 's in the right hands that is  A Bug 's Life is a warm reminder . We walk out of the film with an equally - warm feeling , and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high - calibre film productions.<br /><br />It is only Pixar 's second animated feature . The sub - group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 , with their landmark movie Toy Story . It was a movie which defied convention , re - invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence . Now , they return with their sophomore effort which , to be honest , draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.<br /><br />After all , it 's a film about ants . Well , all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug 's Life , but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film , as humans are the focal point in dramas , romances and so on . How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie , let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film ? Surely they jest . However , we forget that in Toy Story , a bunch of toy - box items were able to become the grandest , most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted . The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat , and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you 'll probably ever encounter.<br /><br />Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there is n't an unpleasant character in sight ; even the villains are riveting characters  but they 're colourful , they 're eclectic , and they 're idiosyncratic . And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term , only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug 's Life from the beginning . We shall start with our main character , and our hero . His name is Flik ( David Foley ) , and his character is rather generic to say the least . Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush , beautiful Ant Island , he is the one considered the ' black sheep ' of the clan , as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season 's harvest with his antics.<br /><br />The problem arises in the fact that the ants ' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper ( Kevin Spacey ) , who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants ; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone , they go insane , for lack of a better term . Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack 's hands ; however , it 's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil . The cogs and clockwork in Flik 's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame , and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony 's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.<br /><br />If you think about it , A Bug 's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line 's of Akira Kurosawa 's classic Seven Samurai , or the American remake The Magnificent Seven , in which a village of hapless but good - hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village - dweller goes in search for help in the big city , finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil . In A Bug 's Life , the help comes in the form of a down - and - out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar - room brawl.<br /><br />Much amusement comes out of these scenes , and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs . Among them are an erudite stick insect ( David Hyde Pierce ) , a side - splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi - femme fatale ladybug who 's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug ( Dennis Hopper ) . It 's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on - screen , as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on - screen , as is the entire movie collectively.<br /><br />As I 've said , much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another , which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines , wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie . What makes A Bug 's Life even better is that the film is n't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be , although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid - friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we 'd like . However , it 's easy to ignore this fault , and it 's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.<br /><br />Although A Bug 's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor , this is still a superb movie , and the start of something promising here . Pixar have proved that they 're not just a one - hit wonder , but instead a much - gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood . They raise the bar endlessly , and when someone always manages to top their standards , it 's only always by themselves . What more is there to say about A Bug 's Life other than : see it ; it 's not quite the best which we 've seen from the folks at Emeryville , California , but this beats out the lot of its year  and I 'll be damned if this is n't the best animated feature of 1998.<br /><br />8.5/10
1 The movie was totally Awesome and Cool . The graphics was superb and it was amazing , Especially , Flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent . The circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie . The grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie . Hopper was a pure and perfect villain . Even , Dot was cute . When , the bird comes to eat the bugs , that scene was superb and good . Even , the last scene was awesome and cool . Even , Flik 's inventions was good . Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers . When , the ants are building the artificial bird , that scene was good and nice I should really appreciate the creators of " A Bug 's Life " .
1 When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story . As soon as I saw that I knew this was gon na be a good feature ! I was right ! A Bug 's Life like Toy Story is great story , great characters and great animation . My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft . My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick ( David Hyde Pierce ) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich 's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird . How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim 's like I 'm going to snap ! I 'm going to snap ! I just died laughing at that scene . Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug 's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever ! I do n't know how you could hate a Pixar film ! I think they 're all pretty good films ! Good job PIXAR !
1 Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson 's early Bean performances , and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work , something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages , in a way that just makes you feel good . A Bug 's Life has that same charm , it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects , because even though they talk , they still ACT just like real bugs . It 's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them , to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.<br /><br />Honey , I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger , and to me , A Bug 's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie , if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story - telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities . I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story ( which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made ) , because the story of A Bug 's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story 's , but then again , almost nothing is . The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun . < br /><br />The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society , mostly geared around building a harvest of food , most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers , vastly superior in strength and general meanness , and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter . We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers , who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food , the consequences will be dire . And incidentally , the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse - tung 's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the " Great Leap Forward  " < br /><br />The fun and excitement begins when Flik , the main character , sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers . You see , he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger , so he feels it 's his responsibility , but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers . Great for the audience , not so great for the safety of the clan . < br /><br />The movie was released back in the late 90s , when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos , like Armageddon and Deep Impact , Independence Day and The Arrival , A Bug 's Life and Antz , etc . Comparisons between A Bug 's Life and Antz are inevitable , although it seems clear to me that A Bug 's Life is by far the superior film , and not only because it does n't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role . This is great family fun !
1 When watching A Bug 's Life for the first time in a long while , I could n't help but see the comparisons with last year 's Happy Feet . As far as the main storyline goes , they are very similar , an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special . It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion . A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar 's sophomore effort . Sure it does n't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story , nor is the animation out of this world . However , the story is top - notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with . With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot , I could watch this one just as much as the studio 's other classics.<br /><br />There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here . Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self - esteem up to save his colony , the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future , and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks , everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story . Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons . He is not doing it to be mean , but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 . He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth . It is very much a circle of life , but not one that ca n't evolve with the ages.<br /><br />When thinking about the animation , it is actually quite good . Compared to Antz , the rival film of the time , this is much more realistic and less cartoony . The water is rendered nicely , as is the foliage . You do n't have to look much further than the ants ' eyes to see how much detail went into the production . The reflections and moistness , despite the smooth exterior , shows the realism . All the bugs are finely crafted too . The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on , whether for a small role or a more expanded one . It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments . While Ant Island is nice , it is just the outdoors . Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs . It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything . From the ice cube trays as circus stands , the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades , everything is done right.<br /><br />As far as much of the humor , you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices . No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit . I dare you to think of someone better . Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis - Dreyfus as Princess Atta , as well as the always - fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper . Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie , but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits . Yes , A Bug 's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar , a tradition that has continued on . With many tongue - in - cheek bug jokes laced throughout , you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast . Full of " those guy actors , " it is people like Richard Kind , Brad Garrett , and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.<br /><br />Overall , it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar , one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years , but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience . There are joyous moments , sad times , and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun . Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters , Tuck and Roll , there is n't too much bad that I can think of saying about it .
1 Many of the American people would say ... What ? ? ? to my opening comment . Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa , but if you analyze this movie , my comment is right . We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village . The great difference is the way that the story takes . Our samurais , a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs , HEROES . Please watch again this incredible movie ( the Seven Samurai , obviously ) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa . A tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas , Michael Crichton copied the story to wrote his Best seller 's , but he did n't found the third foot of the cat .
1 A Bug 's Life is a very good animated feature . This movie is for younger children , but it is also a great movie for people my age . The story is about an ant named Flik . He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers . He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess . This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie . The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90 's . The story is good , but a little more detail would be suffice . The voice acting is good as with most animation movies . The music is nice to listen to . Nothing special , but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories . Overall , this movie struck me as awestruck . This is a good movie for all families . I rate this movie 10/10 .
1 Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full - length CGI animated movies they have made . " A Bug 's Life " was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far , preceded by the company 's feature - length debut , the groundbreaking " Toy Story " , which was the first ever feature - length CGI movie . I remember when this follow - up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990 's , but I never actually saw it until November 2006 . I watched it twice that month , and over three years later , I have seen it a third time . It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I 've ever seen , but after three viewings , I still think it 's better than some of the films I 've seen from DreamWorks Animation.<br /><br />Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants . These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year . One member of this colony is Flik , an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions , even though he does n't mean to . One year , when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering , Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it ! The grasshopper leader , Hopper , decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season , but they will have to double their offering ! Flik suggests to the colony 's royal council that he goes and finds " warrior bugs " to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back . Princess Atta , the future Queen , lets him go on this mission just so he wo n't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering . The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors , but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them , he learns that they are actually not warriors , but circus bugs!<br /><br />The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters . To me , none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have , and generally seem a bit bland . Fortunately , however , it 's not like " Shark Tale " , a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character . " A Bug 's Life " does have a likable enough main character , one which viewers can root for . The story also seems somewhat bland at times , but for the most part , it 's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining , and sometimes has some good suspense , especially later on . The humour , like certain other aspects of the film , is n't as good as it could have been , but there are definitely funny moments , some of them involving Francis , a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female . You can always expect great animation from Pixar , and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception . With all this movie has to offer , it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards , but it is reasonable family entertainment .
1 Bugs life is a good film . But to me , it does n't really compare to movies like Toy story and stuff . Do n't get me wrong , I liked this movie , but it was n't as good as Toy story . The film has the visuals , the laughs , and others that Toy story had . But the film did n't feel quite as ... I do n't know , but I thought it was still a pretty good film . < br /><br />A bugs life ... I do n't want to say this , is a film that I do n't remember . I saw it years ago . Of course , I have n't seen Toy story in years , but I still remember it . I should n't have reviewed this film , but I am . I am giving it a thumbs up , though it 's not exactly the best work Pixar has done.<br /><br />A bug 's life:***/ * * * *
1 Now this is what a family movie should be ! There are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public ; but this IS one of them . My whole family came away from the film , awed , entertained , dazzled , and happy . We 're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there . The children LOVED it and so did we ( hubbie and I are 36 and 32 , respectively)!<br /><br />Apart from its beautiful and striking animation , the characters ( small as they may be , and imaginary as they are ) are very well developed . There is n't one of them that you can not empathize with . The personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents , combined with the skill and artistry of some of Disney 's best animators . This is a film worthy of Walt Disney , himself . I think Mr. Disney would heartily approve of this new film ... Flick , Dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time.<br /><br />This is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again .. and buy to own on video or DVD . I 'm eager to see it again .. to pick up what I might have missed the first time . ( Never have I seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before ... my daughter is still talking about little " Dot".)<br /><br />This film is funny , heartwarming , clever and great fun for the whole family !
1 I liked Antz , but loved " A Bug 's Life " . The animation that was put into this paid off . I will definitely be getting this on DVD . By the way , Disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape . ( I heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format ) . Most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest ! I only saw one of the two sets , but I ca n't wat to see the other one !
1 A must see by all - if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one . Easily one of the best animation / cartoons released in a long - time . It took the the movies Antz to a whole new level . Do not mistake the two as being the same movie - although in principle the movies plot is similiar . Just go and enjoy .
1 The animation was fab and the film funny . The two circus bugs , Tuck / Roll were very funny . If you waited till the credits at the end , you saw a very funny sequence of film , where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies , that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable .
1 For starters , it 's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh ( check out the two Russian bugs).<br /><br />A Bug 's Life has a classical Disney storyline , but that 's one of the good things about the movie . Family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end . And it also has a couple of great voice - overs by Dave Foley , Julia - Louise Dreyfus , Kevin Spacey ( of course ) , ... But actually , the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation . It 's just wonderful . All the details , great colors , every ant looks different , beautiful backgrounds ... And the guys and girls at Pixar made it all look so realistic . All in all , a very nice piece of work . This is the best animation by Disney since Aladdin .
1 Disney ( and the wonderful folks at PIXAR of course ) offer a nice , humourous story combined with the best of computer animation . I admit that maybe the ' faces ' of the bugs were a little more static than in ' Antz ' and they only had four legs ( in ' Antz ' six ... ) . But backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking . But let this be a lesson : it was not the computer who made it such a success : it was the man behind the machine , who added the nice little twists , which I missed in ' Antz ' . Some highlights were of course the ' bloopers ' at the end ( So keep watching at the end , it 's worth it ! ) , which were highly amusing and original . The line ' Filmed entirely on location ' was intended for the more attentive viewer .
1 All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios ' last productions , here comes something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all , A Bug 's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake " hand - made - old - Disneys - like " drawings ( see the Lion King , Pocahontas , and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi 's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).<br /><br />A bug 's life ( 1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks ! ) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say " Hey , this thing is computer generated ! " . No weak parts , a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets , an astonishing 3D bird ( close to perfection in its imitation of reality ) ... and that 's only to mention the technical aspects.<br /><br />The scenario , my friends , the real backbone of a motion picture , has some thickness ! Curiously , and obviously thanks to Lasseter 's team , there is practically no musical sequence in A bug 's life . Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate , but most others dislike ( same thing for the parents or the anime fans , like me ) . This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story ( a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen ( who finally turn to be actors ) to protect them , etc ... ) . Simple , but efficient , and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.<br /><br />Since Microcosmos , many movies tell tales of insects , their lives , fears and hopes , but I do think that A bug 's life is the funniest and best directed of all . The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved ... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik 's ( aka Tilt in France ) adventures.<br /><br />A big thank you for Lasseter 's team , especially for the last 30 seconds ... it 's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs / actors forget their lines or hit the camera ... <br /><br />And finally , especially for those of you who have seen the french version , other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie . A bug 's life is a really good piece of entertainment , and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos ( a privilege granted to extremely few movies , and that 's not a problem of storage room :) . Go and see it , that 's an order .
1 I was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film . If you sit close to the screen , you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures . The detail , colors , and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story . How they were able to pull off the shading , I will never know . I do hope that PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so I can find out how all this was accomplished . Based on this film , I think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film .
1 This movie blew me away . If you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of Antz . the plot , characters , and jokes are better in A Bugs life . Also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits . it 's the best part of the movie . Rating 9
1 I have to admit right off the top , I 'm not a big fan of " family " films these days . Most of them , IMHO , are sentimental crap . But this one , like TOY STORY , the previous film from Pixar , is a lot of fun . The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in ANTZ , but otherwise this film is better ) , but the rest of the film more than made up for it . The animation looked great , the humor , though broad , was consistently good(I especially liked Hopper 's line " If I had n't promised Mother on her deathbed that I would n't kill you , I would kill you ! " ) , and the actors doing the voices , except the two leads , were all terrific(Denis Leary doing an animated movie ; what a concept ) . And like everyone else , I loved the outtakes ! I hope the video has the new ones .
1 I thought this was a quiet good movie . It was fun to watch it . What I liked best where the ' Outtakes ' at the end of the movie . They were GREAT .
1 This movie is by far the cutest I have seen in a long time ! Wonderful animation and adorable characters ( even the bad guys were cute ! ) made this one a total winner in my book , and also in the books of those I saw it with . I still want to see it again , but have n't had time . Better than Toy Story , which was good too , but not THIS good .
1 To quote Flik , that was my reaction exactly : Wow ... you're perfect ! This is the best movie ! I think I can even say it 's become my favorite movie ever , even . Wow . I tell you what , wow .
1 < br /><br />This movie is full of references . Like " Mad Max II " , " The wild one " and many others . The ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference ( or tribute ) to Peter Lorre . This movie is a masterpiece . We´ll talk much more about in the future .
1 OK . I admit . I 'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series . Star Trek ( Next Generation ) was my first space date , and since then I 've switched partners regularly . I 've seen'em all , it seems , and my favorites are « Lexx » , « Farscape » and the new « Battlestar Galactica » , in other words : the newest , state of the art space operas . But , I also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones , the cheap ones , like the magnificent four seasoned BBC show « Blakes7 » . Here , the budgets are smaller than hobbits , the special effects seem to be made on a Commodore 64 , but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor , the acting dead serious and at times even high class?<br /><br />But why do they always speak English in the space future ? Because this is NOT the future , it 's fantasy for kids . Still , it can be irritating at times . Me , being a Norwegian , have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series , like science fiction , for Scandinavian viewers . I never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened . But it did , actually , once , and even in my own homeland , Norway . I was two years old when the so called Fjernsynsteatret ( TV theater section ) of our national public service channel Nrk produced this three episode version of Blindpassasjer ( The Stowaway).<br /><br />When I first heard of it , I was not surprised of the fact that until this day , the show has only been screened once in Norway , making it impossible for me to actually see it . It went on Swedish , danish and Finnish television also , in it 's time , but that was a long time ago . There have been no video or DVD release of it , not a surprise either , and when it was screened on an art house cinema , this happened in Bergen , a city far far away from Oslo ( where I live ) . And then there 's another fact about « Blindpassasjer » that did n't surprise me , that it was written by the two Norwegian authors Tor Åge Bringsværd and Jon Bing ( Bing&Bringsværd ) . This duo basically introduced the SciFi genre to Norwegians in the seventies ; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose . In my opinion , Bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers , and has written several great and entertaining novels , masterpieces even , some of them hilarious , such as « Bazar » and « Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost » . No other than this guy , also an acclaimed dramatist , could construct the script of « Blindpassasjer».<br /><br />When I finally got to watch it , it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR in the 80 's , eventually managed to transform it to DVD and give it to me . He was a nice bloke . So I sat down and watched it , with Swedish subtitles , bad sound and some scrapes and errors ; but the thing came through and I was surprised that I eventually came to love it.<br /><br />The exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in Blakes7 , and the credit goes to Caprino studios ( who made the famous Flåklypa Grand Prix ) , and the interior of the Marco Polo ( the space ship ) works better than I 'd expected . The acting is typically theatrical , but it works better than when they play Ibsen , to put it mildly , and Bjørn Floberg carries his role solidly , as does Trini Lund . The legendary actress Henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre , but this is an ensemble play , and I 'm happy to say that Ola B. Johannesen carries his mustache with nobility , and Marit Østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.<br /><br />But is it really that good ? Well , one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending , the pretentious criticism of « modern society » , but yes , it 's , well , not really really really fantastic , but charming , cool , nostalgic and pleasant . One and a half hour of classic Norwegian SciFi .
1 It 's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from Norway has been remastered for DVD release , and still gems like this do n't get a shot at recapturing their past glory . I give this a 7 , not because it is very good , but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television . This film is nothing less than a film - historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first Alien film . And , my word , Blindpassasjer was first ! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini - series ? However unlikely , the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar . Okay , the budget is _ much _ lower in the Norwegian film , but given that , it 's a really well - done piece of work from the desolate age of Norwegian movie - making , which incidentally lasted until the 90s .
1 I remember this show from Swedish television . I was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.<br /><br />I would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.<br /><br />Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space - thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s . When i think of it , this was a real sci - fi , a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are . The term sci - fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space - ships in them .
1 I recently ( May 2008 ) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD . Although I 've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then ( late 70 's ( I was 10 in 1978 ) ) , this three - episode , low budget thing still stands strong.<br /><br />What 's fun is that I now watched it with my 10 year old daughter , and she experiences just the same as I remember from back then : The creepy music ( she had to hold my hand , even though she 's been raised with watching LotR and Resident Evil ) , the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is , and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before Norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting.<br /><br />This is the one and only good science fiction movie ( or series ) ever made in Norway . And it 's still worth watching .
1 I watched it subtitled as it was in Russian , but really enjoyed it . The main character Sasha was born cursed , with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body . He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things . < br /><br />When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle . There was a fair amount of gore , but not too much for the weak stomached.<br /><br />Not for people who like the regular old Hollywood movie , but for those who enjoy independent films . Kinda got the feeling of an Asian fantasy film .
1 " Mechenosets " is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I 've ever seen . The name of the film can be translated in English as " the sword - bearer " . The main hero ( Sasha ) was born with one exceptional ability : he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand . At first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings . But it is not about Mechenosets . He hardly can be even called the anti - hero . I think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good , justice and love . In his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him ( except his mother ) . Every his step is stained with blood ; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him . And suddenly he meets her . She does n't need the idle talks and explanations . She loves him for what he is . She does n't care what he did . The fact that he 's next to her is more important than anything else . But soon she finds out his secret : he kills two people ( her ex - boyfriend and his bodyguard ) to protect her before her very eyes . Even after that she could n't escape her feelings . They try to run but it 's hart to hide . Finally they have a serious car accident . He is caged ; she is in a mental hospital . They do n't know anything about each other , but she believes that he 'll save her . He surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her . They run again but they are n't invulnerable . She is wounded , she needs a rest , but police almost catch them . He does n't know what to do , they drive into a corner , and then his sword begins to cut down trees , helicopter around them , but there is no need for it , because she is already dead in his arms , and he is the lonely person in the whole world again .
1 What happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers ? The premise may sound familiar . The Watchmen ? Unbreakable ? However , the Russian sci - fi action flick , The Sword Bearer , is far from the standard stock.<br /><br />The story revolves around a man named Sasha who as a boy was shunned from society , his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess . When he wishes or his anger allows , a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin . Very wolverinish ? Maybe ... but that 's not the interesting part of this film . Shunned all his life and driven by anger ( and a temper he does have ) our " hero " returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to . The only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame 's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground . This is where the vengeance and anger comes into play . This is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail . He meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about.<br /><br />The film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences . This is art house at it 's core , beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci - fi action . It 's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film . The directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of Sasha and not a straight action film . Do n't worry though , the action is there and plenty of it . However , much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath . This is not to say that action is not shown . These scenes are here and are fantastic ( especially the ending where we see Sasha 's full powers unleashed in desperation ) . The director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character 's emotional struggle at hand . This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre .
1 Despite the title , The Sword Bearer , and the DVD cover ( action / herioc poses of The Sword Bearer ) this is not a super hero film.<br /><br />(Minor Spoilers ) It follows the tale of Sasha , The Sword Bearer , who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm . Cool you say , but no , this is real life . If you had this power as a child could you control it when , say , faced by a mad man , or when your mum 's boyfriend is beating her . And if you do n't control it , how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.<br /><br />This essentially is where Sasha is when we meet him . Wandering aimlessly after another killing ( much like A Bout de Soufflé ) . He then meet Katya , and the pair fall instantly in love , providing Sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways . However , his past is still chasing him , in the form of two police officers.<br /><br />That is essentially the story , and there is virtually no action on screen , though a lot if suggested.<br /><br />I really like this movie . Unlike many Hollywood ' super hero ' films , we get very little back story , there is no bad guy ( unless you count The Sword Bearer himself ) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.<br /><br />Worth checking out if you can find it .
1 There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately.<br /><br />A friend , sends me movies now and again , as a surprise , it 's awesome.<br /><br />I turned it on and could n't stop watching , it is a drama , but with a odd twist . Imagine if Romeo , as in Shakepeare , had a super power . It is sad and poetic at the same time . Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian cinema , they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi . It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story , without a spectacle . This is a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist . Granted it 's not perfect , but nothing ever is . You know what the power is but it is never explained , nor totally realized until the end . It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story . I do n't want to see a remake , it is too cool as is , the Hollywood system would , as usual , mess it up . Acting is top notch all around . Directing and Camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there . Kudos to all involved , and I will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic . A+++++<br /><br />If you can find i , watch it .
1 Although I agree that it 's a good but not great movie , for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned , I still enjoy it . One reason is the music : I 'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the Candoli brothers -- Conte and Pete -- in a well - staged scene in the nightclub . These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day , and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of Jimmy Stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet , one trumpet in each of Stewart 's ears . The Candolis really did play that well , too , though I suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them . I do n't know much about George Duning , who gets the credit for the music ( other than that he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges on more than one occasion ) , but the casting of the Candoli brothers as jazz - playing warlocks was a real nice touch .
1 After you see Vertigo , then watch Bell , Book and Candle , made within months of each other.<br /><br />My second favorite Kim Novak film , with Picnic , coming in as third.<br /><br />All three performances are great , Vertigo , being the best , of all.<br /><br />They came to my nowhere Kansas Prairie town , near by , at Salina , Kansas in the 50s , to film , Picnic . < br /><br />Bell , Book and Candle 's musical score , I believe is one of Alex North 's . Perfect for this bit of comedy.<br /><br />After Vertigo , Stewart and Novak , did this comedy , how amusing to note the dramatic contrast.<br /><br />Worth your time , if you like Kim Novak . The Greta Garbo of my youth .
1 Have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed Kim Novak playing the role as Gil Holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother warlock named Nick played by Jack Lemmon . When Gillian sets her eyes on Shep Henderson,(James Stewart ) who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry ; Gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with Gillian . The story tells that a real witch can not fall in love , blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian , so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they have to do something about this situation . Great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958 .
1 I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic , and the older film was far superior . I liked the way the lighting , makeup , and costumes changed as Gillian changed in the story . Jimmy Stewart 's mannerisms did n't do a lot for me in this film , but I suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of Gillian 's character . I was also struck by Nicky 's and Gillian 's mannerisms -- it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and Gillian to appear masculine . The gestures Nicky makes when he 's showing Redlich his powers especially struck me . I 've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate , so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters .
1 " Bell Book and Candle " was shown recently on cable . Not having seen it for a while , we decided to take another look at this comedy . Based on the James Van Druten 's Broadway hit , which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties , the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash . The film was directed by Richard Quine , who turned the play into a delightful comedy.<br /><br />Evidently , judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb , the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars , who had collaborated on " Vertigo " , released the same year . Movie audiences did n't think anything about the age difference when this film was released . In fact , most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women.<br /><br />The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers . Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as it 's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing . As the witch that becomes human , her Gillian is charming . James Stewart , who plays the publisher Shep ' Henderson , is also seen at his best . Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top.<br /><br />In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester , playing Queenie , is a welcome addition to any movie , as she proves here . Jack Lemmon 's Nicky Holroyd , the brother of Gillian , is also good . Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch.<br /><br />This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching " Bell Book and Candle " .
1 John Van Druten 's " Bell , Book and Candle " is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern - day witches living in New York City ; it was obviously an attractive movie property . It had a stellar part for Gillian Holroyd , for her erstwhile book publisher enforced - sweetheart , Shepherd Henderson and her madcap family and circle , including Shep 's bewildered fiancée , the hateful Merle Kittredge , against whose chances with Shep Gillian begins her magical spell - casting . It even had Pyewacket , a Siamese cat - familiar with well - timed miaows , Sidney Redlitch , a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners . In short , it seemed to its producer , perhaps , box - office magic . And so it proved to be . So many things were right about its production , it only had one element not perfect ; but I found the rest to be amusing , charming and very consistently - entertaining . To begin with , the screenplay by Daniel Taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include Greenwich Village and other areas of New York 's scene . The technical production was beautiful , with cinematography by the legendary James Wong Howe , a fine score by George Duning , more - than - clever sets by Louis Diage and gowns by Jean Louis . In the attractive cast were Wolfe Barzell , Howard McNear , Janice Rule as Merle , Ernie Kovacs as Redlitch , Jack Lemmon as Gillia 's mischievous brother , wonderful comediennes Elsa Lanchester and Hermione Gingold as fellow witches and lovely Kim Novak in one of her most touching parts as Gillian . Jimmy Stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment ; he did well with the comedic portions of his part , but he was never convincing as a New York book publisher , and a bit too - old for the part of Henderson anyhow . But director Richard Quine used subtle lighting , pace changes , and unusually - composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film , keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation . The plot 's main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality Gillian falls for Henderson , who does not believe in witches at all . She started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée , her stuck - up college rival . Later , when Henderson tries to walk out , he keeps coming back to her -- and realizes he is under a spell , as she has apologetically tried to explain to him . .. Meanwhile , Sidney Redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to New York to sell his book to Henderson . Of course he knows nothing at all of magic , but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all ; but Gillian 's brother enlightens him . All comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as Gillian proves her love to Henderson by losing her powers -- which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal . Of course , he never really wanted to resist her anyhow . The film has sprightly dialogue , charm , and a little " magic " of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments Gillian must undergo in her battle with herself , and to win the man she loves . A lovely ending to this beautifully - photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism , though a fantasy , just about complete in my view . Memorably delightful .
1 I can watch B , B&C and feel all the emotions I felt when I first saw it at aged 18 well , maybe all but one . Certainly Miss K.Novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century . She was a thinking youth 's Diana Dors . All those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching , collar - tightening , blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good . Now , huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie , they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop , relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal . This movie is Miss Novak 's Golden Moment . She seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and , despite all this , she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence . She completely dominates the amiable Mr J.Stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie . Misses E.Lanchester and H.Gingold offer comic relief along with Mr E. Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed . Mr J.Lemmon plays Miss Novak 's brother . He is a beatnik , a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream . Some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later . Certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and Mr Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one . But all else is mere frippery , Miss Novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of Technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for " Bell , Book and Candle".It survives , its reputation enhanced , as the ultimate showcase for one of Hollywood 's most beautiful women . Loved by moviegoers , ignored by critics , Miss Novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the " Play " buttons on their DVDs . One day , probably after we are all gone , she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time .
1 Gillian Holroyd ( Kim Novak ) is a witch . Secretly , she 's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson ( James Stewart ) . She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her . Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man . She decides to tell him her secret . But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was " tricked " into falling in love with Gillian ? < br /><br />As far as light - hearted 1950s comedies go , Bell Book and Candle is good , but nothing spectacular . It 's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it . Just do n't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread . The movie 's cute , funny at times , and touching in the end . Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry . Novak ( as others have pointed out ) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way . The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon , Hermione Gingold , and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh - out - loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart . The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle ca n't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be . Is it a screwball comedy ? Is it a romantic comedy ? Is it a supernatural comedy ? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach , the movie might have been even better and more memorable .
1 It 's a gentle , easy - going 1950s comedy . Kim Novak belongs to a coven of witches in Manhattan . She puts a spell on neighbor Jimmy Stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him , losing her powers . See , witches are permitted to have " hot blood " but not love . Elsa Lanchester is Novak 's aunt , also a witch . Jack Lemmon is her brother , ditto . Hermione Gingold is the chief witch , and Ernie Kovacks is Sidney Redlich , an author who specializes in writing about witches.<br /><br />I described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else . Everything is so smooth and polished , from the set decoration , through wardrobe and plot , to the performances and direction . Take the character of Ernie Kovacks . He 's referred to as " a drunk and a nut . " And here 's how the movie demonstrates these traits . He asks for a second drink , and , though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen , his hair is a bit long and tousled . That 's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut . Nothing is out of place ; everything is tidy and free of dust . The soles of Jimmy Stewart 's shoes are barely scuffed.<br /><br />And the Zodiac Club , where the witches hang out . It 's called " a low dive . " Yet it 's a clean , dark place with polite waiters , a quintet of musicians , neatly dressed clientèle , and potted plants against bare brick walls . That is not my idea or yours of a " low dive " -- not even for Greenwich Village in 1958 . My idea of a dive in Greenwich Village is Julius 's or The White Horse Tavern or The San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous , a now defunct lesbian hangout . The Zodiac Club is a high dive compared to these.<br /><br />The kookiness we always hear about is muted by today 's standards . I mean , Kim Novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet . And she wears a lot of black clothes like the Beatniks of the period did.<br /><br />But never mind all that . It 's an enjoyable romantic comedy . Kim Novak is effective as Gillian , who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden . She has a strange beauty , bulky and ethereal at the same time . She glides rather than walks , a wispy presence . Her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic French curves . And Jimmy Stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim . In the 1930s he usually played in light roles . In the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist , but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use . Who could resist laughing when Hermione Gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of Novak 's spell ? It 's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming . Richard Quine directs the movie quietly , without fireworks or special effects , and does some interesting things that the play could n't have had . Note the scene in which Novak casts the spell over Stewart , when the Siamese cat 's face and ears seem to merge with Novak 's startling eyes.<br /><br />Ernie Kovacks in the 1950s was a well - known television personality . There was never anything quite like The Ernie Kovacks Show before -- or after . It brings the word " surrealism " to mind . He could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only Bartok 's Concerto for Orchestra as background . And he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of Percy Dovetail , an effete poet . The credits kind of skip over The Condoli Brothers but that 's rather casual because these two guys -- Pete and Conte -- were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles . Conte was later a member of Doc Severison 's band on Johnny Carson 's Late Show.<br /><br />The third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more " romantic " than " comedy " . But it 's never dull . The whole film rolls along as neatly as Van Druten 's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too .
1 For those of you unfamiliar with Jimmy Stewart , this is one of his " lesser " films from later in his career . And , while it is n't a great film compared to many of his other pictures , it is n't bad and is a decent time - passer -- but not much more.<br /><br />Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason , she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her . Over time , the cold and detached Ms. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart -- and apparently in the witch 's rule book , this is a definite NO , NO ! ! < br /><br />The film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches . They are neither the baby - sacrificing nor the all - powerful variety . Most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless ( such as Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps ) . And , very oddly , the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz . Considering what I think of jazz , it must really stink to be a witch in this movie 's world!<br /><br />Anyway , the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic , but not something I would rush out to watch . The acting is pretty good , but the script does n't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film -- in fact , I almost scored the film a 6 - -it was really close .
1 Vertigo co - stars Stewart ( in his last turn as a romantic lead ) and Novak elevate this , Stewart 's other " Christmas movie , " movie to above mid - level entertainment . The chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people 's relationships . All in all , a nice diversion with legendary stars , 7/10 .
1 This is the kind of film that , if it were made today , it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant ; actually , now that I think about it , this one is quite liable to be remade one day . It 's pleasant , but with no depth whatsoever . It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for , and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak . Ernie Kovacs , in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer , is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call " wit " . ( * * 1/2 )
1 Kim Novak 's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover , and James Stewart 's her choice . Scintillating comedy of manners , from the Broadway stage ; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color , and performed by a sterling cast . Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer Redlitch . I love this movie , though few others seem to . Kim alone makes it a winner in my Book . Ha ! My # 5 film of 1958 .
1 This impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man , in a mortal world . Her " community " is open among it 's members , but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals . Hmmmm ... this is starting to sound familiar . LOL . It 's not your typical movie . Very " campy " performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting dull . Kim Novak is always a pleasure on screen , but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual ( but not fatal to the story).<br /><br />With re - newed interest in all things witchy and dark , this film deserves to be discovered and re - discovered by old and new audiences ...... IT 'S STILL A HOOT !
1 this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story . the obvious inspiration behind the successful TV series " Bewitched , " this lovely sweet rom - com is a timeless treasure . the comparisons are obvious . jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid " straight . " kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell . but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch , she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket ( her feline familiar ) is being cared for by her beloved aunt . you 'll recognize the aunt from " Murder by Death . " this movie is fun and touchingly sweet , bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel . worth a look .
1 Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart , Kim Novak , Jack Lemmon . and Ernie Kovaks . This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second on - screen pairing ( after the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo , released earlier the same year ) . This was Stewart 's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore . The movie is about a witch played by Kim Novak who is attracted to a mortal played by James Stewart . She puts a spell on him and he falls head over heels in love with her . I enjoyed the movie and its cast . This movie at the time was a moderate success which was nominated for a Golden Globe for best Movie Comedy . GimmeClassics
1 The 1960 's TV series Bewitched owes it 's idea from this movie . This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock . This one is not as obsessive as that one but Novak is just as captivating.<br /><br />This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs . The movie has a lot of good things about it . Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie , almost as good in support here as she was in The Music Man . The cast is very solid.<br /><br />This movie has a late 1950 's New York City feel & a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie . It is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any , & a little magic too boot.<br /><br />It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie , viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that William Asher saw it , so that the 1960 's series got created . I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen , this movie is much better than that .
1 A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak . She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released . I think that the difference did n't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo , but it does matter for a romantic comedy . We can easily understand , that is , why his character would be attracted to hers , but it 's less clear why hers would be attracted to his.<br /><br />Still , the movie works as a light romantic fantasy . The scene where she stares at him across the cat 's head , with her dark painted - on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring , is true magic . It 's a little jarring , therefore , when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building , and we see the age difference very sharply . As he embraces her , she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair , but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee .
1 I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters . I knew of them , but that was all . This movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage . What a pair . What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms . This is not only a movie for African Americans , but for all Americans . It is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography . The acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years . Both sisters are quite different from each other . They came from a very loving and very strict family with high , maybe even impossible standards of perfection . It is sad to see how Sadie 's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding . I thoroughly recommend this movie and I am glad I caught it on television the other day .
1 The autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart - rending books I have ever read . It tells the amazing stories of two sisters , both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70 's as a teacher and a dentist , then lived another 30 years with dignity . Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious " blacker " Bessie , the dentist . She not only expresses her anger , angst , and wisdom well ; she lets you know exactly where they 've come from using an economy of words . Diahnn Carroll has the feel of the older sister , the teacher , down perfectly , but I 'm afraid she never makes me believe that she 's over 100 . No matter -- the stories are well worth telling . Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times reporter . This , too , is only a minor distraction . The stories , all true , are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation , most of them make it through just fine.<br /><br />I recommend the book as essential reading to all people I recommend any books to . I can not quite but this TV - movie in that rarefied air , but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right .
1 A powerful adaptation of the best - selling book and the smash Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany , two " colored " sisters who lived past the age of 100 . Wonderfully played in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll , respectively , they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth ( played by Amy Madigan ) , a white New York Times reporter . The flashback and present - day scenes do n't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book , but really are powerful . However , certain aspects of the sisters ' lives , such as the inter - racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father 's stern personality are not presented clearly . You need to read the book to fully understand these things . Which is just as well , because the book 's just as great ! Aside from those flaws , it 's wonderfully done and performed , especially by Dee and Carroll , and a very powerful and educational movie .
1 A wonderful film version of the best - selling book and smash Broadway play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany , two African - American sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of American history . Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bessie and Sadie , respectively . Amy Madigan also is good as Amy Hill Hearth , the white New York Times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book , etc . Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present - day ones are very powerful , if not quite as inspirational as in the book . That is the only real drawback , combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly , such as the inter - racial background of the sisters ' mother and why their father was so stern . But other than that , a very well - done , excellently performed , powerful movie .
1 This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects . Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent century.<br /><br />This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people , not white , black , etc.<br /><br />Good movie with a good message .
1 After " Beau travail " , everybody was waiting for Claire Denis to make a follow - up masterpiece that never arrived . Now it has . Denis makes a quantum leap in this film , an orgy of gorgeous cinematography , elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger . There 's a nominal plot ( derived partly from the Jean - Luc Nancy book of the same name ) about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a Tahitian son he abandoned long ago ; but mostly it 's an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural . It takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend , and has pacing problems close to the end , but it 's still more advanced and gripping than anything else I 've seen this year . Miss it at your peril .
1 " The Intruder ( L'Intrus ) " is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life . < br /><br />Grizzled Michel Subor plays " Louis Trebor " like Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past , living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons ( but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him ) . We learn more about him through dreams , flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not , as well as through his brusque interactions with family , lovers , business associates and a striking nemesis . Like " The Limey , " the film resonates with parent / child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man ( here Paul Gégauff 's 1965 adventure film " Le Reflux").<br /><br />In a complete contrast of moods , we meet his son Sidney ( Grégoire Colin ) who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world , as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby , a toddler and every need of his working wife . Surely director / co - writer Claire Denis must have created him as a woman 's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay . There 's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch . He is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining ; no wonder he thinks his father is " a lunatic . " I spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes.<br /><br />The film is a puzzle , but Subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals , and the voice - over narration for Denis 's " Beau Travail " was annoying anyway . We have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to Geneva , Korea and the South Pacific . Time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing . There are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing . < br /><br />Continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization , as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the Mysterious Orient and Russian criminals , Denis has incorporated elements from Robert Louis Stevenson , Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando 's Tahiti idylls and a 40-page memoir by French philosopher Jean - Luc Nancy , the last for the title and heart - transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences.<br /><br />While " Louis " thinks he 's succeeded in being above boundaries , rules and morals , there is some amusement in the last act as the locals do n't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey , even as he again lies in isolation.<br /><br />Several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical , but strikingly beautiful , story telling method . The unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details .
1 Two things haunt you throughout L'intrus ( The Intruder ) : who 's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you 're watching ? The ending is so shocking that for a while you 're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions . The intruder pops up as different characters , different men in different circumstances who do n't belong in the scene , so they 're expelled from it , kindly or brutally , but often without emotional involvement . The main character , Louis , is a contemptible man . He 's got rough ways , some mean job and no heart . He needs one and goes after it . He has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life . Can this man succeed in his quest for redemption ? A guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat . You know it but Claire Denis does n't encourage you to judge him . Occasionally , there 's a young Russian woman -a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth - who does judge him . She may even punish him . But not Denis . There 's the character played by Beatrice Dalle who wants no business with him : do n't touch me , she says . But Denis lets this man be himself , films him in his self - absorbed quest . I do n't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it is n't the traditional plot basics . Whatever she films , you get it in the end . You know who 's " the " intruder , you know why , more or less , and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning . But was it a movie or a dream ?
1 Claire Denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story , that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will.<br /><br />Ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non - linear film is the older man living on the French - Swiss border , a man devoted to his dogs , who still has a lover , but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life . He has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him , but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to Tahiti via Japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a Tahitian women years ago.<br /><br />What Denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul , the vastness of nature , man 's interaction with people vs animals , etc . Much of the time the ' film ' does n't make sense , but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures . Life is sort of like that : we look , see , observe , integrate , process , and make of it what we will.<br /><br />In using this form of film making ( much as she did in the strangely beautiful ' Beau Travail ' ) Claire Denis has developed a signature technique . Whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information . This is an interesting and visually captivating film , but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little . Perhaps watching again will change that . Grady Harp
1 The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense . It does n't present a series of pretty pictures . Instead it is a visually interesting film . It forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots . This sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at . The film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what 's going on . Instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres . The trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness . I suspect 99 % of North American viewers will just not get it . If you try to pin down the narrative of this film , or the philosophical message , or the symbolist structure , etc . you will waste your time . There are none of these . The film only feints towards these genres and others at times . The only unifying force in the film is Claire Denis 's own sense of what fits together . There are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying Kant 's description of what art is , namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experiences under concepts . Film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simpler pleasure of understanding what 's happening . Most film is not art . Most film does n't come close to art . When a film does , as this one does , and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers , it 's something of a miracle . My on negative comment is that at times I find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it . The Tahiti father - son narrative , even though it 's not exactly conventional , ends up making things a little to clear and simple . It dominates too much .
1 The Intruder ( L'Intrus ) , a film directed by French director Clair Denis , is the liberation of film . It follows its own spirit across time , space , and character . There may be a plot , but what I understood of that I picked up from the description on the Netflix DVD sleeve . Honestly , it 's probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it , because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations . The film demands that the viewer think , but also taunts the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding.<br /><br />The human heart is the film 's enigma . Every image questions its role , its nature , and its form . The heart is the intruder , that of the viewer and that of Louis . Louis ' character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character . Honestly , anyone could 've played Louis ' character , if he or she possessed a wandering , willing , and comfortable heart . Yet Subor is the one featured here ; he becomes the film , his identity is inseparable from it . Many of the film 's images lingering in my mind revolve around his expressions , vocal but mainly physical.<br /><br />The Intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement , but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take . " Surrealistic " has been a term used in describing this film , but perhaps " quasirealistic " is a more adequate term . Nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality ; the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light.<br /><br />Watch the trailer a few times if you 're attracted to visual imagery ; see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom .
1 My take on this , at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than I may actually have been , began with a head shake : " Well , I ca n't summarize the plot , but it 's a really superb character study of an extremely scary man . " Then , slight embarrassment , I ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down , that is , from whom Trebor unwittingly gets his new heart . It 'd been my last film in a long , long day halfway through the festival . Maybe I 'd dozed . The better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming . Do n't know . Did know there was an O'Henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished . And knew it had to do with the heart , hence the quietly hilarious talent search . My plot - loss remark had more to do with intricacies of Trebor 's connections in France , his relation to the dog woman and so on , stuff I 'd been wide awake for . Denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director 's treatment.<br /><br />But I write these things too often from memory , especially festival films , films whose DVD I do n't have at hand ( Le Lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples . ) , and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions . Still , or already , L'Inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark - side superman , a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible , relatively soft - spoken , driven but patient , right among us . The scar , once he attains it , makes him , just visually I mean , in image , a sort of hybrid Frankenstein monster , mad doctor and creation all in one . The actual doctors are his tools . If he does n't extract and install the heart himself , it 's only because it 's not possible . He 's the force , always , the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself . What else is he ? To suggest that he 's us , the First World versus the Third , seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow First Worlders , on all of us.<br /><br />Denis 's camera 's eye - when it looks at things I know - goes usually where mine would , so I tend to trust her when she looks at things I do n't know . Snow trekking , too - fast bicycling , and forest darkness I 've known in small ways , but the South Seas not at all , so I made better entry into L'Intrus , both France and the crystalline isles of its finish , than into Beau Travail . L'Intrus is , for me , a very comfortable discomforting film . It 's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly , with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we 've seen the reality or not . A single image , Trebor cycling , his massive weight on the thin racing frame , the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires , the asphalt ribbon , the dark - in - bright - sun evergreens , cued me that the film would be linear , a road trip , a single will - driven thrust.<br /><br />Despite Trebor 's personal power , he 's a human failure . No matter who he 's with , he 's alone , though apparently he has n't always been . His body aborts life twice , first to need the new heart , then despite it . L'Intrus is tragedy . Trebor is hubris.<br /><br />I'm navigating perilously the thread of what I remember . Let 's leave it at that .
1 First of all , I liked very much the central idea of locating the '' intruders '' , Others in the fragile Self , on various levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical . In fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film : in the Swiss - French border where the pretagonist leads secluded life ; in the his recurring daydream and nightmare ; inside his ailing body after heart transplantation .... In the last half of the film , he becomes intruder himself , returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past . < br /><br />The overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic , full of regrets and guilts , sense of failure being more or less dominant . This is a quite grim picture of an old age , ostensibly self - dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside . The directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings . Some of them are mesmerizing , not devoid of humor though , kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize .
1 Films such as Chocolat , Beau Travail , and others have propelled French director Claire Denis into the top echelon of the world 's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film The Intruder ( L'Intrus ) adds to the depth of her portfolio . A cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss , the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by . Loosely based on Jean - Luc Nancy 's memoir of a heart transplant , The Intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective , impressionistic terms.<br /><br />Louis Trebor ( Michael Subor ) is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who , like the professor in Ingmar Bergman 's Wild Strawberries , attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time . It is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation . Though we see only one episode of violence , where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder , there is a sinister sense about him . He might be an intelligence officer , a foreign agent , or a hit man.<br /><br />Whatever the case , he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences . Facial close - ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation . He lives with his dogs in a cabin in the Jura Mountains near the French - Swiss border and has an estranged son Sidney ( Gregoire Collin ) whom he has long neglected . Sidney lives nearby with his wife Antoinette ( Florence Loiret - Caille ) and their two children . In one telling scene , he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic , but that does not prevent him from taking his money.<br /><br />When the film opens , we meet Antoinette , a Swiss border guard , who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband . When she comes home , she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongue - in - cheek if she has " anything to declare ? " Other than these three individuals , the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in Louis ' imagination . Louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film 's first half hour : a pharmacist ( Bambou ) who prepares his medication , a neighbor ( Béatrice Dalle ) who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is , and a young Russian organ dealer ( Katia Golubeva ) who he tells he wants a " young man 's heart".<br /><br />Relentlessly , she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind . In the last section of the film , Louis travels to South Korea in search of a heart transplant and to Tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son , one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen . His heart transplant , however , appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart , a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless , intruding into other people 's lives with little real empathy . The Intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by Stuart Staples of the band Tindersticks , reminiscent of the guitar riff in Jim Jarmusch 's Dead Man , and gorgeous cinematography by Denis regular Agnes Godard.<br /><br />Godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret : a heart beating alone in the snow , an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes , the baby 's expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile , colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship , a massage in a dark room by a mysterious Korean masseuse , and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck . While The Intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature , Denis forces us to respond out of our own experience , to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level . If there is any theme , a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film - " your worst enemies are hiding , in the shadow , in your heart . "
1 Clair Denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers , men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion , heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while Nénette and Boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of Marseilles , our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the French - Swiss border to half way around the world , to Korea and Tahiti . Again the film begins in mid stream , with Louis , in his sixties , coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness . We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence . Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby . Denis is in no hurry to move the action along , and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son , Sidney ( Grégoire Colin , almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache ) who rejects him as a " lunatic " : , shown as a dedicated father of two . There are many brief scenes which , while seemingly unrelated , build up an impression of Louis and his milieu . Ms Godard 's camera work is exhilarating here . The controlling metaphor is Louis 's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to search for another son , not found , and where Louis 's new heart rejects him just as Sidney rejected the old . We are accustomed to brief scenes in Denis 's film which are inexplicable : Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon ; a drive by shooting of Boni 's father and then the briefest of images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head ; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney . The implication , of the last two , is a rejection , real or imagined , by a father , kills something indefinable in a son .
1 I do n't think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes cinema on a purer level than Claire Denis . That said , I do n't love this , her newest film , quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece " Trouble Every Day " ( although it comes very close ) , which itself is one of my absolute favorite films . It it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it 's own good . Do n't get me wrong , the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it , but I think Denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility , and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow ( like that the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant , instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there ) . Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors she likes yet again ( Beatrice Dalle 's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance ) . Still , the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing . It is definitely very much a masterpiece in it 's own way . At least as good as Denis ' more highly - acclaimed " Beau travail " , if not better . Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point , better than Leos Carax even . Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really does do " Lost in Translation " better than that film itself does ( and I , unlike some , am a huge fan of that film as well ) .
1 This movie is of almost generation - defining importance to some of us born in the early post - war years in that ( and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house ) you almost certainly saw it . And the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you . It 's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days . < br /><br />It had a modern , space - age storyboard for the audiences of it 's time . The set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a Friday midnight show . It has hot rods and rebellious youth , but in the ' why ca n't they let us have fun ' way rather than the disturbed , histrionic rebel - without - a - cause way . All characters were identifiable to us - teens , parents , the old man , the doctor , the nurse , the mechanic , the boy , the puppy , even the cops - were sympathetic to us . We could relate to them all < br /><br />It had a singularly horrifying monster . It 's first victim is heard moaning ' it hurts ..... it hurts ' and we were convinced and frightened . The menace grows continually throughout the story . There are intense periods of suspense , colourful effects , a fabulous lead in McQueen , and moments of humour , both intended and not . It even had an almost over - the - top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying.<br /><br />I saw it in summer , age 9 or so , double billed with ' I Married A Monster From Outer Space ' , and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that I went back a couple more times before it left . Everyone I knew saw it . Everyone I knew loved it .
1 This movie is wonderful . What separates it from other 50 's sci - fi is the fact that the alien has no features , no face , eyes , anything , yet it ca n't be killed . I especially like the idea that this film does n't take place over a few days , it takes place in one night , lasting supposedly past midnight . It 's also scary that once the blob gets on you , you ca n't get it off . you 're stuck in it , as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body . My all time favorite 50 's sci - fi film , and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one . I can see why this rocketed Steve McQueen to stardom . All this and a catchy theme song ! How can you go wrong ?
1 The Blob is a classic 1950s B - movie sci - fi flick . You probably know the story : two teens ( Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut ) see a meteorite hit the ground , and when they go to look for it , they run into an old man with some weird ... blob attached to his arm . They take him to the doctor 's office , and then go to find out what happened . From there , the blob spreads , eating everyone in its path . The special effects are cheesy fun , as is the story . There are a lot of great touches , like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district . It 's no masterpiece , but it has a special place in its genre . Steve McQueen is very good . 8/10 .
1 The only notable thing about this film is that it was Steve McQueen 's first big starring role.<br /><br />McQueen 's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci - fi horror piece . Steve shows himself as the anti - establishment , hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence.<br /><br />Later on , McQueen would say he hated this film and that " he was the blob " . But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute , fresh and innocent . Would that we all had stayed that way.<br /><br />The plot is fast paced and although predictable , still an entertaining hour or so . And it 's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool ( and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor 's girlfriend ) . A close friend sent me the DVD a while back and it 's a treasured addition to my Steve McQueen film collection .
1 I look at this page , and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic . Sure , I agree to let everyone have their opinion , but here 's mine:<br /><br />This movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher , and should be seen many casual viewers around the world . Sure , it has lost some of it 's flair and greatness with age , especially in todays world of CGI effects , but that 's not why you should like it.<br /><br />You should like it because it actually is a scary movie , even for today 's standards . It 's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences , so do n't slam a classic if you have n't given it a chance . Watch it , but not with a critical attitude . Watch it to have fun , how it was originally intended .
1 I was n't aware of Steve McQueen in 1958 . I only knew that I was extremely frightened about going to see this film . ( I 'd been devastated by the movie " Trantula " at age seven . . . but I was ten now ) . The 1st scene where the Blob crawls up the farmer 's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater . But I stayed and suffered through each of our monster 's attacks . I felt such horror when Steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor 's office ( poor doc ) , and even more when The Blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience . . . so many in fact that IT oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors , too huge now to fit through just one . It seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential , and when it trapped poor Steve in a sieve - like diner , he seemed like a sure dinner to be . < br /><br />To say that the Blob was cold would be a modern day description , but in the end , better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids.<br /><br />I remember walking home that evening with my uncle Nick , trying to act brave . He knew I was in trouble , and when I got into bed that night I could not only feel the Blob in the room , but when I summoned up the courage to look down at the floor , there the red pulsating , heart - like hungry dude sat , waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom . It took months to recover . < br /><br />I'm 57 years old now . . . I 've made it.<br /><br />Of course The Blob was n't destroyed .
1 Who would think Andy Griffith 's " Helen Crump " ( Aneta Corsaut ) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past ? But that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers - battle - creatures movie , which might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows What From Outer Space . The Rebel is Steven McQueen ( who would shortly decide that " Steve " sounded less prissy ) , a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting ; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut . It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot - rodders , but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous , man - eating What Is It that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor -- and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left . But will the grown ups believe them ? Of course not , what do they know , they 're just kids!<br /><br />The movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best . The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously , with many a soulful look into each other eyes , and the " adult " supporting cast probably says " Kids ! " very third sentence or so . But the real pleasure of the film its creature , which is well imagined , well - executed , and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense . And although clearly on the cheap side ( check out those miniature sets , guys ! ) , THE BLOB is actually a fairly well - made film -- and there 's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure . The 40-plus crowd ( myself included ) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia , but that wo n't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole - milk - and - white - bread 1950s sensibility , and the film would be a great choice for either family - movie night or a more sophisticated " grown ups only " get together . Make plenty of Jello cubes for movie snacking ! Gary F. Taylor , aka GFT , Amazon Reviewer
1 No hidden agenda . Pure scifi . All fun.<br /><br />I saw the original on TV and was scared pretty bad . I was a kid : ) < br /><br />The original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which I saw and have forgotten . The original one , starring the great movie star Steve McQueen ( BULLET ) , is by far the better and only version anyone should see.<br /><br />The movie production is dated , but the fx used to make the Blob stands up the test of time . I was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord . 10/10<br /><br />-Zafoid
1 A meteorite falls in the country of a small town , bringing a jelly creature . An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand , and the youths Steve Andrews ( Steve McQueen ) and his girlfriend Jane Martin ( Aneta Corsaut ) take him to Dr. T. Hallen ( Steven Chase ) . The local doctor treats carefully the blister , and asks Steve to investigate the location where they found the old man . When Steve returns , he sees the blob killing the doctor . Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the dwellers , but nobody believe on them , while the blob engulfs many people , getting bigger and bigger.<br /><br />"The Blob " is a cult and classic sci - fi . It is a low budget movie , with many ham actors and actresses ( with the exception of Steve McQueen ) , awful effects , but also delightful and very , but very funny . This is the first time that I see this classic ( I had seen the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon ) , and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and sci - fi B - movies from the 50s . The film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " A Bolha " ( " The Blob " )
1 Absolutely the very first film that scared me to death . I happened catch it when my older brother(r.i.p . ) was watching it . It was on a black and white TV and not really a good picture but it got me interested . Shortly after , my folks bought a color set and , as luck would have it , The Million Dollar Movie was showing it one Sunday.<br /><br />I had forgotten most of the plot , but it did not take long to catch up ... and I got so scared I had a hard time sleeping that night ! I mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space , but you could not hear it , or see it ... and once it got hold of you it was too late . Even now , after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine . A true classic , and even better a classic that I have seen scare the pants off a new generation!<br /><br />Long live The Blob !
1 THE BLOB is a great horror movie , not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable , flesh - dissolving title character , but because it features a real societal message . It is , in many ways , a " feel - good horror film . " The clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast . The two romantic leads , Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut , bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings . They are misunderstood but very well - meaning young people , and it 's very easy to root for them.<br /><br />This is a pro - society movie , and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom , not out of some malevolent character flaw . Steve McQueen 's drag - racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings , but quickly joins in McQueen 's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees McQueen 's seriousness . In this way , a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.<br /><br />The authorities ' initial skepticism of the kids ' wild claims is proved wrong -- and once the threat is acknowledged by all , all conflict within the society disappears . This unification of purpose , and the validation of the " troublemaking " teens , becomes official when Aneta Corsaut 's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob . On any other day , breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent -- on this particular day , it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure . At this turning point , it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.<br /><br />This is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a " generation gap " but suggests that it is more imaginary than real , and that given a real crisis , people will naturally band together to restore order . " The Blob " is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of " Night of the Living Dead " ( 1968).<br /><br />Much has been made of the film 's cheap but innovative ( and effective ! ) visual effects . They are undeniably clever . A lot of the gravity - defying tricks we see the Blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated . The camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly " locked down " position ( the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that ) . These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned -- the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up . In a way , this was similar to stop motion photography , but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet . Even today , the effects are startling and bizarre.<br /><br />A very good film with an exploitative - sounding title , THE BLOB is a must - see .
1 I grew up in Royersford , Pa. The town where Jerry 's market was . I remember my whole family going out to watch the filming . I remember a guy showing the " Blob " to me and my brothers in a bucket . I also would like to share that my mother was in the movie . Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut 's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind . They payed her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past August . My mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister .
1 This is my favorite classic . It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia , PA when I was 13 , in 1957 , and released the next year . Then in 1970 , I found myself working the very same county as a rookie PA state trooper . I have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed . I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well , and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the " home of the blob " . The theater scene was in Phoenixville , near Valley Forge Park and it is still showing films today !
1 I have read many comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and or campy . The movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects . What would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget , locally produced ( Valley Forge PA ) Christian Shorts . Let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious . That fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits . For what it was meant to be , this film is excellent . I have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts , Blair Witch Project was one of them , that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot . BWP was pure excrement . The Blob , on the other hand , was well thought out , well scripted , and thoroughly entertaining . The scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy . The scene in the doctor 's office with the Blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece . Bottom line is , I love this movie . I challenge anyone out there to take $ 120,000.00 , inflated for today 's dollar value , and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the Blob . It just ca n't be done . PERIOD ! < br /><br />Thank you for taking time to read this review .
1 I 've seen The Blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's.<br /><br />A strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this . A strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor 's , where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass . The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger . When these incidents are reported to the police , they do n't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up . They finally believe them when the mass , now huge turns up in the town 's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming . It then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside . The Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes , which is its weakness . It is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the Arctic and disposed of there . But it is only frozen , not dead ... <br /><br />This movie has a typical setting for its period : teenagers and a small town . The Blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout.<br /><br />The sequel , Beware ! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of The Blob movies.<br /><br />The cast is lead by Steve McQueen ( The Great Escape)and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend . I 'm not familiar with any of the other stars.<br /><br />The Blob is a must see for all sci - fi fans . Fantastic.<br /><br />Rating : 4 stars out of 5 .
1 Most of the Atomic Age monster movies I saw on television as a kid- and some of them , THE BLOB included , scared the daylights outta me . Movies like INVADERS FROM MARS made it all too clear to us " small fry " that kids just were n't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the Homeworld ; THE BLOB just reiterated that fact . I recall , fondly , late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society . There was a summer , in the early 1980s , when a local science museum ( in Richmond , Virginia ) ran an Atomic Age classic every weekend . These were 16 mm films , and most were black and white ( and the projector was noisy ) , and the " color " print of THE BLOB had faded to a faint pink- but , man , was it fun . I dragged my mother along , and she enjoyed it as much as I did . It was there , at that science museum , that I truly fell in love with THE BLOB . The filmmaker 's intent was , of course , to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved , from the filmmakers to the " talent " ( the players ) , that made me fall in love with this movie . Corny ? You bet . Cheesy ? They do n't get any cheesier . But , man , what a movie !
1 This is a pretty well known one so i wo n't get too deep into it . The basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor . Human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid . It also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger . Nobody believes the teens ( Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend ) and when they finally do it seems that the blob ca n't be stopped . It 's really well done for it 's age and unlike a lot of other 50 's flicks the pace is pretty fast . The story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci - fi and monster movies . If you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from ' 88 as well .
1 First off , I had n't seen " The Blob " since I was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience . Pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today . And even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s " fear of teenagers " . But this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.<br /><br />Sure , it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world . But " The Blob " packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults do n't believe them . In fact , there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy - colored world . And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.<br /><br />To sum up , if you can take off your postmodern irony filter , there 's a lot more to love here than meets the eye .
1 I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand the other night , not knowing what to expect . I had heard of this movie , but never really any opinions on it.<br /><br />I have to say , I was impressed with what I saw . I was genuinely freaked out in some parts and I definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times.<br /><br />The Blob was scary looking . Now , I look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it 'll latch itself onto my hand.<br /><br />Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews , the protagonist of the film . I also liked the old man in the beginning.<br /><br />For a 50 's horror movie , this was very well done even by today 's standards.<br /><br />8/10 .
1 Some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something : DVD menu system . I tell you the people , I watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times . It was awesome . A cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was , which was the very beginning . Many times the sum and Bam ! I was hooked . Over and over and over . And over.<br /><br />"Doot de doot , de doo de dodedo . " And that 's just the soundtrack ! < br /><br />I is laid aside in the bed , curled up with my Vaio . The rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft . The cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me , is already rested . I popped in the DVD . I was mesmerized . Through the night . " doot de doot , de doo de dodedo." < br /><br />The Blob . See it . Steve Queen , two cops , and one girl in a dress . Two thumbs way up !
1 Old horror movies are interesting , plenty of screams , plenty of shouts , and plenty of humor to go along with it . " The Blob " is a classic in it 's own work . Steve McQueen(1930 - 80 ) plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town . Going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens . But when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky , he ends up being the victim , and Steve helps him out the best he can . When its up to teen power , this movie really provides it . I know most teens have had their hardships when they act up , when danger comes around , they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity . When the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about " The Blob " running amok , they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them . The oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day , and in my opinion I think it was JELL - O ! When everyone pitches in to stop the menace , the town is once again safe , thanks to good old cooperation . I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time , if you do n't like Jello , TOUGH ! RATING 5 STARS
1 I had first watched this several years ago on a now - defunct Sicilian TV channel ; amazingly , the film emerged as a heftily - priced DVD from Criterion : not being sure what I had made of it initially ( despite having attained cult status over the years , the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs ) , I opted not to make the purchase  as I did with the similar and , to me , unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE ( 1958 ) . Recently , however , I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which , interestingly , ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion " Special Edition "  but , regrettably , I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature ! Anyway , looking at the film anew , I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it ( despite many a narrative flaw , which I will get to later )  as a pure example of ' B - movie ' schlockiness ( atypically shot in pleasant color ) and a time - capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes . The male lead was an early role for Steve(n ) McQueen and , though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain , his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging : not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent ( and , more importantly , altruistic ) kid . The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period ; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster 's invasion of a cinema ( showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [ 1953/7 ] as I mentioned recently in that film 's review but being curiously screened ' flipped ' and which sequence , incidentally , would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called " Blob " ! ) . As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film : the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places , never being seen by anyone ! ; there is a baffling over - emphasis ( tantamount to padding ) on the kids ' scrapes with Police ; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob  as if fluid , whatever its proportion , can be destroyed by bullets ! ; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door - to - door visits ( especially when considering that , at that stage , only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action ) ! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB ! ; the original was then remade in 1988  I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me ( though I know Micheal Elliott loves it ) . For the record , I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris , namely 4D MAN ( 1959 ) and DINOSAURUS ! ( 1960 ) .
1 Sure , it 's a 50 's drive - in special , but do n't let that fool you . In my little book , there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor . Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who 's supposed to keep an eye on the doc 's place . She not only steals the scene , but darn near the whole movie . And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color , a wise decision , since the blob would not show up well in b&w . Yes , the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate . But except for several of the teens , the non - Hollywood cast performs well . Then too , the byplay among hot - rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining . Pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage . Apparently , they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with " juvenile delinquents " . Then again , the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department , but manages the hot - rodder attitude anyway . The movie was a hit at the time , helped along , no doubt , by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play . And except for the unfortunate final effects , the movie is still a lot of fun , drive - in or no drive - in . Meanwhile , I 'm awaiting the blob 's return now that the polar icecap is turning into , shall we say , refrigerator water .
1 I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start " Wanted : Dead of Alive " the same year this film came out , or be in The Magnificent Seven two years later , he would not have done it . But he did , and we are the richer for it.<br /><br />Sure it 's a camp classic . Horror the way it was meant to be for the drive - in theater . It 's fun and nostalgic.<br /><br />It is interesting that the last lines of the film were:<br /><br />Lieutenant Dave : At least we 've got it stopped . Steve Andrews : Yeah , as long as the Arctic stays cold . < br /><br />They never would have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would be thawing . The Blob will soon return .
1 " The Blob " qualifies as a cult sci - fi film not only because it launched 27-year old Steve McQueen on a trajectory to superstardom , but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s . Interestingly , nobody in the Kay Linaker & Theodore Simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous , scarlet - red protoplasm that plummeted to Earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of Downingtown Pennsylvania on a Friday night as " The Blob . " Steve McQueen won the role of Josh Randall , the old West bounty hunter in " Wanted : Dead or Alive , " after producer Dick Powell saw this Paramount Pictures ' release . Meanwhile McQueen 's attractive girlfriend Aneta Corsaut went on to star opposite Andy Griffith in " The Andy Griffith Show " as Sheriff Taylor 's school teacher girlfriend Helen Crump . Of course , neither McQueen nor Corsaut were teenagers , but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers . Director Irvin S. Yeaworth , Jr. , made his directorial debut with " The Blob . " Linaker & Simonson 's screenplay synthesized four genres : first , the alien invasion ; second , teenage delinquency ; third , a murder mystery , and fourth ; a horror chiller . Moreover , while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes , it remains largely anonymous . In other words , the eponymous Jell - O neither talks nor communicates by telepathy . Instead , it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody . The tone of " The Blob " is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature.<br /><br />As the filmmakers point out on the Criterion DVD release of " The Blob , " the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci - fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing . Jane ( Anita Corsaut ) and Steve ( Steve McQueen ) see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it . Meanwhile , an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick . The meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick . When the old timer ( Olin Howland of " The Paleface " ) gets a closer look at it , the goop attaches itself to his hand . The old guy runs screaming from the crater and Steve nearly hits him with his jalopy . Steve and Jane pick the guy up and take him to see Dr. Hallen in town . < br /><br />Hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when Steve and Jane bring the old guy to his office . Hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation . Of course , Hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man 's forearm . Hallen sends Steve and Jane to find out what happened . Our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule Steve 's fast driving . Steve fools him into a reverse drive race , but the local police chief Dave ( Earl Rowe ) lets him off the hook . Steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor . After they visit the old man 's house and rescue a dog , the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while Steve and Jane return to Dr. Hallen 's office . During the interim , the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer , killed Hallen 's nurse and attacked the doctor . Neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor Hallen 's shotgun have any effect on the blob . Steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing Hallen . When Steve and Jane go to the police department to report the incident , Dave is frankly incredulous , while Sergeant Bert ( John Benson ) believes that it is a prank . Bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car.<br /><br />Steve and Jane take them to Hallen 's office , but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody , but Dave admits that the office has been vandalized . Against Sgt . Bert 's advice , Dave turns the teens over to their respective parents . No sooner have Steve and Jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again . They drive into town and spot the old man 's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket . When they go to retrieve the mutt , Steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens . They find nobody inside , but they encounter the blob . Steve and Jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob does n't attack them . Later , after they escape , Steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed . Police Chief Dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket . Steve tries to convince Dave that the blob is in the store . About that time , the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers . Suddenly , a horde of people exit the theater and Dave believes Steve . Steve and Jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks . The proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and Steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off.<br /><br />The authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob . The Pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the North Pole . As the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack , the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark . Producer James B. Harris obtained stock military footage of a Globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo.<br /><br />"The Blob " proved to be a drive - in hit and Steve McQueen 's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum . Unless you are a juvenile , this little horror movie is n't scary at all , but Yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes . They never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination , so " The Blob " is n't without a modicum of subtlety .
1 This is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50 's ! I just love the look of the 50 's in general like the cars and the music . Anyway , I love the way the blob looks . I love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party . Another thing I love about it is that it takes place all in one night , just like Halloween II.<br /><br />When Steve and Jane are making out , they see a meteor fall from space . Inside the meteor is the blob . Whenever the blob consumes a person , it grows bigger and bigger . They try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster , but no one believes them until later . Can anything stop this blobby creature ? I highly recommend THE BLOB ! ! !
1 What the movie The 60s really represents ( to those of us who growled around in the belly of America in those times ) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . Despite the exaggerated , stereotyped characters , the genuineness of the issues remains clear.<br /><br />Not only were those radical times of change , but also very confusing times . Two basic things changed our world then : the 1964 Civil Rights Act , and the overwhelming influence of the media . Those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized.<br /><br />From chaos came sensitivity , from disorder came values . Bear in mind however , that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this ... they worked , they played , they watched the news ... and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities ... the Civil Rights workers , the Political Activists , the Anti - War efforts , the War on Poverty .... <br /><br />The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular , was well reflected , although the conflict between the general public 's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored ... and at worst , misrepresented .. Middle class Americans were n't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats , or disowning their wayward daughters . They were confused too . Let us not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers , and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the Folk - Protest Movement . There are no Beatle songs in the movie , or even any mention of them.<br /><br />I think if you did n't live the decade , you might not have a sense of what the movie is about , the overall picture is a bit dim . At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock . At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut . Roles were constantly changing.<br /><br />The movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . They represent the hippie child , the political activist , and the active military personnel . Dad represents the typical attitudes , and mom represents the voice of reason , tolerance , and sometimes compromise ... for the sake of peace.<br /><br />The Black family comprises a minister and his son ... disproportionately , I think . I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations , or else the film would have become a long , boring , documentary . Dad 's message was that anger produces bitterness , and bitterness produces chaos . It was clearly a message directed to today 's youth.<br /><br />We are looking at a unique solution to social problems , and also how issues divide us ... The 60s were unusual in that way , and only the Roaring 20s compare . In other words , this movie has a moral after all . In the end , it is our Collective Individualism that survives . Put that in your oxymoron list.<br /><br />Everyone was a God , a Guru , or a free - spirited genius in the 60s . It was a time of magic and madness . No one will ever nail the 60s down right ... it was too diverse ( this movie is close ) . At least we can say we are not ashamed of it , that we learned and grew from it , and that for once , a generation shaped and changed America ... for the better .
1 The 60 's is a great movie(I saw it completely in one night ) about the hippy movement in the late 60 's . Although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60 's are not really important in this film.<br /><br />The main character of the movie is Michael , a political activist who goes on the road in the US against the Vietnam - war . There he meets his girlfriend , Sarah . Michael 's brother , Brian , goes to Vietnam to fight(what a surprise!).He comes back from the war and changes in a " Tom Cruise Born on the fourth of July " look a like and then into a Hippy . His dad is a pro - vietnam war type of guy(what a surprise!!).Michael 's sister Kate gets pregnant from a Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love . The ending is very poor(father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy),but I let this slip away from my vote(the rest of the movie is very good ! ) . < br /><br />The performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant . All the main events of the sixties are in the movie , like the murders on JFK and Martin Luther King aswell as the big hippy protests , the summer of love and Woodstock ! Look closely for Wavy"Woodstock Speaker"Gravy(What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400.000 ! ) as a first aid employee at the Woodstock festival!<br /><br />In the end , the 60 's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade ! 10/10
1 Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch . However the movie greatly exceeded my very low expectations.<br /><br />It is so much more than just a representation of a century . It has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job . The different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch . While watching it I really felt that I CARED about what happened to the characters.<br /><br />I would also like to give endless amounts of praise to Julia Stiles in her portrayal of Katie , she was great in a way that stood out!<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone ..
1 Can any one help find out the title and artist of the song , that was played at least halfway through the movie . I ca n't remember what scene was playing . The words in the song are of a ballad . Some of the lyrics go like " It 's natures way of telling you somethings wrong . " It 's natures way of telling it in a song . " " It 's natures way of forgiving you . " Please Help me with this question . Thanks so much ! I have been searching the internet for days , I ca n't get this song out of my mind . So now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter . I wish I would of been paying attention to the scene , when it was playing .
1 I accidently felt on this movie on TV , and I was n't able to leave it .... It 's really an excellent movie which makes people learning about american 's history with the Vietnam war , the flower power 's time , the racism 's fight .... It illustrates the conflict of generation , of political opinion , of race which took place in the 60's .... I'm born in 1980 so I did n't know all that stuff before ... In france , USA 's history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts ! By the way , I think all the actors are great ; especially Jordana Brewster , Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell . Now I can see this film more then 1 time each day ! ! It 's really great .... what a shame it only appeared on TV not in cinemas ... <br /><br / >
1 I love the movie . It brought me back to the best time of my life . < br /><br />We need that time again , now more than ever . For me it was a time of freedom , learning , and finding myself . I will always miss it . There will never be another time like the 60 's , unfortunately .
1 The 60´s is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot . In four deliveries , we follow a north American family , with 3 members . But we do n't only see them . We also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend , an extremist student leader , and a soldier in Vietnam . The filmography is just extraordinary . In the first chapters , we see some shots of the Vietnam war , in between the scenes . The next chapter , does n't start where the last one finished , it starts some time after , giving us a little mystery on what happened . In general , The 60´s mini series , is a must see , not only for hippies fanatics , but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic .
1 Great , great , great ! That is all I can say about that movie , but imdb want at least four lines of text so I 'll elaborate . The cast was great ( Jerry O'connel is soooo cute ! ) , the music was great ( The sixties had the best music ever , imho ) , the historical material was interesting , and so was the way they made the actors of the ' 90s seem like they were actually there in the ' 60s . And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes , and that is the greatness of any drama . BUT IN ONE WORD : GREAT !
1 I can agree with other comments that there was n't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it was n't a documentary ! It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it.<br /><br />I agree with the black family . The scenes with them seemed out of place . Like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but I did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good.<br /><br />Despite it was n't a re - enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade . I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch .
1 Well let me go say this because i love history and I know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and Julia Stiles became my # 1 favorite actress after seeing her in " The ' 60s " and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history ! ! ! !
1 I lived during those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era . I do think it should have dealt with more of the Afro American issue but I think it cover a lot in the program . It was scary to sit and watch the riots on T V hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down . I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war . I went to school with guys who came back . Some had changed more than others and some not so much . It bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough . Live through it and then make comments . I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job . Thank you for a trip ( sad and good ) down memory lane .
1 This movie started slowly , then gained momentum towards the middle . However , the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak . The second part really got interesting , but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending . Playing football in the yard ? Really , could it get any more sappy and maudlin ? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the ' 70s . I wo n't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it 's anything like " The ' 60s . "
1 As I saw the movie I was really shocked to see what the 60 's was about . I know I may be wrong about some things , but it seemed like the 60 's really had an effect on people of the time . Some people said they would want to go back to the 60 's . From what I saw I would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome . But that 's my opinion .
1 I was n't alive in the 60 's , so I ca n't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period , but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience . There are some excellent performances , most notably by Josh Hamilton ( of With Honors ) , Jerry O'Connell ( Sliders ) , who play brothers divided by the war . Bill Smitrovich , a character actor who has been long ignored by many , gives a heart - filled performance as their strict father , who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside , while the other is exactly the opposite . All in all , this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience .
1 Sometimes you have to look back to go forward . The 60 's did just that . We need to remember the past . The past is part of the future.<br /><br />Great mix Gary J. Coppola . I see a great future . You deserve to be nominated and win , The 60 's best mixer of the year.<br /><br />Best mini - series of all times.<br /><br />Thanks Ursula < br /><br / >
1 I really enjoyed The 60 's . Not being of that generation ( I 'm waiting for " The 80 's " ) it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era.<br /><br />One major problem in the movie , however , was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families . According to promos I saw for the movie on NBC , the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960 's America . Now , I may have missed something , but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family.<br /><br />I really think that The 60 's uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors ( all of which are very talented . ) This is very visible at the end of the first part ( about two hours in ) of the mini - series.<br /><br />Very good movie !
1 The film 's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country ( U.S. ) . We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . Befittingly , the obvious of student v.s . teacher is present . But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships : male v.s . female , white v.s . black , and the individual v.s . society . But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s . himself . < br /><br />I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . It did not attempt to show how either was right , although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive ( quite obvious towards the end ) . The film also discusses sex and rape . It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together , for a time . Lawrence Fishburne does an over - the - top performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps . He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down - trodden with the industrious and positive . Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps , Ice Cube , and Jennifer Connelly . Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.<br /><br />Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . In fact , I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other , rather than some dry book , as the real education at a university . It is a life - learning process , not a textual one . I think you 'll find " Higher Learning " is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general . 8/10
1 John Singleton 's finest film , before blockbuster wannabees like the Shaft remake , this is a thought - provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters , each with identifiable youngster problems.<br /><br />What I liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks , a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social - economical problems and racism by whites . This movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist.<br /><br />The masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow . It 's not just about racism , but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world ( college ) , date rape , discovering sexuality and isolation . Omar Epps , Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each deliver fine performances , and the supporting cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a lez ( yay ) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums causing little riots.<br /><br />The only negative is the caricature of a professor by Laurence Fishburne ( " Peppermint ? " ) . Surely , plenty of professors are nutty . But they 're not as flat . The skinheads are also a bit of a caricature , but I guess they are like that too in real life.<br /><br />Overall a great underrated piece of filmwork , if you liked American History X you 'll love this one.<br /><br />8,5 out of 10
1 First one has to take into account the time period this film was made in . 1995 . Rappers were in it , and that added to the flair of it.<br /><br />Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and could n't , until he met and was befriended by Nazis . They took him in . Nazi 's are n't all this awkward , but like most gangs , they fill a void that is missing be it economic , social , emotional , whatever . Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly.<br /><br />Omar Epps was the hot shot track star , with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder . He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight , and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it.<br /><br />Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in , until she was date raped . She then found her self experiment with her sexuality , and getting involved politically.<br /><br />This film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism , people 's own perspectives come into play.<br /><br />I read so many comments about how there were no ' evil ' black characters but there were evil white one ( Nazis ) . So what ? Remy was n't portrayed as evil at all , he was trying to find his way , and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him . He was scared , it was sad to see him devolve how he did . He even says right before he kills himself , I did n't mean it , I wanted to be an engineer.<br /><br />Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men , Ice Cube was somewhat of an intellectual , and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug . They both showed no consideration at all for their roommates , and generally appear to not like white people very much . They were angry like the Nazis but not on the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness . Sorry if this makes it seem unfair , but are there really black groups like the Nazis ? No.<br /><br />People say it shows white =- bad black = good . Not true , the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police , which is more or less true in real life . Kristen was a good girl , her boyfriend ( omar epps roommate ) was a good guy , and even Remy was a good guy , he was just misguided.<br /><br />Omar Epps , Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters , angry and inconsiderate . Although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger . Remy 's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well.<br /><br />Good movie , well done . Like all movies that deal with racism , its a great piece to get a discussion going.<br /><br />I do n't think Cube and Busta coulda beat those Nazis though .
1 Of life in ( some ) colleges . Of course there were artistic licenses taken , but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges.<br /><br />I went to colleges in Southern California where the races pretty much hang around with their own . It 's funny because these are schools that want racial unity , equality etc . and I can honestly say , that it 's there . But the thing is when class lets out , or when they 're just hanging out waiting for class , they ( students ) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity . Is that bad ? Not really . Everyone needs a feeling of belonging . But like the school paper of one of the schools I attended once wrote about that , " we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them . " Otherwise you 're creating your own segregation.<br /><br />Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended . One time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations . Fortunately , nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young Caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering.<br /><br />I can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen.<br /><br />So is " Higher Learning " overly dramatic ? Exaggerated ? Maybe . Is it way " off mark ? " It depends on where you went to or go to school . The race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own DOES happen . Minus the Hollywood exaggerations , the race thing hit pretty close to home for me .
1 * * * SPOILERS * * * < br /><br />this movie always seems very exaggerated , until i remember that my college campus had a former - student - turned - Nazi - racist - killer - who - then - committed - suicide , too : his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith.<br /><br />look him up in the wikipedia- i added a few photos to their article about him.<br /><br />it 's hard to believe , but this stuff really does happen.<br /><br />i'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube , but Larry Fishburne , Kristy Swanson , Jennifer Connelly & Mike Rappaport were good .
1 This movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues . It 's full of emotion and the direction is done well . The storyline progresses very quickly , but I guess that 's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie . This is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy .
1 This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever taken in . John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . Brilliant performances by the whole cast , but Epps and Rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star 's career.<br /><br />However , as a college student myself , many of the issues that Singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . In a sense that , while they are issues faced on many college campuses , they are n't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . In some instances , it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . However , aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic , the film was brilliant and left me stunned , unable to talk , just think . One of the things from this picture I will remember forever , was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn 's character , " Knowledge is power , without knowledge , you can not see your power . " Brilliant , just brilliant .
1 Omar Epps is an outstanding actor . I really think he gets into his character alot . When deja gets shot he shows true emotion . He also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room . Omar is a very talented actor ! !
1 I enjoyed this movie very much . Kristy Swanson Omar epps , and Ice Cube were all great in it . The movie dealt with many issues , and I did n't know if I was going to like it , but Singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about .
1 higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background . it 's a subject most of us would like to ignore but we can not afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we HAVE TO be able embrace and understand diversity.some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is , ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our society.everyone involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher learning.sure it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps .
1 This movie came and went in the theaters . Due to the nature of it you can see why it was n't well received . It was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself . Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in America : racism.<br /><br />Plot / Story : Higher Learning is mostly centered around Malik(played by Omar Epps ) , a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough , and a stern professor(played by Laurence Fishburne ) . He befriends Fudge(Ice Cube ) as well as a gorgeous lady named Deja(Tyra Banks ) . Later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus . Remy(play by Michael Rapaport ) is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus . Once they impose their views on him , he becomes as racist as they are.<br /><br />Opinion : Higher Learning is not without its flaws : Character development is scarce , okay performances by Omar Epps , Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads(whose name I forgot ) , Busta Rhymes does n't fit in this movie at all . Plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché ' before this film so you know I did n't like that part of the film with Kristy Swanson . Other than that , this movie was n't half bad . Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps(even though I could do without the accent ) , Fudge was Ice Cube 's best performance and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused Remy . All in all it was one of John Singleton 's best movies and is one is one of the reasons I frown on the rubbish he puts out now . Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning , Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy , 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very pointless remake of Shaft .
1 This is the first movie i 've seen of John Singleton and he is a pretty good director . The movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them . Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work . He is friends with Ice Cube and beings dating Tyra Banks . Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with Jennifer Connelly , who is a lesbian , and is n't sure about which way to go . Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who falls in with a group of Neo - Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser . Those are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them . It 's a great film and it 's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie .
1 This was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues . It dealt with issues of rascism and class . But , it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself . This movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny . It also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society . What others think of you is not important . I believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it . The actors I think were able to convey each character wonderfully . I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was . At a just glancing look you would n't see how deep the movie is , but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie .
1 When John Singleton is on , he 's * on * ! ! And this is one of his better films . Not quite as tight as Boyz - n - the - Hood , but close to it ( and with much of the same stellar cast ) . This film was very well written , very well put together , and very well shot . There 's very little to criticize , and most of my complaints are superficial ( eg : where did Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff ? No mention of a rich background ... And why does n't Professor Phibbs have an office ? A professor of his stature * should * have one ... And while we 're at it , for an engineering student , hick or not , Remy 's a pretty dumb character - I 'd think that he 'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon).<br /><br />But that aside , the film was very sharp . A good array of characters and points of view ; and Singleton does n't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic , and he does a good job of interspersing the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides.<br /><br />Much of the cinematography was excellent ; I especially loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne each scene spliced together really well . Also the Malik / Deja scenes were really well shot as well.<br /><br />The dialogue was a bit much at times ; this film had a tendency to get * really * preachy at times , and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness ( we really did n't need the US flag with ' UNLEARN ' typed onto it , give some credit , we 're not morons ... ) . And to top it off , although * most * of the time Singleton uses melodrama quite well , sometimes it gets * way * too cheezy ( like Deja 's death , which is fine until she screams out ' WHY ! ! ! ' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene).<br /><br />But the acting , in general , was top of the line . Fabulous performances by Omar Epps ( perhaps the best I 've ever seen ) , Kirsty Swanson ( who knew Buffy could act ? ? ) , Michael Rapaport ( surprised the hell out of me ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls I though he was a one - role actor ) , and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * outstanding.<br /><br />Downside ? Jennifer Connelly was flat ; though it 's not completely her fault : her role was stereotypical and one - dimensional . Generic to the highest degree . And Tyra Banks , who had the role , was nothing short of horrid . She whined and whined and whined . Yet another in the long line of models - turned - actresses who failed miserably ( though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule).<br /><br />Finally , the soundtrack ! Wow ! An amazing soundtrack ( which is definitely worth buying ! ) which fits the film like a glove . Each scene has a twin song ( although the Tori Amos songs started to * really * annoy me by the end ... not her best work ) . Liz Phair , Rage Against the Machine , Ice Cube ... how can one go wrong??<br /><br />All in all : a really good watch , a really strong cast , great script , great film . 8/10 .
1 In this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot . It is actually nice to watch because Singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships . This makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for . In fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap . Definitely not a deep movie ( even if it wants to be ) , but better than an average college movie .
1 I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the top 3 movies I have ever watched . It has a brilliant cast , and an equally brilliant director . Singleton shows how life in University can be . There are 3 main story lines , the skinheads , the African - Americans , and the homosexuals . I was intrigued by all of the stories , but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about Kristen , battling her feelings towards another girl . The end was great . After seeing the movie 25 times plus , I still cry . I would have given this movie an 11 , but I have to settlefor 10/10 .
1 I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on DVD someday . The episode with Hilton 's eccentric genius brother , George ( played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne ) , is classic hilarity . It reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy.<br /><br />Mr . Cosby and Ms. Rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on The Cosby Show for many years and to put them in a more middle - class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists . < br /><br />The roster of comedic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn , Phylicia Rashad , and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius !
1 " COSBY , " in my opinion , is a must - see CBS hit ! I 'm not sure if I 've never seen every episode , but I still enjoyed it . It 's hard to say which one is my favorite . Also , I really loved the theme song . If you ask me , even though I liked everyone , it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn had n't passed away during the show 's run . Since that happened , I 've always wondered what the show would have been like . Everyone always gave a good performance , the production design was spectacular , the costumes were well - designed , and the writing was always very strong . In conclusion , even though it can be seen on TBS now , I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
1 Two dysfunctional brothers ( Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke ) get tired of competing for who is the bigger f***-up and who Daddy ( Albert Finney ) loves more , so they hatch a hair - brained scheme to rob Mommy and Daddy 's jewelry store so that they can clear their debts and start fresh . Sounds like a great plan except that this is a suspenseful 1970 's style melodrama about a heist gone wrong , and boy , do things really go wrong here for our hapless duo and everyone involved . Lasciviously concocted by screenwriter Kelly Masterson and classically executed by director Sidney Lumet , " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " uses the heist as its McGuffin to delve deep into family drama.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief , Sidney Lumet is not dead . At age 83 , he has apparently made a deal with the Devil to deliver one last great film . Lumet was at his zenith in the 1970 's with films like " Dog Day Afternoon , " " Serpico , " and one of my favorite films of all time , " Network " . He has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements ( graphic sexuality , violence , and playing with time - frames and POV 's ) into a crackling , vibrant , lean , mean , and provocative melodrama . One can only hope that some of the modern greats ( like Scorsese or Spielberg ) who emerged during the same decade Lumet was at the top of his game will have this much chutzpah left when they reach that age.<br /><br />Lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters . As the cast waltzes through finely appointed Manhattan offices and apartments his slowly moving camera creates a palpable sense of anxiety as we never know who might be around the next corner or what this person might do in the next room . Also amazing is how Lumet utilizes the multiple POV and shifting time - frame approach . The coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds Christopher Nolan and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seem like amateur hour.<br /><br />Of course , what Lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives . Philip Seymour Hoffman has never been , and most likely never will be , better than he is here . Albert Finney 's quietly searing portrayal of a father betrayed and at the end of his rope is a masterpiece to watch unfold . Ethan Hawke , normally a nondescript pretty boy , is perfect as the emotionally crippled younger brother who has skated by far too long on his charms and looks . The coup - de - grace , however , is the series of scenes between Hoffman and Marisa Tomei , eerily on point as his flighty trophy wife . Lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since William Holden taunted Beatrice Straight right into a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in " Network . " < br /><br />The Devil of any great film is in the details , from Albert Finney 's tap of his car 's trunk that wo n't close due to a fender bender , to the look Amy Ryan ( fresh off her amazing turn in " Gone Baby Gone " ) gives her ex - husband Ethan Hawke at his mawkish promise to his little girl all three of them knows he wo n't keep , to the systematic unraveling of a family on the skids , to the dialog begging for cultists to quote it ( my favorite line being the hilariously threatening " Do you mind if I call you Chico ? " ) to the excellent Carter Burwell score . " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " is the film of the year . If something emerges to best it , then we know a few other deals must 've been brokered with Old Scratch .
1 What an extraordinary crime thriller ! ! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival . It 's already my second favourite film of all - time after DR . STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.<br /><br />I do n't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions . A synopsis that I 'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers , played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke , are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester , New York . The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time ( before , during and after the robbery ) , and one key scene is repeated at least three times . Ordinarily , that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece . The excitement , the tension , and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed . By the end , I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up . I know that I 've used a few clichés in this post , but I literally was on the edge of my seat . I should mention that the non - linear storyline is quite easy to follow . This is n't the sort of movie where you 'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely brilliant all - around , and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting had n't been so perfect . A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke do n't look like brothers , but that 's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook . Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric . Marisa Tomei ( as Hoffman 's wife ) and Albert Finney ( as the father of Hoffman & Hawke ) are also very good in supporting roles . Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark , gesture and facial expression by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon  absolute perfection . The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I 've ever watched , and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes , especially the ones with Hoffman . The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie , often the same notes played over very effectively . I had the music playing in my head the following day , even as I sat through other films . In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph , there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable ( major spoiler , so I ca n't describe the scene ) . Otherwise , this film is pretty darn close to perfect.<br /><br />There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own . As an aside , the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage . Tomei did n't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked " Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera - shy ? " That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene ! !

1 Sydney Lumet has n't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight , well - cast , suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground , New York City . ( How he got insurance , let alone the budget after all those flops , is a mystery also ) . The story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene.<br /><br />Two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents . The only victim is going to be the insurance company . The robbery goes awry and two people die . Most of the film is concerned with the aftermath . The action is non - linear and seen from the main character 's differing points of view , but it is not difficult to follow . What is not so easy to work out is the back story  how did the brothers get into such a mess ? There are clues  the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers ' favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father , and vice versa , but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin - using murdering embezzler.<br /><br />As the scheming older brother , a corpulent Philip Seymour Hoffman dominates the film , but he is well supported by Ethan Hawke as his bullied , inadequate younger brother . Albert Finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that . Marisa Tomei as the older brother 's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance I 've seen in many a year . The film literally starts with a bang , but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly.<br /><br />I do n't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter Kelly Masterton but I suspect that like Lumet 's great 70 's film " Dog Day Afternoon " it is based on fact  it 's too silly to be untrue . Lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old - time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them . Some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys . This is n't a classic of either sort  it 's a well - crafted piece of downbeat entertainment . It will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one , but still wondering as to how they got that way . We do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys . ( There is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant ) . Well , like Tolstoy , we have to conclude that " each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way " .
1 Says Andy : " Nobody gets hurt , everybody wins . " Before he says it , we know the opposite is true : Everybody gets hurt , nobody wins . This is a new strand in American movies , or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last . Think " Eastern Promises " , " There Will Be Blood " , " No Country for Old Men " . These movies are dark , serious , extremely well made , and do n't care about happy endings . I love them . " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " fits the general description , but creates an atmosphere all its own . Kelly Masterson 's debut script is as close as a Hollywood movie will ever get to a Greek tragedy . Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen , Sidney Lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding , old school character drama . The opening shots , although of an obese accountant doggy - styling his trophy wife , have the look and feel of a Dutch master 's painting . By contrast , the drug dealer 's condo looks more like a string of Mondrians . Great performances all around . Only Albert Finney 's character Charles feels a little over - acted , eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time . But then he is in trouble deep , deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know . For compensation , Marisa Tomei is super hot . But of course you do n't need me to tell you that . Why her character Gina would want to be with a guy like Andy , we 're never told , but that 's okay . Action is character , after all . The unique and magic touch of Carter Burwell 's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece . Do n't miss it .
1 I am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007 's films . If 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films , 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales , films that portray , test , challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things . Although this identification is rather broad , I think that there are a handful of films released this year , such as 3:10 To Yuma , Eastern Promises , American Gangster , No Country for Old Men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery . Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead is a deviously stylish morality tale , and quite a dark , bleak and depressing one at that . And even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time , the legendary Sidney Lumet , who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller.<br /><br />It 's one of those films whose plots are so thick , that one is very reluctant to go into details . It is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold , as there are twists and turns . But the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film ; the true focus is , as I mentioned , the morality tale ; the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film . In a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both The Coen Brothers ( namely Blood Simple and Fargo ) and Quentin Tarantino , we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly , ridiculously wrong , and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy . And to make it all the more interesting , the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time . Sizzling , sharp , thick and precariously depressing , Kelly Masterson 's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded , in particular because it is a debut screenplay.<br /><br />But the film has much more going for it than just it 's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot . First and foremost , the picture looks and feels outstandingly well . Sidney Lumet has , throughout his career , consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting : naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time . The film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class , with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great . Editing is top - notch ; combining the sizzling drama - thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly . And vivid , dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style . The film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by Carter Burwell.<br /><br />The screenplay does its part , and of course Lumet does his part , but at the film 's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances . First and foremost , there are the two leads . Leading the pack is Philip Seymour Hoffman , who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading - man status after his unnaturally fantastic Oscar - winning performance in Capote . His turn in this film is fascinating : severely flawed , broken , manic . Hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out , and not just his subtlety and wit . At his side is Ethan Hawke , who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater , grander actors . Here , he bounces off Hoffman and complements him so incredibly well ; in all , the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing , the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it 's watching actors . And then there 's Albert Finney . Such a supple , opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here Finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime . I love how the dynamics between the three of them play out . I love how Hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they 're middle - aged men ; and yet despite this , it is clear how Finney 's father favours Hawke 's younger , weaker brother . Also on the topic of the cast , the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from Amy Ryan and Marisa Tomei , whose looks just get better and better as the years go by.<br /><br />This film is n't revolutionary . These themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of The Coen Brothers , and it 's very easy to imagine them directing this film . But for a film that treads familiar ground , it simply excels . Lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to Masterson 's brilliantly vivid , intense , and morbidly depressing first - time screenplay . The lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from Hoffman , Hawke and Finney ; but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a Lifetime Achievement Oscar , much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business , Sidney Lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful , resonant , intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years .
1 The full title of this film is ' May you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you 're dead ' , a rewording of the old Irish toast ' May you have food and raiment , a soft pillow for your head ; may you be 40 years in heaven , before the devil knows you 're dead . ' First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson ( with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet ) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes . In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but , here , very sensible manipulation of the flashback / flash forward technique of storytelling . By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale , we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong . < br /><br />Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is a wealthy executive , married to an emotionally needy Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) , and addicted to an expensive drug habit . His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money . Andy 's ne're - do well younger brother Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife Martha ( Amy Ryan ) , is behind in alimony and child support , and has borrowed all he can from his friends , and he needs money . Andy proposes a low - key robbery of a small Mall mom - and - pop jewelry store that promises safe , quick cash for both . The glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men 's parents - Charles ( Albert Finney ) and Nanette ( Rosemary Harris ) . Andy advances Hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that Hank will do the actual robbery , but though Hank agrees to the ' fail - safe ' plan , he hires a friend to take on the actual job while Hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car . The robbery is horribly botched when Nanette , filing in for the regular clerk , shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess . The disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when Nanette dies , Charles and Andy and Hank ( and their respective partners ) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn . < br /><br />Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances , and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman , Hawke , Tomei , Finney , Ryan , and Harris , it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful . It is not an easy film to watch , but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect , a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be . Grady Harp
1 I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew , but I rented it basically because of the stars . I certainly was not sorry . In fact , as you see , I rated it five stars . This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting.<br /><br />Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents ' jewelry store . The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family . Through a series of flashbacks , we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons.<br /><br />Younger brother , Hank is basically a screw - up . He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind . Hank is insecure , cowardly , and very much under the influence of his big brother . Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank " nailed to a T " and gives what is probably his best performance thus far . He shows us a man who is basically good - hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task.<br /><br />Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman , but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit . It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents ' store , and he gets weak - willed Hank to commit the act . Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays Andy . Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who , on the surface , is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath . He is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or it might be said that he , through his superior acting skills , made Andy the perfect part.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation . Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man , but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself . He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish . He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and Andy . As we get to know Charles and Andy , the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable.<br /><br />On a personal note , I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own father , and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself . Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant , critical father , a more successful older brother , and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home . Fortunately , my brother and I never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff.<br /><br />This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director , Sidney Lumet . At eighty - three , he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge - of - seat action that hypnotizes . 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead , but he has n't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered.<br /><br />The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead are harsh and unattractive , and this is definitely not a feel - good movie . However , it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which I thoroughly recommend .
1 Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces , like Network , Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico . But , he was not having too much luck on his most recent works . Gloria ( 1999 ) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting , but failed experiment . Now , Lumet brings his best film in decades and , by my point of view , a true masterpiece : Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead . I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet . This movie has an excellent story which , deeply , has many layers . Also , I think the ending of the movie is perfect . The performances are brilliant . Philip Seymour Hoffman brings , as usual , a magnificent performance and he's , no doubt , one of the best actors of our days . Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor but he 's underrated by my point of view . His performance in here is great . The rest of the cast is also excellent(specially , the great Albert Finney ) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars . The film has a good level of intensity , in part thanks to the performances and , in part , thanks to the brilliant screenplay . Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction , a great screenplay and excellent performances . We need more movies like this .
1 BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD starts off promisingly , setting up a simple heist that goes awry , told from varying perspectives ( in RASHOMON style ) . At around the hour mark , Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts ; it eventually morphs into a multi - faceted family drama , exploring the full realm of human emotions / relations , as the story comes to its chilling climax.<br /><br />As is the case with Lumet , he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star - studded cast , without any notion of over - acting or hyperbole . Philip Seymour Hoffman , in one of his best roles , is a complex , mysterious , and interesting character , and oftentimes dwarfs Ethan Hawke , who plays his brother , Hank . That 's not to say that Hawke is not bad ; in fact he is quite above adequate , in a troubled role that suits his style . Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance ( the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this ) . Albert Finney 's character ( Andy and Hank 's father ) is the most intriguing , and in my opinion , he deserved a bit more screen - time . Amy Ryan also performs her job adequately.<br /><br />BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is not an exceptional movie , but it proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the ( apparent ) twilight of an illustrious career . Many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here , not least of which involves the use of his characters . Infused with a killer script ( no pun intended ) , smart dialogue and pacing , and a decent score , BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a must - see . A truly underrated gem . 8/10 . 3 stars ( out of 4 ) . Should just enter my Top 250 at 248 . Highly recommended .
1 Sydney Lumet , although one of the oldest active directors , still got game ! A few years ago he shot " Find me guilty " , a proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act , if he gets the opportunity and the right director . If he had retired after this movie ( a true masterpiece in my eyes ) , no one could have blamed him . But he 's still going strong , his next movie already announced for 2009.<br /><br />But let 's stay with this movie right here . The cast list is incredible , their performance top notch . The little nuances in their performances , the " real " dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing . The ( time ) structure of the movie , that keeps your toes the whole time , blending time - lines so seamlessly , that the editing seems natural / flawless . The story is heightened by that , although even in a " normal " time structure , it would 've been at least a good movie ( Drama / Thriller ) . I can only highly recommend it , the rest is up to you ! :o)
1 The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil . The love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction . Two brothers , Andy and Hank , will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most.<br /><br />Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) and his younger brother Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) could n't be more different . Andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in New York 's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed . Hank , however , is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex - wife , his daughter 's expensive school bills , and endless amount of child support payments . A man who means well and has good intentions , Hank none the less can not escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it.<br /><br />However , Andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better . He has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears . The pressure of his life , and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up , have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with Gina in order to start over again . Of course , like Hank , he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it . How ? By robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run . This act of betrayal is where the Hanson brothers , their families , and several other lives , will be destroyed because of greed , pride , and fear . < br /><br />The uniqueness of Before The Devil Knows You 're Dead is the manner in which the story is told . After the robbery goes wrong , and Nanette Hanson ( Rosemary Harris ) who is the mother of both Andy and Hank is killed , the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt . We learn more about the motivations of not only Andy and Hank but also the reaction to their father Charles ( Albert Finney ) to the death of his wife . The relationship between Charles and his two sons , especially to Andy , is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men . Nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today by portraying Andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also , in contradictory way , as a man we can sympathize with . Ethan Hawke also brings Hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left . Andy and Hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions.<br /><br />Before The Devil Knows You 're Dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face . More than that , our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected . In what should have been best picture of the year , we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives . In other words , there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse.<br /><br />10/10
1 In New York , Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is an addicted executive of a real estate office that has embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) . When an audit is scheduled in his department , he becomes desperate for money . His baby brother Hank Hanson ( Ethan Hawke ) is a complete loser that owes three months of child support to his daughter , and is having a love affair with Gina every Thursday afternoon . Andy plots a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a Saturday morning without the use of guns , expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents , since the insurance company would reimburse the loss . On Monday morning , we would raise the necessary money he needs to cover his embezzlement . He invites Hank to participate , since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized . However , Hank yellows and invites the thief Bobby Lasorda ( Brian F. O'Byrne ) to steal the store , but things go wrong when their mother Nanette ( Rosemary Harris ) comes to work as the substitute for the clerk and Bobby brings a hidden gun . Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but she is also lethally shot . After the death of Nanette , their father Charles Hanson ( Albert Finney ) decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " is a comedy of errors , disclosing a good story . The originality and the difference are in the screenplay , with a non - linear narrative à la " Pulp Fiction " . The eighty - three year - old Sidney Lumet has another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director . Philip Seymour Hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with traumatic relationship with his father that feels the world falling apart mostly because of his insecure and clumsy brother . Marisa Tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy , showing a magnificent body . The violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Antes Que o Diabo Saiba Que Você Está Morto " ( " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " )
1 Tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called Backstreet that " tragedy is like another character " in the film . The same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up Tarantino- for Sidney Lumet 's best work in years , a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what 's at stake with the cast involved . Kelly Masterson does n't have a masterpiece of a script here ( it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end , and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount ) , but her script does convey character before plot , and in a story where the actions surround a heist it 's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat . It 's bleak as hell , unforgiving as Satan , but also absolutely riveting 90 % of the time.<br /><br />Chalk it up not just because Lumet knows how to handle a non - linear script where we see the day - to - day actions of character to character before during , and mostly after the botched ' mom-&-pop ' jewelry store robbery occurs , but because of the formidable cast assembled ( which , I might add , is Lumet 's specialty ) . Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups , and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool - proof heist : looting their own mother and father 's jewelry store in Westchester . Hawke 's Hank involves another shady character though , murders occur , and suddenly it 's tragedy on a Greek scale affecting the brothers and their father , played by a perfect Albert Finney . It 's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who , like in Dog Day Afternoon , are painfully human , flawed to the bone but only wanting love & /or things to be set right , and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs.<br /><br />In this case though Hoffman and Hawke are matched splendidly ; Hoffman has , until the aforementioned last ten minutes , a super - calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation , but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally ( i.e. with Finney or the car scene with Tomei ) push his talents to the limit ; Hawke , meanwhile , is called a loser by his ex - wife and daughter , ca n't pay any debts at all , and is called a baby by his own father , and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he 's not quite as flawed as his older brother , but who wants to pick a straw for that title ? And Finney , as mentioned , is spot - on all the way through , making his turn in Big Fish look like child 's play ( the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic , his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half).<br /><br />Also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two - timing Marisa Tomei , Bug 's Michael Shannon as bad - ass white trash , and Amy Ryan , Brian F. O'Byrne and Rosemary Harris making brief , exact impressions , this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family 's perpetual downward spiral . If it 's not as mind - blowing as Serpico or Network or the Pawnbroker or 12 Angry Men it comes as close as anything Lumet 's done since .
1 While the title " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " comes from an Irish proverb the film plays out like a Greek tragedy . It all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they 've gotten themselves into.<br /><br />The cast is well - assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers . Notable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other . Beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable.<br /><br />The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve . The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts . That being said , the film 's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy , through and through . All in all , a pretty impressive debut for first - time screenwriter Kelly Masterson.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet 's direction is well handled but I 'm more impressed by the fact that he 's still directing at over eighty years old . I was less impressed by the score by Carter Burwell but it is n't a major distraction.<br /><br />In the end , the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience .
1 Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense , and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children . With an A - list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman ( an Oscar - worthy performance here ) , Ethan Hawke , Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney , Lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs , but also family stories such as Ordinary People.<br /><br />Many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here . Instead of showing it in a linear manner , he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order . I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next . The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei , as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman . All the actors are totally engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually does n't delve in . Plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time , this is a rare movie that does n't disappoint for one moment .
1 The Hanson brothers - Andy ( apparently has his act together ) and Hank ( clearly does n't have his act together ) need money . Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family.<br /><br />This film delivers . This is a layered , full - blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing . As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare it to ' No Country For Old Men . ' While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills , ' Devil ' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace . ' No Country ' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire , while ' Devil ' is a bit more enjoyable . There is definitely less violence in ' Devil ' than ' No Country . ' The acting delivers as well . Ethan Hawke , sometimes wooden in the past , brings the jitters , sweating and the deer - in - the - headlights - look to the besieged Hank . Philip Seymour Hoffman , as Andy , has the film 's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor , who you believe can do anything.<br /><br />There 's really not much wrong with this film . It jumps back and forth without being confusing . Events spiral out of control , but the film never does - the writing ( from first timer Kelly Masterson ) , directing ( veteran Sidney Lumet ) and the editing stay as tight as a drum . In many categories , this is award caliber stuff , though maybe films like ' The Departed ' and ' No Country ' squeezed this one out of the limelight . If you liked those , you 'll like this .
1 I watched this film in a very strange way -- I had put it on my Netflix list and could n't remember why ( other than that I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it ) . Since the film has no opening credits , I could n't even remember who had directed it.<br /><br />As my wife and I watched it , I turned to her about 45 minutes in and said , " You know , I keep wanting to decide that I hate this film , but something about it just wo n't let me stop watching it . " Then there 's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors ' performances.<br /><br />It was only as the end credits rolled that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet film . And I thought -- wow . I 'm surprised that Lumet took on what was really a dirty , petty little story about really mean , broken people . But it 's a testament to his talent that I was so taken in when I did n't even realize it was him.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is really , really good in this movie . Like scary good . Put this up against Capote and I would argue the Oscar should have been for this film instead.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the narrative special feature with Lumet , Hawke and Hoffman talking about making the movie -- it 's entertaining and educational , with Hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master 's feet . Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors -- kiss their asses constantly!!<br /><br />There are a lot of violent , melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done . And there is an element of that in this film -- that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion , and when the smoke clears there 's nothing left . Nothing resonates on a deeper level.<br /><br />But Lumet has given us Network and Twelve Angry Men -- films that , each in their own ways , have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinema.<br /><br />This movie is n't at that level . But there 's something about it that lingers . And maybe that 's enough.<br /><br />My final comment is about the comments -- if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on IMDb -- and the depth and intelligence of the comments , pro and con -- it 's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film .
1 If I watch a movie and do n't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene was n't the end of the movie , it 's got to be pretty good . I 'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist . I watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end , then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death ( The English Patient , Shakespeare in Love , Atonement , Crash . This movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end . Acting is great , story is absolutely original , flash - back technique very affective . There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him , but I forgive that cause I see it as a homage to , rather than a rip - off of , Orson .
1 I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet . The best word I could come up to describe it with is insane . It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and does n't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end . Trust me , this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through.<br /><br />The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant . It 's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story . The acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts , excellent cast . I also loved the cinematography , it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film . It was all great.<br /><br />This movie is excited , exhausting and heartbreaking . It 's almost hard to watch but you 'll be glad that you did .
1 The beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing , but sit tight , because you are in for the ride of your life . The concept is compelling , with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story . There are fine performances all around , with Phillip Seymour Hoffman 's being the best of the cast - no surprise there . Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well . The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding . The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story , but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today , this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs . You will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film .
1 This is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong . A simple robbery . Pick up some serious change . Get our finances together and everything will be hunky - dory . Butmom and pop 's jewelry store ? No problem . Insurance pays for it all . No guns . Nobody gets hurt . Easy money.<br /><br />Older , more successful ( it would appear ) brother Andy ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) has a few minor problems . Heroin addiction , cocaine habituation . A wife ( Marisa Tomei ) that  well , he ca n't seem to perform for . His flat belly days long gone . Younger , sweet , slightly dim - witted younger brother , Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) with a few dinero problems of his own . Behind in child support payments for his daughter , in debt to friends and relatives , not exactly wowing them in the work of work , etc.<br /><br />Sydney Lumet , in this performance at the age of 82 ( ! ) , directs and gets it 99.99 percent right , which is hard to do in a thriller . I have seen more thrillers than I can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes , the improbabilities , the cheesy scenes , and the hurry - up ending . Here Lumet makes a thriller like it 's a work of art . Every detail is perfect . The acting is superb . The plot has no holes . The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself.<br /><br />Hoffman of course is excellent . When you do n't have marquee , leading man presence , you have to get by on talent , workmanship and pure concentration . Ethan Hawke , who is no stranger to the sweet , little guy role , adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we do n't know whether to pity him or trash him . Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age . And Marisa Tomei , who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity , manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy 's two timing wife . ( But who could blame her ? ) It 's almost a movie reviewer 's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars , but if you study this film , as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do , you will notice the kind of excessive ( according to most Hollywood producers ) attention to detail that makes for real art -- the sort of thing that only great artists can do , and indeed can not help but do . ( By the way , I think there were twenty producers on this filmwell , maybe a dozen ; check the credits . ) All I can say in summation is , Way to go Sydney Lumet , author of a slew of excellent films , and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos . May we all do half so well.<br /><br />Okay , the 00.01 percent . It was unlikely that the father ( Albert Finney ) could have followed the cabs that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail . This is minor , and I wish all thrillers could have so small a blip . Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end . We can guess and guess . Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor . Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out , and he just said , " Leave it like that . It really does n't matter . " And I think it does n't . What happens to Hank is not going to be good . He is n't the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life . He is the kind of guy who gets a " light " sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he was n't really a man when he should have been.<br /><br />See this for Sidney Lumet , one of Hollywood 's best , director of The Pawnbroker ( 1964 ) , The Group ( 1966 ) , Serpico ( 1973 ) , Dog Day Afternoon ( 1975 ) , Network ( 1976 ) , and many more .
1 The humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the Sunday School dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you 're dead for the Devil 's scrutiny , i.e. so the Devil does n't care when you 're dead . There 's no percentage in trying to Beat the Devil . The characters apparently did n't pay attention at Sunday School , and find themselves forced into crisis management , having eschewed crisis avoidance . But even a seasoned CEO would have difficulty managing these crises . Throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin ; when people are involved , the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable Sidney Lumet films . Until now , Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino .
1 This intensely involving 2007 character - driven suspense drama is like a big , juicy piece of Shakespearean - level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious , to - the - edge performances from his actors . Consider for starters - Henry Fonda 's lone dissenting juror in " Twelve Angry Men " , Katharine Hepburn 's delusional Mary Tyrone in " Long Day 's Journey Into Night " , Rod Steiger 's conflicted concentration camp survivor in " The Pawnbroker " , William Holden 's wintry lion in " Network " , and Paul Newman 's alcoholic lawyer in " The Verdict " . The list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half - century , and you can safely add Philip Seymour Hoffman 's desperately controlling Andy Hanson to the ranks . At 83 , director Sidney Lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue , and in fact , he revels in the melodramatic turns of first - time screenwriter Kelly Masterson 's thickly plotted script.<br /><br />The scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash . Woody Allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film , the oddly pinched " Cassandra 's Dream " , but Lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception . The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless . Embezzling funds from his real estate company 's payroll to keep his neglected wife Gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit , smooth - talking Andy is about to be exposed in an IRS audit . Meanwhile , his younger brother Hank is a mass of post - divorce , codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments.<br /><br />Andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents ' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there . The goal was for the brothers to collect the haul , and the parents to claim the insurance . Murphy 's Law intervenes in every possible way starting with Andy pressuring Hank to do the job himself . After some brotherly cajoling , Hank agrees to it , but too scared to do it alone , he recruits a reckless , gun - toting busboy to handle the robbery . By fate , the heist occurs on the one day that Andy and Hank 's mother is opening the shop , and things quickly spiral out of control from there . Although the back - and - forth storytelling technique is not new ( for example , Alejandro González Iñárritu 's " 21 Grams " ) , Masterson 's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event.<br /><br />The acting is pitch - perfect starting with Hoffman 's riveting performance as Andy , a Machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family . I thought he was great in Tamara Jenkins ' " The Savages " , but he is even better here . Lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable Ethan Hawke as Hank , imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill - planned move . As their embattled father , Albert Finney acts with his typical late - career bluster , but he provides the necessary foundation for the Oedipal - level complexities . Marisa Tomei is a smart choice to play Gina , as the actress economically keys in on the responsive , watchful nature of a small but pivotal role . The estimable theater veteran Rosemary Harris ( now better known as Peter Parker 's aunt in the " Spider - Man " trilogy ) has precious little time as the mother , as does Amy Ryan as Hank 's bitter ex - wife.<br /><br />There are scenes that border on excessive , especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers , but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable . After the disappointment of the cartoonish " Find Me Guilty " , it is refreshing to see Lumet in peak form here . The 2008 DVD offers terrifically informative commentary from Lumet , Hoffman and Hawke , all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout . Along with the original theatrical trailer , there is also a better - than - average 24-minute featurette , " Directed by Sidney Lumet : How the Devil Was Made " , which features on - set footage and snippets of interviews with Lumet , two of the producers and the principal actors .
1 ' Before the devil knows you 're dead ' is one of the best movies I 've seen in a < br /><br />long time . The acting from < br /><br />the excellent ensemble cast is incredible . Philip Seymour Hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he 's on screen . Ethan Hawke matches him scene for scene and Albert Finney simply chews up the screen . Marisa Tomei is , however,<br /><br />criminally underused , but looks amazing for her 42 years . The script is excellent , the story - line non - linear but easy enough to follow . Sidney Lumet , although not known for his blockbusters , has turned out a gem with this one !
1 Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema . I have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me , the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience . It is one of those films that has stayed with me , and I continue to ponder and think about it.<br /><br />Surely the DVD would illuminate some more of the themes and the film - making elements ? Which include : Sidney Lumet 's comeback movie , the time - shifting technique deployed in the storytelling , the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well , the masterly direction , the relatively rare focus Hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women , the under - presented , but nevertheless resonant Marisa Tomei 's performance , and , of course , the superb Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Phew ! Surely a masterful film . So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find no commentary , no behind - the - scenes , no interviews , no extras.<br /><br />Hey - distributors - sort it out !
1 Thank God this was n't based on a true story , because what a story it is . Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds , Before The Devil is a mesmerizing , jaw - dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable ( and sometimes is , even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout ) if it were n't carried out with such magnificent , overwhelming conviction by its stars . The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet does n't hurt either.<br /><br />The main dysfunction here is of a family nature , with the two majorly screwed up brothers ( brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke ) deciding to rob their own parents ' jewelry store , an attempt that goes pathetically awry.<br /><br />The story is told with time - shifts ( which are noted on screen , such as : " Charlie : Two Days Before The Robbery " , so no one should be confused ) ; some people have said they did n't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly , adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair , considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you could n't make a decent poker hand to save your life . Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits : one of the brothers is a drug addict , married to Gina ( Marisa Tomei , also excellent ) , who is having an affair with the other brother , toss in some monumental sibling rivalry , along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father ( a wrenching performance from Albert Finney ) , who has apparently caused him serious past pain , and you 've got a Shakespearean / Greek tragedy on your hands . Proceed with caution .
1 Finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen . Well , we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers , Andy ( played by Hoffman ) and Hank ( played by Hawke ) will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down , but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie . Hoffman is superb , as usual , and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really can not think for himself . Hawke might have been a little out of his element , but he played the part well enough . Add into this mix Andy 's wife , played perfectly by Marisa Tomei , cheating with Hank ; Andy 's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions ; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery . This movie will get you thinking .
1 My personal feeling is that you can not divorce this movie from its political / historical underpinnings like so many ( American ) reviewers tend to do . This is not about growing up on Main Street , USA . It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West . Just like the guys are torn between Esther and everybody else , and Esther is torn between the " Tovarish Joe " and the guys . There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito . I feel the movie is under - rated and it is too bad we have lost the director . Movies like this make freedom feel more important . It is not just " another Eastern European coming of age film" ... it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom .
1 One of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex Yu . Story is very familiar to people in ex Yul because generation after war used to live in the same way . People in the west ca nt imagine how political situation in our country affect people . The plot is in the 50",When Josip Broz Tito said no to the SSSR and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence . But , in a country were people did n't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything . The friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from Yu is still alive . They get together after all this years on Ester"s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood , before their went to the emigration and become successful people .
1 A sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is . The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels . It is n't supposed to but it does . This tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 Communist Belgrade is a heart warmer . It is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema . Obviously , 1953 Belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the Communist society is often portrayed . One can listen to rock and roll music , one of the songs played is the song " Hey Babu Riba " ala the title of the movie . But jeans can not be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess . Unlike a heavy - handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four . The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him , the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys , the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it . The boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed on his hands . These all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away , as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire . A great movie worth seeing again and again . " Repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody 's friend . "
1 A very well made film set in early ' 60s communist Yugoslavia . The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong , sincere and emotionally deep performances . A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives . Highly recommended .
1 I was intrigued by the title , so during a small bout of insomnia ( fueled by my curiosity ... ) , I stayed up and watched it . I then checked my TV listings and watched it again ! There is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when I saw this film- in spite of politics , traditions , culture , etc . , teenagers everywhere are virtually the same . The characters of the kids from Belgrade could have been transported to , let 's say , somewhere in the American Midwest during the same time period , and language differences aside , would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era . They certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations , politics aside : Music , sex , movie idols , music , drinking , sports , music ... As a matter of fact , much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970 's Southern California.<br /><br />This was a bittersweet story , but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable . The characters , especially the young actors , were completely believable also . I wo n't say this was the Yugoslav " American Graffiti " , but I will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's - themed movies .
1 " Hey Babu Riba " is a film about a young woman , Mariana ( nicknamed " Esther " after a famous American movie star ) , and four young men , Glenn , Sacha , Kicha , and Pop , all perhaps 15 - 17 years old in 1953 Belgrade , Yugoslavia . The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz , blue jeans , or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant , and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties . In the wake of changing communist politics , they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 ( the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film with some reservations . The subtitles for one thing were difficult . Especially in the beginning , there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all . Perhaps the conversational pace required it , but I could n't always both read the text and absorb the scene , which caused me to not always understand which character was involved . I watched the movie ( a video from our public library ) with a friend , and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers ' sense of invulnerability , idealism , and strong and loyal bonds to each other . There is a main flashforward , and it was intriguing , keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis - a - vis the 1953 cast , and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10 , and would like to see other films by the director , Jovan Acin ( 1941 - 1991 ) .
1 Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers ( Dick Powell ) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood . He stays at Hollywwod Hotel ( of course ) . At the same time big egotistical star Mona Marshall ( Lola Lane ) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture . In a panic the studio hires lookalike Virginia ( Rosemary Lane ) to impersonate her and have Bowers take her to the premiere NOT telling him it 's not Marshall . Naturally they fall in love . You can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself.<br /><br />The plot is old ( to put it nicely ) but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices . The score is good ( highlighted by " Hooray for Hollywood " ) and director Busby Berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive - in musical sequence ( with Edgar Kennedy doing his patented slow burn ) . Also Glenda Farrell has a few funny bits as Monas sister Jonesie.<br /><br />Still the movie is n't that good . The rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny . Lola Lane especially is just lousy trying to play Mona for comedy . Also there is racism -- a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there 's some truly appalling racist " humor " at one point . That 's probably what keeps this off TV most of the time . I realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today.<br /><br />All in all a so - so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs . I give it a 7 .
1 If you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated , you 'll enjoy D - war . If you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films , you 'll enjoy D - war . Otherwise , do n't bother ! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends . They really loved it and that made me feel good . After the movie was over , all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater.<br /><br />The CG is good . Acting and directing are horrible . Storyline is extremely simple . But , since the half of the audience was kids , they were screaming , shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen . This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been.<br /><br />It 's a good movie to take your kids to , but except for the final battle sequence , D - War is disappointing . I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much .
1 I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August , though the movie was not released in the US , at least , until the middle of September . Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early . I am in the US and just saw it today . I thought the special effects were excellent , better than the trailer . The story was non - Western , but I think we are all used to this from many other movies . It was n't at all hard to follow . The acting by the leads was weak , but other people were quite good . There was humor throughout , too . I rated it at 8 because I had a good time watching it , which is what I went for .
1 Yes , some people have said that this movie was a waste of money , but i 'm the kind of die hard dragon / world - ending / holy crap action movie fan.<br /><br />But if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good . But its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time , or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time . Though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me.<br /><br />The 3d graphics were pretty damn good . I mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were GREAT ! ! ! ! Big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had . The fight between good and evil at the end was , I have to to say could have been longer and slightly better , it was still pretty good.<br /><br />Now on to the parts that i think could have been better . The beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles . I mean if you do n't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a DVDer ... <br /><br />overall i loved the movie , but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well .
1 I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews I read before going . I went because I was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans . Oh and it 's from Korea which has put out some of my favorite movies . I liked Host but not my absolute favorite . Some of my favorite sci - fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste : Mirrormask , Stardust , Serenity , Gattaca , Willow , Matrix , Resident Evil series , LOTR , Stargate , Dark City.<br /><br />It was n't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great . There are some holes in the story but did n't really matter . I sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when I see summer blockbusters . The Korean legend was interesting , the reincarnation stuff was different , and I thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like Korean actors in other shows . Ethan's(Behr)hair looked so Asian.<br /><br />Yes , it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea , with its unusual quirky sense of life , intense emotions , and unexpected humor , can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre . Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future ?
1 I have never seen such a movie before . I was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie . I never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny . The story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them . I have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it I think its worth watching . I give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created , this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash . I mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like " the camera is in front of them " . You will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is , me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie , the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh ! # although he does n't speak English lol . If you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you did n't like you took for granted they are way better than this . This movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie DEFINES lame . The evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous , the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time . The evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want . The transition between scenes leaves you wondering did I miss something ? So many plot holes from scene to scene . I was laughing like crazy when they decided to " Escape To Mexico " to get away from the serpent . Hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from Korea ? interesting ... very interesting .... I guess hopping the border solves all problems . Another scene that completely stupified me .. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and did n't even know each other ... the scene was so clichéd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they JUST MET even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing . Anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light . Bad Hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this . In the end its worth watching you wo nt get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment , every scene in your head .
1 If you like Sci - Fi , Monsters , and Ancient Legends , then you will love this movie ! ! < br /><br />The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago . While the acting may have been a little less than desirable , the story line and effects adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like non - stop action , awesome visuals , and taste for myth and lore .... you have to see this movie ! !
1 maybe i need to have my head examined , but i thought this was a pretty good movie.the CG is not too bad.i have seen worse.the look of the creatures(and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake)was pretty cool.the action scenes involving the snakes was really good , i thought.there are some lapses in logic at times , and the story does n't always make sense.but for a creature feature , there are a lot worse.a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies , so it 's not wholly original.i think the gist of the story is original though.there is a bit of similarity to Godzilla(the Big budget American version)which liked a lot.i did n't like this movie as much , but i still say it was pretty good.i also liked the music.all in all , i think Dragon Wars is about a 7/10
1 This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship . As a man married for 26 years , I empathize with Patrick Warburton 's character : he loves his wife , but he assumes she knows that . I also enjoy his monotone delivery ; never gets too excited or too low . A nice ensemble of characters . This will be a nice addition to the Monday night line - up.<br /><br />I do n't know how David Spade will be in his role . He is best enjoyed in small doses . He also seems a little old to still be trolling for women.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series develops .
1 Generally speaking , the plot was much better than I was expecting . The laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way ; however , there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it . My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers . Spade , in particular , was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions , but his character comes across quite well in the pilot . There is is enough eye - candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them . Now , if the writers can just live up to what they have begun .
1 I really enjoyed the pilot , it was as amazing as I hoped it would be , if not better . Patrick Warburton was a riot , although at first i thought that I would n't be able to stand his character . Him and Megyn Price Had little chemistry at all , but hopefully as the season goes on they 'll get more comfortable around each other . It must have been weird for Megyn to go from being the star on her last show [ " Grounded For Life " ] to being a co - star . < br /><br />Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem really new to the whole Sitcom scene , but I think in time they 'll get better . David Spade 's character , to my surprise , was n't the whole focus of this pilot . The way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i 've ever seen on TV , but I think that it is just his style . It works for him.<br /><br />I think that couples , or even singles , will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions , that this show is about . All the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life , not sugar - coated like most shows.<br /><br />I hope for all the actors sakes that CBS gives them a chance . This show has the potential to be one of the best series , if just given the chance and time .
1 This would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of " Everybody Loves Raymond " . Warburton is always hilarious , and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection . David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines . After having raved over the British series , " Coupling " I can see from just where the creators of " Rules of Engagement " got their original idea , but this is not intended as being a " brickbat " - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart . But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series , particularly in the very difficult field of comedy . Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia , I can appreciate particularly , the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew . One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously " canned " laughter . Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series .
1 I missed almost all of the first season , but when the other shows went to reruns , I started watching . I ended up buying the entire first season off iTunes . This is now one of my favorite comedy shows . Patrick Warburton is the key . His dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time . David Spade is funny , but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way . I enjoy the other cast members more ( but not saying he does n't add to the show).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor . If you have n't checked this one out , give it a try . If you can catch the episode where " Jeff " goes to the sperm bank , you will see how good this show is.<br /><br />I hope this series has a long run .
1 The show is really funny . Nice theme . Jokes and one liners are really good . With little extra tuning it can become a very popular show . But the only major negative point of this show is the cast . David Spade does a great job as Russell , Megyn Price does a good job . But who the hell did cast Patrick Warburton , Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich.<br /><br />Technically Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show , which make viewers wanna watch the show . Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man , The relationship wiz ... with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship.<br /><br />Patrick Warburton - does a horrible job as Jeff , he is not at all suited for the role . He is like a robot , literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery . < br /><br />Cast is really very important for viewers to like it . The bad acting certainly will take the show downhill ...
1 My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film . It has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood , but even women enjoy the film and especially Hallie Kate Eisenberg 's refrain , " Boys are so weird . " It 's refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup . Boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly ! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend , myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out . We had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it . It 's clean and delightfully acted by a pre - adolescent cast reminiscent of the TV Classic " Freaks and Geeks " . We all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the " Freaks & Geeks " which did n't survive its first season but sold - out its DVD release . Do see it especially if you have boys and you 'll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety ! Girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say , " Boys are so weird ! " Do n't miss it ...
1 I remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now . I knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day ! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare . Was n't necessary . The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters ' first name , the fact that there is a bet , and a whole lot of worm eating . Oh yeah , I almost forgot , the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent . How the kids know each other , the number of kids involved , how the bet came about , the number of worms that must be eaten , the time frame in which he has to eat the worms , how they are cooked , progression of friendships , climax scenes , etc . , NOTHING is the same . But somehow , it did not ruin the movie for me . The characters are all enjoyable , and the film did not leave me disappointed . Word of caution for parents , there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when Billy 's little brother referred to his penis as a " dilly dick " . The embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us , " Does anybody know what a dilly dick is ? " lol . That and an occasional " shut up " is as foul mouthed as this film gets . My daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 ( and was holding the empty nacho container just in case ) but was fine by worm 6 . She and I both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience .
1 Pre - adolescent humor is present in large quantities . The acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept . Those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the " worms " are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the audience.<br /><br />Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlight , but the young Ty Panitz could get some serious time on screen over the next few years.<br /><br />Miss Eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery . < br /><br />The story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying , friendship , and fairness . It creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while recalling some " gross " scene from the film .
1 It started out slow after an excellent animated intro , as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop . Once the bet is on , though , the movie picks up the pace as it 's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm . We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son : bullies , helping others , mind over matter when you do n't want to do something.<br /><br />Of special note is the girl who played Erica ( Erk ) : Hallie Kate Eisenberg . The director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly , and when she is on - screen she is captivating . She 's one of those " Hey , she looks familiar " faces , and then I remembered that she was the little girl that Pepsi featured about 8 years ago . She was also in " Paulie " , that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home.<br /><br />Ms . Eisenberg made many TV and movie appearances in ' 99 - 00 , but then was not seen much for the next few years . She 's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman . Her smile really warms up the screen . If she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career ( or better ? ) than Haley Joel Osment , another three named kid actor , but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment has been in lately.<br /><br />Anywhozitz , according to my 8 y.o . son , who just finished reading the story , the film did not seem to follow the book all that well , but was entertaining none the less . The ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels ( How to Eat Boiled Slugs ? Escargot Kid 's Style ? ) , which might not be such a bad thing . It was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language , violence or sex scenes.<br /><br />One other good aspect of the movie was the respect / fear engendered by the principal Mr. Burdock ( Boilerplate ) . Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons . While he has one particular goofy scene , he ruled the school with a firm hand . It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work .
1 If you like films about school bullies , brave children , hilarious toddlers and worm eating , then How to Eat Fried Worms will appeal to you.<br /><br />The film is about a boy named Billy , who when arriving on his first day at a new school , discovers that some of his classmates have played a prank on him by putting worms into his lunch . The school bully , Joe and his " team " of friends start teasing Billy and calling him " worm boy".<br /><br />Billy decides to play along by saying that " he eats worms all the time " . Joe and his friends do n't believe him but Billy assures them and bets Joe that he can eat ten worms in one day otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants.<br /><br />The boys take Billy up on his bet , leaving the weak stomached child with a mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating worms cooked , fried , or alive.<br /><br />The film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it . For one , it portrays true friendship and how to accept people for who they are . It also shows you why some bullies resort to bullying other children.<br /><br />The film 's protagonist , Billy is a strong minded and brave person who all of us can relate to . It is easy to empathize with him as we silently cheer for him to reach his goal , even though we might not always agree with what he 's doing or the choices he makes.<br /><br />The children in the film are portrayed exactly how children are in real life and the film deserves a lot of credit for that . The child actors are the stars of this show , showing true emotion and feeling than most other children 's movies portray.<br /><br />Some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will , perhaps even teenagers.<br /><br />There are hardly any other good movies on circuit at the moment , so if you 're not in the mood to see snakes on a plane , try worms on a plate in How to Eat Fried Worms . It is a feel good fun film and not just Fear Factor for kids .
1 I thought the kids in the movie were great . I deal with kids in that age group , and I thought their behaviors were very believable . I did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5-year old . I did n't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie . < br /><br />I think Luke Benward is up and coming star . I would like to see more of him on the big screen . I enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in . Often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences . Almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie.<br /><br />I also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group . It is a major problem in schools today.<br /><br />The ending was quite unexpected . Billy 's thoughts on whether he won or did n't win the bet were very surprising . How he handled that situation was excellent . Too often today kids are not willing to compromise . The actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life .
1 After being forced to sit through some real stinkers ( Racing Stripes , Shark Boy and Lava Girl ) -- I truly enjoyed watching " Fried Worms " . For once , I did not guess the ending ! It was funny and entertaining and did n't resort to a ton of gross - out humor , despite the title . My boys ( 6 and 10 ) both LOVED it too -- oh and my 45 year old " boy " had a smile on his face the whole time . This is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents . The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life . " He is not stopping singing just to annoy me ! ! " Also , the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right - on with the way kids behave . Of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job . Have fun !
1 ~~I was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass~~<br /><br />I am a mom of 2 children , who range from 11 down to 6 . So I 'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many " kids " movies . This was refreshing for me . I have n't read this particular book , so I do n't know if it stayed true to the book or not . But it sure took the grossness factor to a high level . This is the story of the " new " kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids .... sound familiar ? Have n't we all suffered this one time or another . He has the little brother who he ca nt stand and parents that he is embarrassed about . What I enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out . The bully ( why do they always make the bully a red head ? My daughter has red hair ! and she is no bully! .. lol ) is well a great bully , who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother . It took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters ! Even the parents , great connection between father and son . All around enjoyable , sweet , funny , gross etc ...... Take your kids ! ! ! You will enjoy it as much as they do !
1 Watching the commercials for this movie , I was fairly convinced that I was going to loathe it . For one thing , it was one of those " loosely based on the novel " movies , which usually means that the book author saw the script , hated it , and refused to be associated with the film . Worse , the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ( ex : kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose ... and falls over ) . So when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the " must see " film of the season ( of course , he thought the same thing about " Cars " , " Over the Hedge " , " The Ant Bully " , " Monster House " , etc , etc ) , I was admittedly less than thrilled.<br /><br />But once at the theater , the film won me over for a variety of reasons . First and foremost , the writers capture ' kid dialogue ' better than just about any other children 's film I 've ever seen . A prime example of this comes directly after the boys ' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet . The boys do a lame , over - exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them , which makes it realistic since all little kids think ( mistakenly ) that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors . Then one of the boys asks , " Why did he say , ' alley oop ' ? " Another boy responds , " Maybe he 's crazy ! " and the entire group laughs uproariously . Not an overly witty rejoinder , but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious . As if to confirm it , my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on - screen ; I could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation.<br /><br />Another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying , sibling relationships , the new kid in school , and peer pressure / conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special . For example , the bully ( Joe ) is n't stereotypical ; he 's definitely bad but not pure evil , and just enough of his home - life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins . There 's also no " cue the dramatic music " moment where Billy ( ' Worm Boy ' ) realizes what a complete tool he 's being to his younger brother Woody , and yet , by the end of the movie , some type of minor transformation has been made . There 's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other , and very little of it comes across as corny.<br /><br />The only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous McDonald 's dance party in " Mac and Me " would scoff at . Why oh why was it put into the movie ? ? Did Austin Rogers ( Adam ) pull a Macaulay Culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills ? The entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on " The History Channel".<br /><br />Overall , though , this movie was excellent , and the length ( about an hour and twenty minutes ) was just about perfect . One of the best , most realistic live action kid films you 'll ever see if you 're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like .
1 I sat with my children as we watched this film . We all found it to be a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />When Billy goes to a new school , a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms.<br /><br />A bet is made and Billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else . From this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook , fry or bake the worms to try and get Billy sick so that he will lose the bet.<br /><br />Billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone , even the bullies friends.<br /><br />I wo nt tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you will just need to watch it to find out but I will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one.<br /><br />P.S. Let me add that this movie is not just for boys , I have all daughters and they really liked it a lot .
1 It 's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids . I felt like instead of a movie ticket , I should have been given a NAMBLA membership.<br /><br />Based upon Thomas Rockwell 's respected Book , How To Eat Fried Worms starts like any children 's story : moving to a new town . The new kid , fifth grader Billy Forrester was once popular , but has to start anew . Making friends is never easy , especially when the only prospect is Poindexter Adam . Or Erica , who at 4 1/2 feet , is a giant.<br /><br />Further complicating things is Joe the bully . His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting . He antagonizes kids with the Death Ring : a Crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you 're punched with it . But not immediately . No , the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade.<br /><br />Joe and his axis of evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos . Once discovered , Billy plays it cool , swearing that he eats worms all the time . Then he throws them at Joe 's face . Ewww ! To win them over , Billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms . Fried , boiled , marinated in hot sauce , squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich . Each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the " Radioactive Slime Delight , " in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism.<br /><br />If you 've ever met me , you 'll know that I have an uncontrollably hearty laugh . I felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his " dilly dick " hurts . But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting . Like a G - rated Farrelly brothers film , it is both vomitous and delightful.<br /><br />Writer / director Bob Dolman is also a savvy storyteller . To raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm . In addition Billy holds a dark secret : he has an ultra - sensitive stomach.<br /><br />Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective . With such accuracy , he draws on children 's insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas.<br /><br />If you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries , you will see that it is essentially about war . Freedom - fighter and freedom - hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars , only to learn a valuable lesson in unity . International leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from Fried Worms.<br /><br />At the end of the film , I was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me , looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed , " That was a great movie . " Great , now I wo n't have to register myself in any lawful databases .
1 it 's a weekend i 've been watched this funny film . and i really like it . all the kids are cute , who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking . it 's a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night , which could make lots of memories and laughters . Kid 's humor always work . nice acting as well . simple story but cool shooting . nice job for directer to find the kid 's way . when it comes to the kid movie , i think of " 12 and holding " . another one this year but differed aspect to the kid 's world , which is real and cruel . awesome work . H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood , which every kid and family need . p.s . Twitch , i think , is the voice of Nemo from " Finding Nemo " .
1 I really liked the movie . I remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book.<br /><br />I was kid - sitting for a boy and a girl , ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie . But happily , at the end , she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out.<br /><br />There were some great laugh - out - loud moments and the movie was not as " gross " as I expected it would be ... tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross - o - meter ... < br /><br />The only thing I can not figure out is why they had to have the " dilly " line in there that was done by Woody in reference to his private part ... that to me was the only shocker moment ( and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie ) ... I have no clue why that was put in the movie ; it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock / gasp factor ... other than that , a pretty good movie . Nice to see the " Pepsi " girl all grown up .
1 Saw this today with my 8 year old . I thought it was cute . I agree with the other poster that it was n't anything like the book that I can remember , but we still enjoyed it . All of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining . Billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day . If he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants . The beginning of the movie is set up to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and pukes at almost anything . Hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms . Good message about standing up to bullies and of course , a sappy happy ending .
1 This is a good movie , a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do . If you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book , you will be very very disappointed . I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school.<br /><br />This is about a new kid in town named Billy . He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets . Billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins.<br /><br />The acting is OK , probably the worst part of the movie . The kid actors over exaggerate on many things . They think it 's apocalypse if Billy does not eat the worms . Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job , though.<br /><br />The plot line is good as a movie , but it sucks as a book adaptation . I was able to watch this movie without looking at the time .... sometimes.<br /><br />Overall , this was a good family movie with some weak points . I rate this movie 7/10 .
1 I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie . There are a few differences : < br /><br />1.Billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days , not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm.<br /><br />2.Billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he 's eaten all the worms . In the movie after Billy eats all the worms , Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants.<br /><br />3 . Joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie , he does n't at all.<br /><br />Even though there are changes , this movie is still one that kids will enjoy .
1 Let 's keep it simple : My two kids were glued to this movie . It has its flaws from an adult perspective , but buy some jelly - worms and just enjoy it . < br /><br />And the Pepsi girl was excellent!<br /><br />And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh - darned hot , although she 's not in the film very much , so do n't get too excited there.<br /><br />Not that 's it 's really a bad thing , but it is the kind of movie you watch just once . Do n't buy the DVD.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Did I mention Kimberly Williams ? ( That was for the dads . )
1 So we compromised . This was a fairly charming film , I liked the art direction ( it felt far more " real " than most kids movies ) , and the costumes were n't too cutesy . The child actors were not bad to watch ( the adult performances trended toward cheesy ) . It was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying.<br /><br />I do n't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves , but it 's a great film to take a kid to . And since " Barnyard " was apparently attended by 100 + kids at the same time , I 'm REALLY glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of " worms " instead .
1 This is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good ! Even though some of the actors and actresses were n't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old ! It was funny , gross and just all out a very good movie . In most parts I just did n't know what was going to happen next ! I was like I think this is going to happen , wait I think this is going to happen . All age groups will love this movie ! In some parts I could n't stop laughing , it was so funny , but in some parts I was totally grossed out and I could n't believe what I was seeing ! I am definitely going to see this movie again ! It is one of those movies where it ca n't get boring . Every time you see it is so suspenseful . I definitely recommend seeing this movie ! !
1 " October Sky " is a film that will steal your heart , fill your mind with vivid imagery , and lift your spirit . The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first , especially when the film is set in a mining town , where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine . But Homer can not follow in his father 's footsteps . With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher ) , members of his father 's staff , and his friends , Homer attempts to make his dream a reality.<br /><br />Yet as in any true to life story , there are many stops along the way . Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines , where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock . With lit helmets and bent posture , they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness . The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work.<br /><br />Contrasting the mine shaft 's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend 's rocket launches . Underneath the blue bowl of sky , rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time.<br /><br />Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters . Homer 's father is a classic hardened man ... but he has a soft side as well . We see that he does love his son , despite their many arguments . The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well . Best of all , the film is uncomfortable . It does n't tie everything up in a nice bow . It tears at you , lifts you up . It keeps an air of reality , which is important in a film like this.<br /><br />This film can be considered a complete work . At first , I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer 's life . I did n't want it to end . Then I realized ... that 's what a good film does to a person . If it has done its job , you wo n't want it to end . And " October Sky " accomplishes just that .
1 1 . ) This movie was amazing ! I watched it while I was in the town next to the one where he grew up ! I went and saw the buildings that the story took place in . Overall , I loved this movie , One of Jake Gyllenhaal 's best ! ! Also- my favorite parts were the science fair , and all the times with his father . They were so sad , it seemed . Homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad did n't seem to care one way or another . That tag line is true . " Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky . " 2 . ) The way this movie was shot was impeccable , it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950 's . Dress was accurate and they had their slang down too . Definitely recommend this movie !
1 This is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today 's more hectic and loud films . It is another solid based - on - a - true store , which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes . Frankly , I do n't know but I liked the story.<br /><br />The story is about a young man back in the Fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else , including his father , does in this West Virginia town . The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father , which I think was overdone . I would like to have a little less tension between the two.<br /><br />The young man , still a boy , is played by Jake Gyllenhaal , one of his first staring assignments , I think . He 's likable , as are his school buddies in here . It 's nice to see nice kids in a modern - day film . The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper ( the dad ) and Laura Dern ( the kid 's teacher who encourages him all the time.)<br /><br />The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear . Once again : I wish there more of these kind of films made today .
1 I was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare . My comment ? " I am watching my Life!" < br /><br />Though younger , but only by 5 years or so , than the " Rocket Boys " I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole Science Fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind . My own tornado landed me in my own State 's Science Fair , in Physics by ' 62 , though our group was less successful in gaining the support of , for example , firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event , our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago 's lakeshore.<br /><br />This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us " UberNerds " of the late ' 50s and early 60's.<br /><br />We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country . See It !
1 This is a gem , a real piece of Americana for all that this implies . If you are self programed to resist " life - afirming " stories , just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe . And what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story , no need to nit - pick what details were changed to make a compact story . Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors , and the complex , self - conflicted , bottom - line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight . The simple minded comments , refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off - track , expose the limitation of the commentator , not the writers or the acting . This is not for the cynical , or the simple minded .
1 There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this : " The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he ca n't are both right . " That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual , which , in this movie , stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way.<br /><br />"October Sky " is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam , growing up in a strict , traditional family in the 1950 's . Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner . All of his friends , Quentin , Roy , and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else 's . Homer is not exited about that future.<br /><br />One night , while everyone stares at the sky , a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead . This is something new for Homer , and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming . From this point on , his look at life will never be the same.<br /><br />First , he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation . Flabbergasted at what he says , his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends , however , think that this idea may have some potential . After all , Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing.<br /><br />When the four friends start to test model rockets , and blow a white picket fence to smithereens , then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them , they 're forced to end their progresses.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish . All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here . Standing out in all of the glory : Laura Dern as Miss Riley . This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released.<br /><br />The characters are also extremely well developed . Not only to the filmmakers give clear , apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject , but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry . We clearly understand all of the characters ' motives and beliefs , especially the father , who is bent over on everlasting tradition.<br /><br />The film , unfortunately , loses some of its momentum at mid - point because of a silly , recycled romantic sub - plot involving Homer 's love interest and how his brother stole her from him . This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high - school movies , not that this film is aimed at high - schoolers . The actors stare at each other mindlessly , like the are in a trance . I put up with it without complaining in 1997 's " Inventing the Abbots , " but I have had just about enough this.<br /><br />But that is just a minor complaint . With an authentic looking time period , cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end , whom all hit it big with their dreams , especially Homer , this is the first great film of 1999.<br /><br / >
1 I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres . " October Sky " feels and looks oh so familiar . And it is . All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better . But despite it 's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood , this movie is winning and likeable at every turn . < br /><br />Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart , mind and soul . Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim 's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation ( " What do you call it ? You call it a miracle . " ) , Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale . While jaded townsfolk of their 1950 's coal town dismiss the event , Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.<br /><br />Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new . Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer 's ailing young school teacher . Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship . Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film . Perfectly played all around . Even Homer 's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion . Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking . " Myrtle Beach " says it all . < br /><br />A major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you 'll love this film or they 'll refund your money . For once , I agree with them . You 'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.<br /><br / >
