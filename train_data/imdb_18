0 Well , what can I say.<br /><br />"What the Bleep do we Know " has achieved the nearly impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as " The Postman " , " The Dungeon Master " , " Merlin " , and so fourth , it will go down in history as the single worst movie I have ever seen in its entirety . And that , ladies and gentlemen , is impressive indeed , for I have seen many a bad movie.<br /><br />This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts , alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer , abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti - depressants to survive , and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new - agy pseudo - philosophy . Basically , if you start your day off meditating to the likes of Enya and Kenny G , this movie is for you . If you have a sense of humor , a crowd of people who know how to have fun , and a sizable portion of good weed , then this movie is for you as well . Otherwise , stay away . Take my word for it.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about " What the Bleep do you Know " is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera , complete with pink heart effects , computer - generated sparkles across the screen , and other assorted silliness . Who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me . I guess this is what too much Kenny G does to you . The movie was permeated with cheesy GCI , the likes that you or I can produce on our own computer via over - the - counter video editing software , but never would , because it 's just way too ridiculous.<br /><br />The script was _ obviously _ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever . Not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief , but the " writers " felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information , or rather disinformation , which is what most of this movie was all about , all the way down your throat . Well , given the target audience , that may not have been too bad of an idea . The main character , for example , spends half the movie popping pills . Apparently , though , it was deemed not convincing enough , so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout , which refer to her anti - anxiety pills specifically , just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down . The acting ... Well , I 've seen better acting in Ed Wood movies , and no , this is not an exaggeration . Heck , the little play I was in when I was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this . It really did.<br /><br />The story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads , a strange mix of kooky scientists , kooky doctors , and self - proclaimed mystics , go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an " explanation " for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life . Reality , you see , is a probability - field of a bunch of different possibilities , and is only set in stone once you the Observer chose to notice it . What happens when more than one Observer Observes they did n't say , but then again who cares . Listen to Enya , meditate , Observe , and you shall be God , and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking , logic , etc . All reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a " paradigm shift " and " go down the rabbit hole " . Furthermore , the Heidelberg Uncertainty Principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities , parallel universes , and such.<br /><br />Speaking of rabbit holes , the analogy permeates the movie . All of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes . I 'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing , but one thing I 'm certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex . Actually , the movie is _ extremely _ anti - sex . Throughout , sex is presented as dirty , ugly , and anti - enlightening.<br /><br />In any case , the talking heads talk , the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker , and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with.<br /><br />I want 2 hours of my life back.<br /><br />Here 's a couple of random quotes which I happened to remember:<br /><br />"What I think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me , and that , which I used to consider real , is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal . " - Some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics.<br /><br />"What does it take for one man to have an erection ? It takes just one thought . Nothing changes on the outside , all the changes are within . An yet he has an erection " - Some self proclaimed mystic , head of her own school of enlightenment.<br /><br />[while looking at herself in the mirror ] " I hate you ! I hate you ! You 're fat ! You 're ugly ! I have you ! " - main character , the fat and ugly photographer .
0 If you 're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory , read " The Elegant Universe " by Brian Greene of Columbia University , and " The Universe in a Nutshell " by Stephen Hawking of Cambridge.<br /><br />Recipe for # $ * ! : < br /><br />3 parts bombastic New Age pontificator , 2 parts pseudoscientist , 2 parts real scientist < br /><br />Mix together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance.<br /><br />Serving suggestion : barf bags .
0 I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie , but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent " Short History of Nearly Everything " and what I was able to choke down in " A Brief History of Time , " it sounded interesting at times . However , the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous . I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point , but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually " channelling " some loony named " Ramtha " completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What a waste of two hours .
0 A definite no . A resounding NO . This movie is an absolute dud.<br /><br />Having been recommended to me by a friend very much into " that sort of thing , " I watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed , changed , moved , altered , uplifted , and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when I suddenly see The Truth . Now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo - pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical , the metaphysical / physical boundaries of existence . Believe me , I am not such a person . I try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.<br /><br />In terms of content , the only thing I found mildly interesting and informative , was the bit about peptides , emotions , addiction , and cellular receptors . That was the only " unifying " element I could find in the documentary part of this film . The rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere , try to tie up and conclude to a point . And what was all that stuff about native Americans not being able to see the ships that Columbus came in ? Who told the " authorities " in this film that that was what happened in 1492 ? Where they there too ? Had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition ( the famous gorilla video , for example , visit the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois site ) there may have been a more convincing point made . Here , however , it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo - jumbo.<br /><br />As a film : this was n't one film , it was two . I found the documentary part mildly interesting , just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about ( I was annoyed that their credentials were n't presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke , at least initially ! ) But I found the " story " part of the movie with Matlin in it annoying , disjointed , intrusive , non - related and downright stupid . That bit about the Polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny . It was laughable , ludicrous , sophomoric , and stupid . And I found the use of the word " Pollack " offensive . It just seemed so out of place and wrong . Is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group ? That may be okay to make a point , but it did n't seem to be used that way here . And in any case , I do n't care what the reason , it offended me , a Pole . I never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as " Pollack . " And I certainly do n't like like it when others do . Can I watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used ? You betcha ! But again this did n't seem to be the case here . It just seemed so out of place . Unprovocked , unmitigated.<br /><br />The acting was abysmal . Elaine Hendrix 's performance was totally unbelievable . At times , it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her . Marlee Matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing . Perhaps she was baffled by the material . I know I was . If she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged - up anxiety - prone malcontent , it just did n't seem to click . But by far , the world 's worst was Hendrix ! All in all , I found this a disjointed , poorly acted piece of clap - trap .
0 If you want to see intelligent , philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential , watch " Waking Life , " which is brilliant . " What the # $ * ! Do We Know " is all over the place in its focus , poorly directed , poorly written , poorly acted , utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying . It was n't thought - provoking or entertaining in the slightest . The inclusion of that rambling freak " Ramtha " in this film is reason enough to avoid it . Is n't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something ? What a flake that old chick is , and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was . The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again .
0 If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics , spend your $ 9 on a used textbook , not this movie . I 'm a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool - Aid for shipment to Guyana . < br /><br />I do n't think the directors really got any point across , but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several : 1 ) Science can explain everything we do , meaning that our lives are deterministic ; 2 ) Science ca n't be used to explain everything we do , meaning that we have free will ; 3 ) Science is , like , really cool , brother ; 4 ) We are God ; 5 ) The world exists only in our minds ; 6 ) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow and 7 ) here , put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you 'll see some really groovy stuff .
0 Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion / philosophy . The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Examples ? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion . How ? Well , in the world of the subatomic , you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time . You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time . Also , the act of observation seems to affect the event . Solid particles can pass through barriers . All of this , so far , is accurate . But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall , you could indeed do it . This is complete poppycock . Instead , the theory asserts that at our level , it is possible for you to walk through a wall , but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief . Also you 'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall , the odds are so astronomically against it.<br /><br />This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science . But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer , played by Marlee Maitlan . About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible . Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self - hate . There may be some truth to that , but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Plus , string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays . Instead of wasting your time with this dreck , I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe , an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hour - long episodes . Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation .
0 I 'm still trying to decide if this is indeed , the worst film I have ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed , but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many BSers who populate this film . The BS to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one - at the end , the interviewees seem to be saying , " We want you to _ think _ ! ! " , but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact.<br /><br />If you feel that you are open - minded , and wish to expand your consciousness , please be open - minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory : " Einstein 's Universe " , Nigel Calder ( a slim volume , not a challenge ) , " The Cosmic Code " , by Heinz Pagels . If you ca n't bring yourself to read a book , please do n't complain to reviewers about being " open - minded".<br /><br />To recap , this film is just unbelievably bad.<br /><br />You know what 's a really good film which questions the nature of reality ? " Thirteenth Floor " , directed by Roland Emmerich , with Craig Bierko , Gretchen Mol , Vincent D'onofrio . Smart , sexy , thought - provoking .
0 " What the Bleep Do We Know ! ? " was one of the worst times I have spent at the movies . It was less of a movie and more of an after school special , but at the same time nothing special at all . The attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic , which almost anyone will tell you . Marlee Matlin in her underwear just should n't happen . I wo n't dwell on it . What I will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate . This movie , while tedious , also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning . It was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative , become a creator of your life , manifestation of abundance , shoeless piece of propaganda . Interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence . However , the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds . It completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us , which seems to be more the case . Or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us . In this way , the movie was inappropriately solipsistic . Solipsism and interconnectivity just do n't mix unless you 're God almighty . If you are , you will be impressed ( ? ! ? ) by all the neat things this movie will reveal that You can do . If not , you will be sorely disappointed , a moron , or perhaps both . Also , the title is so ridiculous , I have trouble warning people not to see the movie because I feel retarded mentioning it by name . Shame on everyone involved .
0 Another cult strikes again . This is n't a spoiler , because the REAL ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly - long , pseudo - scientific infomercial ... Ramtha 's School of Enlightenment.<br /><br />When any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ - like screen of deceit , I walk away . Thank Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a " friend" ... to have wasted precious resources on this New - Age lobotomizer would have been tragic . I can only hope that they " truly believe they can walk on water " enough to take that guidance to it 's " logical " conclusion ... in other words ; walk , drown ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong " 1 " on it 's entertainment value , especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history ( the photographer 's roommate ... eeeeeek ! ) . If you must see this film , borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it .
0 I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film . I found it incredibly silly ( at best ) and downright misleading , misinforming and harmful ( at worst ) . Like others , I found this film to be an awful mix of " real " science and pseudoscientific , New Age propaganda . < br /><br />As a psychologist , I was especially offended by Candace Pert 's contributions . True , I was not a fan of hers before this film , but her discourse on the " consciousness " of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ( " consciousness " ) that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify . It is an old Orwellian mind - f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay " Politics and the English Language . " To refer to " consciousness " in this manner -- indeed , to refer to this film as " based in science " in general ( which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave - states " democratic republics " and Hitler when he called his party a " socialist workers " movement.<br /><br />I do n't claim to really understand quantum physics . I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study . Ah , but we Americans do love " instant enlightenment , " and that 's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish . If it ASKED questions , that would be one thing , but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them , which no film could possibly do simply because we are far , far away from the answers ( if they indeed exist).<br /><br />By the way , ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several " expert commentators " with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ( and TM ) , not to mention J.Z. Knight , who often speaks in her " Ramtha " voice . ( I 'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year - old Atlantean superman 's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology . But then again , this film argues that the past , present and future are all one and the same , so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago , I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow . Only , then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers ? Oh , I forgot , I 'm the creator of " good " and " bad " advice , so it 's all my fault , not Ramtha's.)<br /><br />What a mess .
0 At first glance this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking . Of course , when something provokes thought , it can then be scrutinized . The reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions . The link that " What the Bleep ... " would have you see between science and spirituality is , in fact , not rooted in science at all . The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area , Washington D.C. in this case . In reality the HRA ( Homicides , Rapes , and Assaults ) crime rate was about 30 % higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992 . There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study . In fact , each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked.<br /><br />My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke . Either way , I suggest that you do not waste your time.<br /><br />If you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts , you might consider Mindwalk ( 1990 ) .
0 I will admit that I 'm only a college student at this present time , an English major at that . At the time I saw this film I was a high school student -- I want to say junior year but it may have been senior , hard to remember . My experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course , an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like . I 'm not a PhD by any means.<br /><br />That said ... <br /><br />This movie is simply terrible . It 's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is . My mother is such a person and ever since she 's seen this movie she 's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film . I attempted to point out the various flaws and problems I 'd seen with the films logic and science -- and they are numerous -- and she dismissed my claims because " oh , so a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs . " In this case , apparently so.<br /><br />Leaving behind the fact that earning a PhD does n't necessarily require that a person be correct or , in fact , intelligent . Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film . Leaving that behind , the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when , in fact , he completely opposed them.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.<br /><br />http://www.intuitor.com / moviephysics / bleep.html
0 I went into this film expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi . Boy , was I wrong . Yes , there is a poorly written , poorly acted plot in the movie ( with CG animated cells and peptides to boot ) . However , the real focus of the film are the " expert " talking heads spewing out new age feel - good hogwash in between plot segments.<br /><br />Sure , it stars off innocently enough . There is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning . It states , for example , that electrons exist as both particle and wave , and that an atom is mostly empty space . However , the movie takes a giant ( and unscientific ) leap , saying that sub - atomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well . The talking heads take it even further . According to them , the following are true:<br /><br />-When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean , the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different . -Meditation can reduce the murder rate . -With positive thought , you can walk on water . -Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water.<br /><br />And hey , that 's only in the first 40 minutes!<br /><br />Watching the movie was torture . This film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult . After doing my homework , I realized that it basically is just that.<br /><br />On the other hand , this could be seen as a campy comedy ( albeit one that 's not funny).<br /><br />Save your time and money : do n't see this movie .
0 I did n't know much about this movie before I watched it , but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics so I was interested . What I did n't know is that this is NOT ACTUALLY A STORY but a bunch of New - Age blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics . I say it belongs more in the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama.<br /><br />Marlee Matlin is in the movie , in order to give this New Age symposium * some * sort of a storyline . Her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speaker 's thoughts so we wo n't die of boredom . Matlin has a real job as a photographer , unlike the New Age hippie that crashes on her couch . We get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all " means " to them . The one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India ( I assume ) , but I think he showed up for the wrong film.<br /><br />It looks like Barbara Eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs . It looks like Quark from DS9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film . There is a lot of whizbang CGI we 're supposed to be impressed with ; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds , because the filmmakers have apparently seen Flubber one too many times.<br /><br />People in the movie say that the Arawak people on San Salvador thought Columbus 's ship the Pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before , as if people today had any way possible way of knowing . Of course they leave out all of that information and just say " Columbus 's ships were invisible to the Indians in America . " The film takes many such arrogant leaps . Thomas Young did a double - slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time , and a wave some of the time . Of course you 'd never * know * this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that " atoms can be particles and waves . " And that must mean that people can pass through walls , walk on water , and never grow old if they just wish upon a star ! ! Then I 'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just * believed * hard enough . I 'm being sarcastic , but this film is chock - full of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them do n't really hold.<br /><br />These are New Age kooks who have grabbed onto Quantum Theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation , zero point energy , crystal healing , etc . If these snake - oil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling , could n't they just * wish * their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film ? We get to listen to another nameless man , with no credentials that we know of , talk on his couch in front of a fireplace ( or TV screen ) about how he creates his own life . Every time he was on the screen I wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face . These people take themselves WAY too seriously . Some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever * really * touches anything because there 's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level . If only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach , screaming " I 'm not touching you ! I 'm not touching you ! " A moral relativist in the movie claims that there 's really " no such thing as good or bad . " So apparently it 's OK that Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death ? Another person says that there is " no such thing as love . " It 's just a chemical and that we really do n't love people , we 're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we 're around them . I suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years.<br /><br />We are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception , seeing everything like RoboCop . They evaluate if women are cows , dogs , or foxes , and a sexual position pops onto the scree . Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she 's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she 's a beautiful and unique snowflake.<br /><br />I liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre - conceived notions . Perhaps in this review I 'm only seeing what I want to see , but I TRULY wanted to see these people get pies to the face , and it never happened.<br /><br />If you 've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before , you may find them interesting , but there are better sources for all of the ideas here . If you want to watch a good movie that talks about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , go see The Man Who Was n't There . If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory , read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku . If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals , see Waking Life ( although it can feel boring , self - important , and pretentious at times ) . All in all , you should go and read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie.<br /><br />I normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 , but this one was a very easy for me : 1/10 Stars.<br /><br />The movie 's title is true . The people in this film do n't know # $ * ! Hands down , the worst movie I 've ever seen .
0 This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas , capped by such statements like " we all create our own reality".<br /><br />Sorry , folks , reality is what true for all of us , not just the credulous.<br /><br />The idea that " anything 's possible " does n't hold water on closer examination : if anything 's possible , contrary things are thus possible and so nothing 's possible . This leads to postmodernistic nonsense , which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas , well - founded and stupid , are equal.<br /><br />To quote sci - fi writer Philip K. Dick , who put it so well , " Reality is that which , when you stop believing in it , does n't go away . "
0 What The Bleep Do We Know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe . We are presented with a parade of apparent experts ( none of whom are named ) who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner . Their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini - plots.<br /><br />The film pilfers themes from science , philosophy , theology and politics , minces them together without any regard for accuracy , and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions . We are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence , and any other difficult to answer question the film - makers would like to point their finger at.<br /><br />It is riddled errors and logical non - sequiturs . How did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo - scientific spirituality and mysticism ? It 's like saying ' two plus two equals four , therefore I can move objects with my mind'.<br /><br />There is nothing original in this film , and almost nothing that is accurate . Any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy - handed editing , intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance . Educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on .
0 Ridiculous . This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment . If you are wondering who the * bleep * Ramtha is : " Ramtha is a 35,000 year - old spirit - warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight 's kitchen in Tacoma , Washington in 1977 . Knight claims that she is Ramtha 's channel . She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood 's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural , husky voice . She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ( $ 1,000 a crack ) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment , and from the sales of tapes , books , and accessories ( Clark and Gallo 1993 ) . She must have hypnotic powers . Searching for self - fulfillment , otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold , muddy , doorless maze . " John Wheeler , one of America 's finest theoretical physicists , would roll his eyes about this movie . He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory . This movie does the same thing as those fools.<br /><br />There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico . I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult 's coffers.<br /><br />http://skeptico.blogs.com / skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt . It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage - thinking of this movie .
0 I ca n't believe that the City of Muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there . This show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law - enforcement officers . I have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life . If they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie . I only saw it once and was appalled at what I saw . I wanted to see the little guy get into a foot - chase with a bad guy . What a joke that would have been . Nothing on the show was even close to the real world . The city of Muncie , the Police Chief , and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city . No wonder it did n't stay around on TV
0 Not an altogether bad start for the program -- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement . The worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but . Men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this . What is next , medical school in a minute ? Charo performing lipo ? Charles Grodin assisting on a hip replacement ? C'mon ... show a little respect . Even the citizens of Muncie are outing the program as staged . Police Academy = High School Gym ? Poor editing ( how many times can they use the car - to - car shot of the Taco Bell in the background ? ) , cheesy siren effects ( the same loop added ad nauseum to every ' call ' whether rolling code or not ) , and last , but not least -- more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at.<br /><br />If I want to see manufactured police work and wise - ass fake cops , I would watch RENO 911 .
0 What a poor image of Professional Police Officers is displayed on the Television in the watching of this alleged Reality show . One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a " stop " , then the " Pat Down " of the outside of one 's Garment , then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someone 's pocket and retrieved contraband , was cut out of the scenes , because if it was n't , the arrest in most places are going to be tossed , should they even get passed a supervisor . A report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand . If the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout , it is good enough for an arrest , but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect . Since I have n't seen a Dis - claimer from CBS ( I may have missed it ) , CBS could be in trouble .
0 SPOILER WARNING : There are some minor spoilers in this review . Do n't read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film.<br /><br />The Disney Channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel . Most of these are mediocre and drab , having a few good elements but still being a disappointment ( ` Phantom of the Megaplex , ' ` Stepsister From Planet Weird , ' ` Zenon : Girl of the 21st Century ' ) . Every once in a great while , they make something really , really great ( ` Genius , ' ` The Other Me ' ) . But once in a while The Disney Channel makes a huge mistake , and gives us a real stinker . This month ( December 2000 ) The Disney Channel featured ` The Ultimate Christmas Present , ' which I thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting . Apparently , ` The Brainiacs.com ' was rushed out a few days before Christmas to get a jump on the holiday , because the plot has to do with toys . They even paid for a feature in the TV Guide , so I thought it must be better than the norm . I was in for a complete shock . Only Disney 's ` Model Behaviour ' has been worse than this.<br /><br />The plot was more far - fetched than normal . I usually let that slide , but here it just goes too far . Matthew Tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work . His father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat . Time and time again , his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter . Matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home . He gets a hair - brained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing . That whole concept is full of fallacies . When kids send in millions of dollars , Matthew opens his own company 's bank account and buys up most of his dad 's business 's stock . He is the secret boss , but he does n't reveal this to his dad , but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer . That image itself is so complex ( and ridiculous ) that it is n't possible for someone to create it at home , much less someone who comes across as stupid as Matthew . To make a long plot short , Matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids , but a federal agent shows up inquiring about Matthew 's company , as it is fraudulent.<br /><br />There 's so much wrong here . As mentioned , the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses , which these kids are not . The website , the cartoon image , the computer chip , even the stuff they are being taught in school , are far too advanced for these kids . The acting by most of the cast , especially Kevin Kilner , is terrible . Some familiar faces are wasted . Dom DeLuise plays the evil bank owner , but his part is a throwaway . He has one good scene with Alexandra Paul ( who shows she has the ability to act ) in which he explains his motives , but nothing more . And Rich Little is wasted in a small role as a judge . There 's even some offensive and uncalled for anti - Russian jokes . But the greatest atrocities are the hard - hammered themes . These themes show up in many of The Disney Channel 's films , but never before have these ultra - conservative messages been pounded so strongly . The typical ` overworking parent ' idea is really pushed hard , and after delivering it inappropriately in ` The Ultimate Christmas Present , ' seeing it again sours my mood . Family relations are important , but Disney must stop this endless preaching , because working is important to maintaining a workable family , too . Except for cancelling activities thanks to work , the father did n't come across as that bad , but I found it offensive when the grandmother told him ` I do n't like what I see . ' Just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents MUST marry if they want to raise their kids right . Enter Alexandra Paul , whose character , while important to the plot , is there solely to be the love interest for the father . This offensiveness only proves that the Disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the Disney script barrel . Instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud , wait for the next Disney Channel movie . It has to be better than this . Zantara 's score : 1 out of 10 .
0 That 's right ! Under 9 on average , but maybe under 12s for some others ! I was 11 when I originally saw this on video and at such youth I was n't able to notice the shoddy cartoon - quality or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are Not the same or as good to see . Just about everything is so 2D here ! Belle is , I 'll agree , not even beautiful but just a plain - looking woman with tinted skin , she wears the same bright blue dress all the way through with not one glamorous dress on , Wardrobe is to say the Least , annoying - my ears may bleed if I had to listen to her everyday ! Lumiere , in both the original and the Christmas edition was suave and elegant , but here he is a womanizing , unfunny twit ! Cogsworth , despite being the no - nonsense housekeeper he is famous for , is a complete sh - t and the most insufferable character I 'd say ! He always seems to find shutting that unbearably grating pie - hole of his very difficult in this one and whose clock face should really have been used for turning back in time to the unforgettable two film in this series ! Poor , poor Mrs Potts was not brought to life by Angela Lansbury ( one of my favourite classic actresses ) but by Anne Rogers who captured none of Mrs Potts ' character , no offence to her ! Not if she did her best ! When the beast roars it sounds so horrifically fake with clearly no additional roars , snarls or growls by a microphone . I am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it would n't be as good but I 'm sure that more of a contribution would n't have hurt the Disney artists who , indeed , have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years . It 's alright , I guess , and I do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me . It 's quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies ! And to think that on my video of it the text on the back cover said " boasting brilliant animation " ! It 's a nice little flick but for one thing it 's also highly poor and , for another , those 3 words ought to have been saved for the next re - release of the original !
0 Disney has now made straight - to - video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features . Two of these were made for their 1991 classic , " Beauty and the Beast " . Well , these ones are n't really sequels , as they are both set in between the events of the first film . The first of these two straight - to - video films was " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " , which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor , but I think that can usually be expected with sequels . However , this second one , " Belle 's Magical World " , is definitely inferior.<br /><br />The film features three short stories , all of which take place while Belle is in the castle , and the place is under the spell of the enchantress . The first is " The Perfect Word " , where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast leads to trouble , and neither wants to be the first to apologize . The next story is " Fifi 's Folly " , where Fifi and Lumiere 's fifth anniversary is coming up , and Lumiere is unprepared , so Belle helps him . However , Fifi sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle , and thinks they 're actually in love . The film ends with " The Broken Wing " . In this story , Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing , but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the Beast finds out , as he hates birds ! < br /><br />The plot description I gave is for the original VHS version of Disney 's third " Beauty and the Beast " movie . Apparently , in the DVD version , there is another story added called " Mrs. Potts 's Party " , but I 've only seen the original version . However , since I highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest , I see no point in watching the special edition . Anyway , the first thing I will say about " Belle 's Magical World " is that the animation is very 2-dimensional compared to what we 're used to from Disney , which would obviously disappoint many people . I did n't like " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " that much , but you certainly ca n't say the same about its animation . I 'm sure the stories in " Belle 's Magical World " could entertain many kids ( mostly younger ones , I think ) , and each story has a moral , so they could also teach them some valuable lessons . However , for adults , the film really does n't have a lot . I personally did n't find any good humour in it , found that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast got tiring , and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way ( they 're not very well written ) . In " The Perfect Word " , the way Belle says to the Beast , " You 're acting rude ... and foolish ! " is a bit cheesy , and I think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories.<br /><br />By the time this straight - to - video movie first came out , I was around eleven or twelve years old . I do n't know what I would have thought of it at the time , as I had lost interest in Disney by then , and it would be years before I would gain any of that interest back . Even when this movie was first released , I think I was a bit past the age group it was aimed at . I never saw " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " until a couple months ago , but unlike that film , I never even heard of this one until recently , I think just after seeing the first sequel to Disney 's 1991 hit . Well , as much as I like the theatrical original , I would n't have been missing much if I never became aware of this film 's existence . For little kids , I 'm sure " Belle 's Magical World " can be highly entertaining , and probably somewhat educational with its morals , but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans .
0 This movie is possibly the cheapest , cheesiest , and poorest sequel ever made.<br /><br />Yet , it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by Disney , and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish.<br /><br />It 's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT * The first one 's all about Beast and Belle being petty over a pathetic argument . Then , three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle . Part way through this little episode , Belle has wall eyes , which made my siblings and I laugh so hard . Then , she and the Beast fight more over the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness . How old are they ? ? ? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness.<br /><br />Then , the next one 's all about Lumiere being the world 's biggest dope when it comes to romance . This coming from the man who could woo anything female . And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill Belle , and winds up getting off scotch - free by the end of it . What a message to send the kids!<br /><br />Then , the next one 's all about Mrs. Potts being angsty . And the next one after that 's all about Beast becoming overly possessive of a bird , to the point where he just seems downright silly.<br /><br />The animation 's so ugly , it kills . There are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see ... and the coloring is awful.<br /><br />Belle 's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong . Plus , she 's petty and very different from the usual Belle.<br /><br />And the side characters are annoying ... ( I mean , Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time . I know they did that in the movie , but it was overdone in this.)<br /><br />But the worst character is Mrs. Potts . She 's ruined in this . I ca n't even describe it . Just buy it and see for yourself.<br /><br />I give it a 1/10 for the sap , but I give it a 10/10 for comedy .
0 I did n't feel as if I 'd been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS , but BELLE 'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST . Like CHRISTMAS , BMW hates its audience , although not to such an extreme degree . It 's ugly , uncanonical , idiotic , and the writing is horrifically bad . None of the stories work . These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all , they're a bunch of pod people . I wanted to dissect it , but after a few minutes , I gave up , because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously . What we have here are three stories . " The Perfect Word " is an overbearing , ponderous study of forgiveness . " Fifi 's Folly " only works if you can accept that Babette 's name is actually Fifi and that she 's a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women . " Broken Wing " ( or " Broken Wind " as I like to call it ) is probably the most heinous of the bunch . Beast hates birds ? Since WHEN ? Do n't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated . BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic , a transcendent celebration of love , art , intelligence and the human soul .
0 The trailers get you to the movie , but the movie just was n't worth my 8.50 .. it has some good effects , but the storyline .. yech , i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors , they have both done some good films , but i wish they had n't added this one to their resume 's . To be honest , the book is better ..
0 Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me . While the actors did a pretty good job , especially Smith , there just is n't a cure for a poor script once in production . The movie really had a " sequel " kind of feel , playing off partial events of the first film . The story was , in a word ... bad , at best . It was n't thought out well , and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times.<br /><br />In the first flick , the MIB Organization had a kind of " elite " force feel . You had a few special agents , and it had a " clandestine " kind of feel to it . In the sequel , the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp vibe.<br /><br />The movie was n't terrible or anything .. it just lacked the " coolness " ( for lack of a better phrase ) of the first movie . A lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second , and did n't really add any originality to the MIB Universe.<br /><br />A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 films . Was it decent ? Yeah . Is it worthy of bearing it 's title ? Not really .
0 I 'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility . The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers ' Union ( and that 's saying something ! ) . Get out your binoculars if you want , but there 's nothing resembling a joke in sight . Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish . The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability I 'm amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction , past the auditions . All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained . And it 's obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤100 per episode . And just in case anyone thinks I 'm commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with English humour , I must add that I am indeed English .
0 Honestly , I was disappointed in " Expiration Date . " Super clever title and interesting premise , but I do n't think it delivered . What was it about ? The main character 's desire to reconnect with his Native roots ? Or , more likely , it was his need to overcome his fear of death . But , he was n't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear -- it seems as if his life was going fine , but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying . I did n't buy it . Meanwhile , the supporting characters in the film did n't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story . They were all just doing their thing , running parallel to the main character . Also , what was treated as a " curse " looked more like a coincidence . Who cursed the family ? Why ? When ? Finally , why did n't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday ? Those are my criticisms , but I did love the shots of Seattle , cinematography was beautiful , acting was good in the times it was n't outstanding .
0 OK , it 's very rare that I complain something I got for FREE . So I guess this movie pushed me over that limit . I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and walked away very very disappointed . One audience member 's question to the director about using the Native American references just as " bookends " instead of being weaved into the movie better , basically says everything that this movie FAILED on . < br /><br />NATIVE American REFERENCES--- The Native American references felt really out of place and contrived . It 's obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before . They should have stuck to the old adage of " write about something you know " . IF they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice . < br /><br />Clichés and ON THE NOSE--- I agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie . So I held it to higher expectations . " Little Miss Sunshine " was an indie and saw it before it became so popular . Before it even came out to wide release I was already raving how it 's going to be a hit . UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about " Expiration Date " . " Sunshine " took us to cliché incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a " cliche " . This movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the start . The psycho mom 's antics , the Hendrix couple , etc . < br /><br />I hate to say it , but the best and WORST movie I 've seen this year were both indies . " Little Miss Sunshine " being the best and this movie being the worst . I wish I could say otherwise . < br /><br />But I do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery .
0 I do n't know what that other guy was thinking . The fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible . You can be as big a believer as you want ... the majority of this film is mindless drivel . I feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it . And that alone was no small feat . Not only is the acting terrible , but the plot is never even close to developed . There are countless holes in the story , to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore . I 've never read the book , so I ca n't critique on that , but this is the first review that I 've written here and it 's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life . I ca n't remember the last time I could n't even finish watching a movie . This one really takes the cake .
0 This film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers . The main point of the book , the insights , are hardly even touched upon , leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives.<br /><br />The character development is not good at all . No background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them , and so the action sequences fall flat.<br /><br />The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly , and with no real explanation , not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for.<br /><br />This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen . It is horrible and a waste of time . If you have not read the book , skip the movie and read it . If you have read the book , skip the movie and reread it.<br /><br />It is almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book , that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is . It is a shame too , because it could have been good had they capitalized on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors.<br /><br />Please do n't waste your time , READ THE BOOK ! ! !
0 Bingo is the game , bullshit is the name . Rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown - up hodgepodge of half - baked conspiracy theories , puritan prudery , and new - age gibberish . The bulk of the story is set at Viciente , a Cristian resort in the Peruvian jungle . Think Tolkien 's Rivendell meets Star Trek 's Planet Baku , inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not - so - mysterious , but surprisingly narrow - minded cult of love and peace . Thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design ( the rainbow - colored visualization of the mysterious all - healing " energy " is particularly hideous ) , " The Celestine Prophecies " looks and feels like a discarded 1980s " Twilight Zone " episode . Factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound . I ca n't believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be a part of this . Maybe it was made without his consent , Bowfinger style . May the Lord have mercy on the director , the screenwriter , the author of the novel , and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book .
0 I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie . Be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book . Many of the book 's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie . It is a " B " movie at best . Many events , characters , how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur . The flow of events that in the book are very smooth , are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child . The character development is very poor . Personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book . The direction is similar to a " B " horror flick . I understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book , but they screen play base missed many points . The casting was very good .
0 The film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book , which as far as I can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction . In reality , there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed I 'm sure he 'd have to admit he 's never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient Aramaic found in Peru . These " valuable " texts written as usual by anonymous , were destroyed by the evil " truth haters " in the church and in the local government . That 's rather strange , as all kinds of New Age crap comes out each year --- hundreds of books , dozens of movies -- and the Roman Catholic church does n't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as I do , a total crock of doody . I 'm no fan of the church , mind you , but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real.<br /><br />It 's a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by " evil " men or in Joseph Smith 's case , got taken back to Heaven once translated . Therefore , the actual texts can not be found in any museums like the Smithsonian , nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like Coptic or Aramaic . It 's a scam . In one sense , I admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it , but I could n't do it myself , as I 've no desire to mislead the public with more New Agey hokum.<br /><br />Occasionally , a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years . The Gospel of Judas , a Gnostic text , was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text , deemed authentic by experts . The Gospel of Judas was referenced as heretical around 300 C.E .. No church documents from that time mention any Celestine Prophecies as authentic , heretical or anything else.<br /><br />We are evolving towards something -- that much is true --- but the optimism in the Celestine Prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies , and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies , like a castle built on sand will collapse . The harsh , ugly , overpopulated , cruel world of Blade Runner is more likely what it 'll be like over the Horizon , than some Utopian Hippie Commune where all is love and peace ! I tell people the truth and they hate me , but tell them what they want to hear , even if pure piffle , and one can make millions . The Celestine Prophecy is what the world wants to hear . Too bad it is a castle built on sand . Do n't get me wrong . I wish to God , the Celestine Vision was reality , only it 's not . No ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the Insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution . These New Agey ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until Darwininan Evolution became well - known . That means the ideas in the Celestine Prophecies can not be older than the 1800s C.E , and do not go back to the early B.C.E period or near the time of Jesus of Nazareth . This type of claim by New Agers is not at all unusual . Wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft -- the " old religion " goes back to the stone age , when in reality no Book of Shadows has ever been known to exist prior to Gerald Gardner who lived in the 1900s and was the buddy of Aleister Crowley.<br /><br />New Age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings , when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by Gurus today . Why do they do what they do , perpetrate such fraud ? Simple : there are millions of dollars to be made , and the modern Guru acquires power over his or her followers . They compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things . Each New Age group bitter opposes the others . It 's a struggle for your minds and your wallets.<br /><br />But learn one thing from me , that is actually similar to one of the insights , learn to follow your own instincts and look for guidance from within . That I can agree with wholeheartedly .
0 I must admit I do not hold much of New Age mumbo jumbo . When people " exchange energy " I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem . When energy " is enforced " I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without Nobel prizes . When people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station.<br /><br />But then again , this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining . If this were the case with " The Celestine Prophecy " I would n't burn this movie down , but unfortunately it is n't . Every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location . This results in many " Ah - s " and " Oh - s " , like I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand.<br /><br />The direction is uninspired as well . You might expect something more from the guy who did " What dreams may come " , but hey , I supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver : " It 's your money , buddy .. " The only one who seems to be having fun is all - time bad guy Jürgen Prochnow . Not only does he have a job , he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring New Age chatter.<br /><br />This movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up . At one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurts.<br /><br />If you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids , take my advise : choose the latter .
0 My dear Lord , what a movie ! Let 's talk about the " special effects " first . Do n't get me wrong here , I am not one of those effect fanatics but I was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past , mainly the 60 's . So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it . But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60's ... <br /><br />What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message . Acting is secondary , effects are secondary , I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies . However , in a movies like this bad acting , incredibility , etc . add up to make a bad movie even worse - that 's what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy.<br /><br />My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so.<br /><br />There could be one single reason to watch this one though . If you really love cheesy movies it 'll be the right one for you . If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars.<br /><br />By the way , three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there , like " Critical Mass " ( look up the comments on that one - hilarious ) . The Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree .
0 Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best - selling philosophical novel " The Celestine Prophecy " , which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru . Home video quality actors present so - called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum , while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy - handed direction of Armand Mastroianni . Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABC 's " Lost " or Dan Brown 's " The Da Vinci Code " , the filmmakers are hardly up to the task . This film reeks of ill - conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda , and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point .
0 Boring . Minimal plot . No character development . I went into this movie with high expectations from the book . It COULD have been an awesome movie . It COULD have probably become a cult classic . Nope , it was a giant let - down . It was poorly cast and had horrible special effects . It was difficult to determine who were the bad guys : the rebels or the military or the church or all of them ? I am still left puzzled by certain mini - plots from the movie . I am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so - called " prophecy " , which is never really FULLY explained . I felt like I was watching a corny episode of a mini - series on the sci - fi channel . It seemed very much like a made - for - TV movie . Do n't go see this movie . It is a waste of time AND money .
0 The movie was TERRIBLE ! ! ! Easily the worst movie I have seen in the past few years . One of those movies I will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of . Thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question " What is the worst movie you have seen ? " Answer : Celestine Prophecy . Trust me ... I read the book , enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie , but then , they treated the audience like we are r*tarded . There is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence . It is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and ca n't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow . They did n't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died . It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie . The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book . The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart . DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE . Trust me .
0 I have just seen this movie and have not read the book . The good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject , evolution , sincronicity and your part in the world.<br /><br />However , the movie 's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters . It is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version . The events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable . A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence , and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose . < br /><br />Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to . Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves ( in Little Buddha ) ? Well , this is nothing like that.<br /><br />Most scenes are poorly executed . There are a lot of scenes that really do n't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.<br /><br />The better actors in this movie , namely Hector Elizondo , Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow can not save it . The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie , and because they were paid more , but this does not work . Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.<br /><br />Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy ( as always ) , but the script does not help him at all . The scene where he first tries to convince John ( Matthew Settle ) to join him is just bad script . The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed . The flashbacks throughout the movie can not even be commented.<br /><br />Overall this movie is a big waist of time , read the book ! I have not read it , but it is probably a billion times better than this , it has to be.<br /><br />It is so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb .
0 This delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad film - making may not " open " you up , to borrow one of the film 's favorite verbs , but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching . Based on the best - selling book by James Redfield , first ( self ) published in 1993 , this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher ( Matthew Settle ) who , on traveling to deepest , darkest , phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal . Namely what he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated , perhaps because they 're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir . Although there 's a lot of talk about " energy , " that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann , Annabeth Gish , Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow , all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon . For those who care , the plot involves the military , terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church ; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield , Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script . In short , easily the worst film seen in 40 + years of viewing movies .
0 This movie is just not worth your time . Its reliance upon New - Age mysticism serves as its only semi - interesting distraction . The plot is one that has been re - cycled countless times.<br /><br />I was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when I noted that some have tried to prop - up the reputation of this drivel . Their motivation & objectivity is dubious , since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults , but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness.<br /><br />So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians , or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies / television that support their views ? In spite of the poor qualities of production , or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis ? I hope not.<br /><br />I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie , in spite of the truth .
0 I read the book and the book was fascinating.<br /><br />This movie , it 's direction , the screenplay , and the acting were totally insufferable . I cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel , a novel that has all the action , simplicity , and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story.<br /><br />I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities . Would not ever recommend this film to anyone I know . < br /><br />Simply , one of he worst adaptations I have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth.<br /><br />The cinematography was indeed the only highlight . But , how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as Peru . < br /><br />To prospective viewers , do not waste your time or energy on this flop .
0 I went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of " spiritual " New Age types , who , quite unlike me , very much enjoyed this movie --- although according to those that also knew the book ( apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense ) , the movie is not quite as good . So , if you tend to think of yourself as " spiritual " , believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like " aura " and " astral body " , and do n't mind the frequent use of the term " energy " outside of the context of physics or technology , you might actually like the movie , and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on.<br /><br />However , if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe , if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane New Age nonsense and plots based thereon , if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality , and perhaps even expect reasonable non - wooden dialog an acting , then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie : Stay . Away.<br /><br />Don't even think about it . Tonight , this movie displaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I ever personally saw in a movie theater ( I do not count movies I went to see with the expectation of them being bad , such as Plan 9 etc . ) . At the same time , it raised the grand total of movies I almost walked out on to two ( D&D being the other one ) . I do not walk out on movies , not even on this one , but I should 've when I first saw the visual depiction of an aura , because the New Age BS keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.<br /><br />The plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies , in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution . Or something like that . They actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution , which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe . The movie is shock full with whoppers like that . Occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as " another dimension " , or perhaps " another plane " , only to become invisible to those around them who have n't yet reached enlightenment . Goodness.<br /><br />At the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the " insights " making up the prophecy , painfully slow , presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better , more enlightened individuals.<br /><br />Good things about the movie ? Some very pretty nature shots , and some decent supporting performances by Elizondo and de Almeida.<br /><br />I honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable . It really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind , and unless that 's your thing , you better do something else with your time and money .
0 If you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one Latin country with any other Latin country , " The Celestine Prophecy " is a good example : 1 . Perú , not even in its most violent times , has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film . This showed a country like El Salvador when Civil War . Since I 'm a Peruvian who lives in Lima ( the capital of Perú ) , it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here , there and everywhere . 2 . If you have a car in Perú , and you want ( or need ) to be a taxi driver , just post a sticker with the word " Taxi " on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in Peruvian streets ( there are taxi companies , but their rates are quite expensive ) . No need of yellow or a black / white squared band on the doors of your car . Well , taxis in this film have that band , somethin that you will never see in Perú . 3 . Peruvian people are not Caribbean styled clothing . For example , when a taxi driver comes out , he was wearing a " Guayabera " ( Cuban shirt ) , a white hat , and 40 's mustaches , like Clark Gable . Not one Peruvian man looks like that , please ! Perú is not the Caribbeans ! 4 . A scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt , like the typical folklore dresses in Latin America . Take a walk anywhere in Perú , and you 'll never find a woman wearing like that , unless you are watching a typical dance . 5 . Cast could 've been better : I can not deny Héctor Elizondo is a great actor , but he 's not a Latin actor ( his father was Basque and his mother from Puerto Rico , but he was born in New York ) and his Spanish is not fluent . It 's notorious Spanish is not his first language . There are dozens of very good Latin actors who could 've performed as Cardinal Sebastián . Petrus Antonius ( General Rodríguez ) was also a bad choice for a " Latin Police officer " . It was so funny seeing Elizondo and Petronius in General Rodríguez 's office . They looked like two English or American students in a Spanish class , making their best effort in order to pronounce Spanish . Unsuccessfully , of course . Castulo Guerra was better in his Spanish . A " Peruvian " officer , who announced Cardinal Sebastián , spoke a quite funny Spanish too . There are very good Peruvian actors , like Augusto Alvarez - Calderón and Christian Meier ( just to mention two out of many Peruvian actors ) , who could 've performed with excellence . 6 . I admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or , even , countries . But , please , when creating a name , be careful when using a foreign language : The town portrayed in this movie should 've been called " Vicente " and not " Viciente " . Vicente is a male name , and Viciente has never been used . 7 . I disagree one user , who says that this movie was filmed on locations in Perú . Not one location is Peruvian , although the production has used in excess posters showing " Inca Kola " , the Peruvian soda . As not few American films , this one must have used any Latin country . After all , for American producers or directors , a Latin place is identical to any other Latin place . 8 . In the first scenes , when John ( Matthew Settle ) flies to Perú , he 's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in Perú : Jorge Chávez Airport ( in Lima , the capital ) . Actually , believe me , it must be any airport in the world , but Peruvian airport . And , of course , in Peruvian airports there are no military or police guards . 9 . When this John takes a room in a Peruvian hotel , this one has a fan and , obviously has no air conditioner . Please , this does n't happen in no hotel in Perú(and other Latin countries ) , unless you get a 1 star hotel ! 10 . The rebels who fight against the government are ... ¡ Colombians ! Their accent was , with no doubt , from Colombia . For casting them , the producers should 've hired Peruvian actors . In few words , it would 've been cheaper filming in Perú.<br /><br />I could go on with more examples out of this film , that led me to give it a " 1 " ( awful ) vote , but I fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning . But dear producers : It 's not a tragedy : There are many worse movies with not few mistakes . Just let 's remember " Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal skull " and indescribable Disney 's " The Emperor 's new groove " . The list of bad films could be endless ...
0 At first , three words : READ THE BOOK ! Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters . I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film . It was ludicrous , with half a heart and the story bad explained . The novel - in the first place ! - was n't meant to focus on an adventure ! That 's only the surroundings . In the film , the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat ! Additional , the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious ! They screwed it up ! ... I 'll never watch it again !
0 I have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time . The movie was boring , long long and awful plot . The special effects sucks like hell - It 's like watching a movie back in 1999 . It 's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time . Matthew Settle 's performance was quite bad . I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt . Speirs , he was n't THAT bad . In fact not bad at all . But in this film , his acting was n't convincing enough , it was quite bad and there was n't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either . Plus , his eyes seems empty like he 's not feeling it . It surprised me , really , because he was good in Band of Brothers.<br /><br />Anyway , do n't even bother to watch this movie . It 's a big big BIG waste of time . Even if you had to kill an hour or two , get something else to do besides watching this movie . Trust me , you 'll regret it !
0 I actually went to see this film in a theater , but what a complete waste of time and money ! Bad acting , I 'm sorry to say , did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay.<br /><br />Some friends told me to go and see this film , since James Redfield , the author of the book , was very heavily involved in the screenplay . They had really enjoyed the book , so the movie just had to be perfect . Well maybe I had my hopes up a bit too high , but I absolutely hated this movie ! It was predictable , too sweetish to a point that I actually left I had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel ! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade .
0 I actually did n't enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I saw it at a camp , and we did n't rave about it , we laughed at it . Sure , some parts are touching , but the acting is terrible , the effects are terrible , and the whole overall movie idea is terrible ( now , I know it was based on a book which I have n't read , but I hope that the book was better than this , because frankly , I thought that this movie was very bad and boring ) . Like I said , I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp , and we were excited to be there , plus I got a caffeinated drink , but nonetheless , I struggled to stay awake . The only thing that kept me up ( other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up ) was the gunshots , that were quite pointless as well . I just really did n't like it .
0 This movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic Hinduism and New Age Occultism dressed up with Western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons . Basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation . ( Some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600 's ) obviously reincarnated . God is an impersonal force . Animal life and plant life are all the same . ( This is Pantheism ) . Redfield has tried to mix Eastern Mysticism with Western Christianty . His attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality . As the ad in the old Berkeley Barb used to say for $ 10.00 will show you how to start your own religion . As one famous prophet has said , " Use the Force Luke " .
0 slow , incomprehensible , boring . Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book . This is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book . The best part of the movie was the scenery , excellent . The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances . The editing is abrupt and patchy . However , despite this , the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script . It was startling that although set in Peru there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering about the set - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century . If you have any sense of history , try to avoid this movie .
0 The book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life . But saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement . The acting , directing , cinematography , and storyline were all horrible . I would never recommend this movie to anyone . I 've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie ! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly , but they have left out too many key components of the book . The movie tried , but failed , to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy . While putting myself in the position who had not read the book , I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S. I am thoroughly disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie turned out .
0 I agree with the majority of the comments I have seen written . I grew up watching Seseme Street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born . I was born in 1964 , so I was 5-yrs - old when Seseme Street was introduced to television . The show taught me my numbers ( The Count ) , spelling ( the Muppet ) , and about life . I liked all the old characters ( Big Bird , Oscar , Grover , and Cookie Monster ) and do n't quite understand why they had to change . I understand that everything has to change in some way , but to make Cookie Monster into a " veggie monster " to promote healthy eating . The show has introduced new characters and monsters since it 's inception , why not make a separate " veggie monster " that talks / discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with Cookie Monster . But , back to my point . I grew up watching the very beginning of Seseme Street , my now 20 yr - old daughter grew up watching SS with me along side her , and we discussed Mr. Hooper dying , although he had died prior to her being born , as well as other topics on the show . I saw the episode as a older child , and still remember how well they portrayed the event , much like real life . And I 'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families . You saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events . The show has talked about traditional families , adoptive families and combined families . It 's one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios . I now have a 5 yr - old daughter who really does n't watch SS . I 've tried to watch the show a couple of times , but , it really is not what it used to be . The Elmo 1/2 hr with Mr. Noodle is absolutely ridiculous . Like many people have said , it does n't teach anything . It 's geared for the less than 18 month old ( maybe ) , and is n't even funny . I always prided myself on watching SS as a child , teen , and adult with my own child . Now on my second go - round , I really have a hard time watching SS . The topics that were discussed : death , marriage , non - traditional families , new to neighborhoods , moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2 - 99 year old to understand and relate to . Now , there are NO concepts taught , minimal counting , only the occasional mention of the alphabet . It is NOT the same SS , from an original watcher of the show . PLEASE if any producers from the show read these comments , return the show to its foundation . New concepts have never been a problem with SS , they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show .
0 My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVD 's for our daughter and I have to say , I do n't let her watch the new episodes on TV , because I find ALL of the characters annoying . Baby Bear AND Telly ? OMgosh , How ANNOYING and useless blabber can someone think of for their ' skits ' ? Elmo ? Give it a rest not every kid likes him , once again , annoying and does n't teach my child ANYTHING . Mr. Noodle ? what a reject . I think the one time I turned the ' new ' show on for her , she and I were left dumber than before . The show has Definitely taken a wrong turn . I remember the Yip Yips , Kermit 's Breaking News , 1 - 2 2 Little Dolls , Mumford the Magician , Bert and Ernie , Grover the Waiter , all the GREAT EDUCATIONAL skits of OLD SCHOOL S.S. Sesame Street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since Jim Henson 's passing in 1990 . The show no longer has the educational , funny and interactive skits it used to . I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non - educational blabber . Way to go S.S. producers / writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non - creative , non - exercised kids in front of so they 'll get out of their hair . Per Producers / Writers : I suggest you whip out the old muppets and start taping similar content to that of the first Sesame Street 's . Lord knows I sure do n't want my child talking like Baby Bear or Elmo .

0 SPLIT SECOND might have been a good movie . A story about a " road rage " homicide , has a very young Clive Owen giving a pretty good performance ; BUT ... but .... <br /><br />Unfortunately , the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camera - work and truly awful editing . The camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt ( I suppose ) to reflect Owen 's stress from business , family , and traffic . What this actually does is to give the viewer a headache.<br /><br />Since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie , but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography , one ought not waste time on this travesty .
0 I wo n't describe the story , as that has been done elsewhere . We are great Clive Owen fans , and when our Netflix recommended the movie , we were intrigued . < br /><br />No wonder we had never heard of this " movie " , because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992 . Hence , the poor production values , grainy image , jerky camera work and poor sound.<br /><br />But , you do n't really mind the mechanics , because the story itself will put you to sleep . It 's an interesting human story , but not at all compelling , and there is hardly any ending . You do n't really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie . Save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile .
0 This Worldwide was the cheap man 's version of what the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized " Big 3 " Stations during the Saturday Morning / Afternoon Wrestling Craze . When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett 's failed version of NWA he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and proceeded to drop all NWA references all together . NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were relabeled with the WCW logo and moved off the road to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando , Florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for WCW 's Nitro , Thunder , and Saturday Night . Worldwide was officially the last WCW program under Turner to air the weekend of the WCW buyout from Vince McMahon and WWF . Today the entire NWA World Wide / WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library in general lay in the vaults of WWE Headquarters in Stamford , Connecticut .
0 This film has nothing whatever to do with the Sphinx , and the title is just a come - on . The story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the Valley of the Kings , of King Seti I , second pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty , New Kingdom period . It is not a bad yarn , and a great deal of the film is shot on location . Even the scenes in the Winter Palace Hotel lobby in Luxor were really shot there , and not in a studio . The second unit stuff is endless , and they must have been let loose on Egypt for weeks . Frank Langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated Egyptian . He should take it up as a sideline . The film is essentially ruined by one of the world 's most irritating actresses , Lesley Anne Down , who plays the lead . She spends the whole film wondering how she looks , are her blue eyes refracting light at the correct angle , do all the fellas lust after her , etc . Having started life as a model at the age of ten , what hope could there be for her ? She epitomises everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dim - witted inanity . And to think that this film was directed by Franklin Shaffner , who won an Oscar for ' Patton ' ! He allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film , hysterical one moment , flirting the next , in a kind of hurricane of idiocy as she reels from one man to another , either screaming or making bedroom eyes , it matters not . She is supposed to be a young Egyptologist . But she has never been to Egypt before ! She takes a taxi to Giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids , gushes in ecstasy : ' But they 're so BIG ! ! ! ! ' Barf ! OK , so that was the script , but she takes to the banality too readily , giving the impression that it is her natural element , which I do n't doubt for a minute . Elements of the story are sound . There is , indeed , a serious problem about a black market in antiquities there . True ! Well done ! The novel by Robin Cook , which I have not seen , may be OK for all I know . It was fun to see the name of Cyril Swern as sound recordist on the film , as I knew him pretty well long ago . Stanley Kubrick 's step - daughter Katharina is described as ' draughtswoman ' . I wonder what that means ? Maybe she did some set work . Anyway , the antiquities in the film are pretty good , actually . And we get to see lots of the Cairo Museum and numerous scenic locations . They actually go inside King Tutankhamun 's Tomb ! I do n't imagine that would be allowed today for a movie . A lot of inappropriate scenes take place in mosques . That would not go down well today , but in 1981 such things were not on the agenda . The music for the film is absolutely appalling , worse than Lesley Anne Down in fact ! But there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic , one being the cacophony of traffic noise of Cairo , which is accurately rendered in the background , and would make anyone who knows Cairo chuckle nervously . Also , the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time , another touch of authenticity . Why did n't they get this right ? It could have been good .
0 Rather foolish attempt at a Hitchcock - type mystery - thriller , improbably exchanging espionage for archaeology and based on the Robin Cook novel ; incidentally , I ’ve recently acquired another adaptation of his work – COMA ( 1978 ) – in honor of the late Richard Widmark . For the record , director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL ( 1978 ) – a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and , unfortunately , SPHINX was a false step from which his so - far impressive career would not recover.<br /><br />Despite its scope and reasonably decent cast , however , this one proved a critical and commercial flop – mainly because the narrative just is n’t very thrilling : in fact , it ’s quite dreary ( feeble attempts at horror – the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment , rotting corpses galore , and even an attack by a flurry of bats – notwithstanding ) . Lesley Anne - Down is the lovely leading lady , stumbling upon a lost treasure – it ’s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners , who have appropriated much of the country ’s heritage ( under the pretext of culture ) for far too long . Sir John Gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts Down on the way of the loot , and pays for this ‘ act of treason’ with his life.<br /><br />Typically , it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be – so that apparent allies ( such as Maurice Ronet ) are eventually exposed as villains , while an ambiguous figure ( Frank Langella , whom I saw at London in early 2007 in a West End performance of “ Frost / Nixon ” , which has now been turned into a film ) goes from Down ’s antagonist to her lover and back again , as he determines to keep the wealth belonging to Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure .
0 Some nice scenery , but the story itself -- in which a self - proclaimed Egyptologist ( Lesley - Anne Down ) visits Egypt and , in the course of doing Egyptologist things in the most un - Egyptologistic of ways ( e.g. , flash photography in the tombs , the handling of old parchment , etc . ) , uncovers a black market turf war and somehow ( in the span of two days , no less ! ) becomes that war 's jumpsuit - wearing epicenter -- is more puzzling than any riddle the Sphinx ever posed . Down is simply awful as the visiting British scholar ( that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers , certainly ; but that she 's annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely ) , and the rest of the cast , including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella , seem as downright confused by the proceedings as I was . In short , not what you 'd expect from Schaffner ( Planet of the Apes , Patton ) and co.<br /><br />Worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which Down rails against all male scholars , blaming them for her failure as an academic , while bathed under the softest light Hollywood could muster . To top it off , she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find . Wow , talk about your performative irony!<br /><br />*Note to would - be Egyptologists : take a year or two of Arabic in grad school . It 'll really help out in the long run ...
0 The Robin Cook novel " Coma " had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 . A couple of years later it was the turn of another Robin Cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment , but in the case of " Sphinx " virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong . This is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances , stupid dialogue , unconvincing characters and leaden pacing . The only reason it escapes a 1-out - of-10 rating is that the Egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself . Hard to believe Franklin J. Schaffner ( of " Patton " and " Planet Of The Apes " ) is the director behind this debacle.<br /><br />Pretty Egyptologist Erica Baron ( Lesley Anne - Down ) is on a working vacation in Cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer Abdu - Hamdi ( John Gielgud ) . Hamdi befriends Erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge . Consequently , he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of Pharoah Seti I that he is keeping secretly in his shop . The very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in Erica , for it could provide vital clues in locating Seti I 's long - lost tomb , a prize as great as the discovery of Tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 . Before Hamdi can tell Erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop , with Erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end . Afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen , Erica attempts to track down the treasure . She finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties , none of whom are truly trustworthy . For one there is Yvon ( Maurice Ronet ) , seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives ? Then there is Akmed Khazzan ( Frank Langella ) , an Egyptian for whom Erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her.<br /><br />The biggest problems with " Sphinx " generally result from its total disregard for plausibility . Down could n't be less convincing as a female Egyptologist  one assumes she would be quite well - educated and resourceful , yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick . On those rare occasions that she actually is n't running from a potential villain , she does other brainless things such as taking Polaroid flash photos in a 4,000 year old tomb ! The plot twists are heavy - handed to say the least , mainly comprising of revelations and double - crosses that can be predicted well in advance . One ca n't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare , because the pacing is awfully sluggish . What little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium . A famous review of the movie declared : " Sphinx stinks ! " Never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words .
0 When this movie was released , it spawned one of the all - time great capsule movie reviews : Sphinx Stinks . It does , but in a mesmerizing sort of way . The casting is silly , starting at the top : Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians ? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that , at least not while this film was being made . But it 's rather amusing to see them try . The performances run the gamut from mummy - like ( sorry , the obvious observation ) to over - the - top , with very few stops in between . The Lesley - Anne Down character seems as though she could n't find Egypt on a map , much less expound upon its archaeological treasures . That 's due at least in part to some really bad writing , one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie . It 's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric , such as Egyptology , are ripe for silly , overwritten dialogue . It does n't disappoint , and the convergence proves a double - whammy . The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension : Can this get dumber and less believable ? The answer is , usually , YES . The location shots are beautiful , and the set design is generally very good , the only consistent reminders that this was n't some low - budget production . That and the fact that there are so many well - known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher . Cheap , no ; cheesy , yes .
0 The most misogynistic movie of all time ? Not to mention by ' 68 should n't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the " Indians " ? My favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them . Rape is fun ! Who knew ? Let 's see , then there 's the blatant rip - offs of " The Hustler " ( fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the Indians with the lead rebel dude ) , the horrific acting , the so - on - the - nose - they - might - as - well - have - just - told - you - what - to - think music cues , the lack of ANYONE WHO 'S ACTUALLY Indian in this movie . And who are we supposed to be rooting for ? I have to say it figures that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie . Even though his movies tend to champion strong women , I 've heard from at least one source that in real life he 's a misogynistic idiot . Why did I watch it , you ask ? Do n't ask .
0 The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made . This one delivers a lot of fighting , generous amounts of blood , bikers fighting Indians , and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time . The acting is beyond terrible . What ever happened to Robert Walker , Jr. ? At one point he was in some major studio productions , and then he just faded away . This movie really blows , but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time , it is a good one to watch . At the end of the movie , you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it !
0 Irwin Allen was great . All of his TV shows had a great pilot , or first episode . the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows . A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were rip offs of his older TV shows . One episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation . The show was high budget and too expensive to continue . Irwin lost his touch with TV shows after the 60s . The acting is strong with Martin Milner . Child stars got there starts with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt . one bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the " Master of Disaster "
0 Three Stooges - Have Rocket , Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature length film to star the Stooges and it is pretty bad . It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE ( from 1963 ) look like a masterpiece.<br /><br />The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place . They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus . They meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call " Uni " which they bring back to Earth with them . " Uni " speaks like an average , pleasant person - ' Oh , hello . How are you ? Lovely planet here . Hope you like it . ' Hilarious.<br /><br />Very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on.<br /><br />The Stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes , but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens . The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over.<br /><br />High point of the film - the end where the Stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey . The Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies . Brutal.<br /><br />Another writer mentioned the fine musical score . Huh ? The only music I even noticed were two classic tunes - I'LL TAKE ROMANCE and THERE GOES THAT SONG AGAIN , both of which are played at the party . And * that * really is the high point of the picture - music from old Columbia films.<br /><br />The tall sexy blonde was nice.<br /><br />Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only store .
0 Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has . The movie is pretentious garbage . It does not achieve anything at an artistic level . The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India . If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy , the ban would have been more justifiable.<br /><br />Now that I 've got my distress out of my system , I am more able to analyse the movie : < br /><br / > * From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English . The director , of course , did not make the movie for an Indian audience ; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it . Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true.<br /><br / > * Next we get regular glimpses into Radha 's dreams . These scenes are not very effective . They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie . I 'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story . I felt that the surrealism was lost.<br /><br / > * The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement . In any case , they do not achieve either of the two.<br /><br / > * The names chosen for the women , Radha and Sita , are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences . However , since the film was n't meant for Indian audiences in the first place , the shock - through - name - selection is not meant to achieve its goal , which is absurd.<br /><br / > * The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled . A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.<br /><br / > * The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role , the others were wasted . I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film . The male leads were outright rubbish.<br /><br />In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director , stay away from this one . Please .
0 There 's plenty to appreciate here : spectacular locations and flying sequences ; period costumes , props and sets ; and competent writing and acting . However , to enjoy a drama , we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire . In this bunch of catty snobs , we found only one character who is at all likable  a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim . From the reviews here , it is clear that we are completely out of step , but we did not find their malicious - schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining . Even the dog is detestable . We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes , so you should discount these observations accordingly , but what I could find written about this mini - series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption .
0 I bought this DVD set , sight unseen , and wish I had n't . The script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book . The lighting is horrid , very unpolished , but if it was just that I could overlook it . The script does n't focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who(especially in the planes -- no idea who dies when).<br /><br />I have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters ; if you do n't have that you do n't have anything . There was no focus on the characters at all -- you never got to know them -- who they were , what they liked .. what made them do the things that they do . The series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts ... I bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they did n't detail the characters --- they put a lot of filler in it .... I will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes LOL ( I mean do we really need to see that over and over again ? ? ? ) . I would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters .
0 " Piece is Cake " is defeatist , revisionist history of the worst kind , whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the ( admittedly fictional ) pilots it portrays . It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />In the March 1989 " Aeroplane Monthly " , Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini - series . A few of his comments are worth repeating:<br /><br />"There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that I saw in action , and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in ' Piece of Cake ' . It would not have been tolerated for a moment ... ... The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club , though with more discipline . Nor was there any sense of ' death or glory ' . RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country , and now we were required to do it - no more and no less.<br /><br />"There was no discussion of ' bravery ' or ' cowardice ' . People either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did . But we knew fear , recognised it in ourselves and in each other , did our damnedness to control it , and then got on with the job ... <br /><br />" ... I could feel no ' glory ' , but there was a sense of greatness , and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to ' Piece of Cake'." < br /><br />Beamont was , in his own words , " a fighter pilot who , unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series , was there at the time".<br /><br />Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB , before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the Typhoon and Tempest , and a post - war test pilot.<br /><br />"Piece of Cake " is an absolute , total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time . It is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace ...
0 The trouble with the book , " Memoirs of a Geisha " is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American man 's way of thinking . Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music , sets , and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.<br /><br />The movie is n't about Japan or real geisha . It is a story about a few American men 's mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions . So what is this movie if it is n't about Japan or geisha ? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said ? Yes , but then why make it into an American fantasy?<br /><br />There were so many missed opportunities . Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang - ups , no connotations of sin about sex . Sex is natural and normal . How is sex handled in this movie ? Right . Like it was dirty . The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch . < br /><br />Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie ? Nope . One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she does n't want to get caught doing something dirty . Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.<br /><br />Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off ? Nope . She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block . Of course she is n't supposed to enjoy it . And that is what I mean about this movie . Why could n't they have given her something to enjoy ? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?<br /><br />Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuri 's secret patron , and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity . He could have rigged the auction and won her himself . Nobu did n't even bid . So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and , reeking of old - man stink , get his fingers all over her naked body ? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?<br /><br />Let 's try to make sense of this . By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuri 's geisha training . In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab . Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuri 's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her . The Chairman was n't her patron . He was her pimp ! Some romantic love story.<br /><br />Yes , the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive , alluring transvestite whose voice , appearance and every touch are thrilling . But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret . Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart , soul , spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male . Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie , distortion , and terribly wrong.<br /><br />Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG:<br /><br />Japanese style  Refined , elegant simplicity . MOAG style  Peking Opera.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Hair swept up . MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.<br /><br />Japanese shaved ice - Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances . Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat . MOAG shaved ice - The Chairman buys Chiyo , the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo , this treat during cherry - blossom - viewing season . The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers . MOAG geisha - sluts.<br /><br />Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes , thanks to the breeze , Japanese people feel somehow cooler . MOAG wind chime - a door bell ! If a person stood in front of another 's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic , not gain entrance.<br /><br />Japan  Emphasis on human relationships , group oriented . MOAG  " I want a life that 's mine " American individualism.<br /><br />Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance . An almost geometrical and mechanical precision . MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a not - very - auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud . Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club ? Ha ha ha ! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?<br /><br />Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community . Fires can rip through those wooden villages , towns , and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people . MOAG house fire - Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out - of - control fire miraculously puts itself out . Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again . Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.<br /><br />Enough . The movie stinks .
0 Even though the book was n't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of Japan . I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it did n't feel Japanese in the slightest . Almost everything about it was terrible . I will admit the actors were generally quite good but could n't stand a chance of saving it . Before the film started I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the movie had opened in Japan . 30 minutes in I was amazed they stayed . I stayed so I would have the right to criticize it . The whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend . Everyone I saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces . < br /><br />To the makers of this movie , you owe me two hours .
0 Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about . Unfortunately , a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen , Samurai , the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from . Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings . The Geisha dances were not authentic . There was far too much use of Chinese music . A minor but essential detail : proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen . The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly , some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese persons .
0 Rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on - the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters.<br /><br />The marginalisation of Nubo , the minister , auntie , mother - and the dumbing down of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth . If you had n't read the book you would not really understand why Sayuri loved the Chairman and why Mameha became her mentor at all.<br /><br />Visually the film was stunning - and the actors all did the best with the C rate script they were given , but that was all that was good about this movie .
0 I love Memoirs of a Geisha so I read the book twice ; it is one of the best book I 've read last year . I was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie . I was n't expecting the movie to be that bad . Some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo ( Li Gong)been the worst . If I have n't read the book , this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable . The Plot Outline of the movie states " Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing ... " Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri ? Forget the movie and read the book .
0 " Memoirs of a Geisha " is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp , drag queen satire than anything to do with real people.<br /><br />The first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines , that they are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty . But other than one breathtaking dance , the rest of the movie degenerates into " Pretty Baby " in Storyville territory , or at least Vashti and Esther in the Purim story , as all the women 's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much , much older , drunken boorish men . Maybe it is Japanese culture that is being prostituted , and not just to the American louts after World War II.<br /><br />Perhaps it 's the strain of speaking in English , but Ziyi Zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in " House of Flying Daggers ( Shi mian mai fu ) " and " Hero ( Ying xiong ) . " Michelle Yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ( Wo hu cang long ) . " Only Li Gong shows any real life . Otherwise , I kept picturing Charles Ludlam in various roles , or even Cillian Murphy , as in kabuki theater , particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight.<br /><br />The supposed love story has zero chemistry , mostly due to the age differences , and I mostly felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped his Hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious " Chairman . " I remember more emotion in " Portrait of Jennie " as the young girl is anxious to grow up into Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton.<br /><br />We see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions , and as an ageless Ziyi Zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation . The finale has little sense of normality.<br /><br />The score includes many chopped up traditional melodies , with cello by Yo Yo Ma and violin by Yitzhack Pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation , that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography , as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting.<br /><br />As my mind wandered , I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story , which probably would have been more formal , but a lot more emotional .
0 Andrewjlau , I could not agree more . My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment , and I find this movie appalling . Quote from my Chinese girlfriend , laughing : " They are doing all this for a man ! ? " < br /><br />I find these women have no intensity , no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity , and that these men are hardly worth fighting for . During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over , the men look stupid more than admiring.<br /><br />Japanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people , and being geisha is Japanese culture . I am sure the Chinese had something similar , but the faces do not match the main.<br /><br />Anyway , the dialogue is so unmysterious , so American . Had a European done it with European orientals , they would have done a far better job.<br /><br />I have to add : it seems most of the people who liked the film are American . Sorry to say , but no wonder . All spelt out for you , not instinctive , not passionate . I think the Chinese actresses are lovely , but I could not say they were good actors in this film . Yes , the cinematography is great , but really , I can not see how it can be seen that these characters are complex , deep individuals.<br /><br />I'm going to Japan to see the real thing . I am sure that would be amazing to see .
0 Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes . Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants ? Not on the payroll apparently . < br /><br />A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes . In a later conversation she said , " Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates . Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O'Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950 's hairdo . Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was " missing the hoop " or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair , but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .... and be laughing in the aisles ... excellent story and photography be damned.<br /><br />So ... watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances , actual geisha or Japanese dress , and that was the topic of the movie ! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making . They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong . I thought " The Last Samurai " was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be . Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time .
0 American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese . The characters all badly represented , the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap , unreal and definitely does n't represent Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties . Who ever read the book understand that the script writers did n't add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script . Worse , they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs . Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon . Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture . Seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous . Quentine Tarantino 's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese made than that of this movie .
0 Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed movie , there is no doubt about that . And the acting is generally excellent , at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted.<br /><br />However , so many details small and large are just _ wrong _ that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully . A small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene ( no this does not spoil anything ) where Mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where Sayuri lives , on a snowy winter day . The bell she 's ringing is a fuurin , or wind chime - that is only left hanging outside of houses in Japan in the summer ! People in traditional Japanese homes did n't have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves . ( You may think this is such a trivial detail , but I would equate this to a movie made about America where a Christmas wreath is hanging on the door in July and no one thinks anything of it . ) And do n't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha , which is vaguely pan - Asian / Chinese / kung - fu - ish , and nothing like real thing . I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too . < br /><br />So , I suppose that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in Kyoto ( which is what " Miyako " is ) , then I suppose the more you will enjoy this . I honestly think this movie could have been so much better ... as it is , it 's just another Hollywood version of " exotic Japan " .
0 A slow , tedious , and one dimensional movie ! Good casting with clichéd dialogue , boring story line , and soulless direction from Mr Marshal ! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent , lacks heart , new insights , and depth . The lead character looks out of place due to her tiny phisique and phony looking contact lenses . The lexicon employed by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education . The story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little , boring , flat chested Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha , they actually say in the movie " She is destined to become a legend " i say hardy the case ! The movie is just plain boring , it is beautiful to look at , it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for cigarretes . Basically , if you do n't believe the messenger you wo nt believe the message , and this girl did n't fill the shoe ! Borin , boring , skip it !
0 I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago , but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and Asian arts . Overall , the scene is beautiful , but after restless emphasis on exoticism - oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them . The excessive cherry blossom was , frankly , overdone . It 's probably the cultural difference of perception here : the ultimate beauty is not the showy type , as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie . < br /><br />Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws . As a Taiwanese , I have no doubt the actress are great . An actor / actress can play any kind of role when he / she can look like it . Gong Li is great , but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style . All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN . Michlle Yeoh , one of my favourtie actress , did not even LOOK LIKE a Japanese . Some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate , feminine characteristics of Japanese women , with which I ca n't agree more . These are so delicate that I assume not even all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha , let alone the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture that much.<br /><br />Geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of American audiences . But it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the Oscar for best costume , best director or best picture .
0 Another double noir on one disc from Warner Home Video and by far the better of the two movies is RKO 's marvellous 1950 thriller " Where Danger Loves " . This is a memorable classic with a great cast in Robert Mitchum , Faith Domergue and Claude Rains . Crisply photographed in Black & White by Nicholas Musuraca it was tightly directed by John Farrow . " Where Danger Lives " is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was Hollywood 's past - ( See my full review).<br /><br />Unfortunately , none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc , the abysmal MGM 1949 stinker TENSION ! Poorly written ( Allen Rivkin ) and directed by John Berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations . The inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by Richard Baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife ( a risible Audrey Totter ) is totally implausible and unconvincing ( how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody 's guess ) . Then when she " unsurprisingly " ditches him for one of her playmates ( Lloyd Gough ) our timid pharmacist , instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune , plots revenge and attempts to kill Gough but at the last minute chickens out . The guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by Homicide detective Barry Sullivan ( another bland performance ) . So who did kill him ? Well , at this stage of the movie you really could n't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director Berry . Mr. Berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing . There is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off ! The only TENSION contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of Barry Sullivan as he gives the intro at the film 's opening . So much for that ! A most unfortunate effort ! C'est La Vie!<br /><br />Best things about this turkey is the smooth Monochrome Cinematography by the great Harry Stradling , an effective score by a young Andre Previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely Cyd Charisse before she found her dancing shoes . Hey ! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes ! HUH?<br /><br />In its favour however , are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers , commentaries and featurettes for both films . But the disc is worth it alone for the RKO Mitchum classic !
0 True , the setting in Paris is great . The actors are fine . The story is a twisted morality play . Is it supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough , it 's OK to hurt everyone else along the way ? In a real romance , you sort of want less cliché than the man who has become bored with his wife and is willing to dump his family , and the woman who is OK with encouraging him to do this . So what if they are decent looking and if Karen Allen shows off her body ? The characters are still self - absorbed and reprehensible . Maybe the moral of the story is " you get what you deserve " . I give it a 4 , only for the fast scan potential through the " male interest " bits .
0 This movie is n't terrible , really . Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans snicker at . But there are those , and not necessarily Anglo - Saxon yahoos , who do not care for Frenchmen ; and the Xavier character is n't going to sway them.<br /><br />Let 's consider his stereotypical Frenchman attributes:<br /><br />1 ) . Cynical - very cynical . Check.<br /><br />2 ) . Reedy , underfed appearance , check , despite:<br /><br />3 ) . A great appreciation of cuisine . Check.<br /><br />4 ) . Lukewarm work ethic . Check . ( Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker , from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks . ) < br /><br />5 ) . Beautiful wife , check . Despite that:<br /><br />6 ) . Loose interpretation of the marriage vows . Check.<br /><br />7 ) . Big sexual ego , which says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner . Check.<br /><br />Whether Mo is a hick or not , there 's no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than the script dictates so.<br /><br />On the other hand , as other male reviewers have , I did enjoy seeing Karen Allen 's cute , petite body . I 'll give the movie four stars ; two of them are for that .
0 Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I 'm still so bored I walk out , that is a stinker ! < br /><br />Karen gets stuck in Paris , and befriends a sissily - handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon . Of course he 's married , ( " But , cheri , why should that be a problem ? " ) What could be an interesting clash of cultures is ( believe it or not ) just dull . I walked out . < br /><br />Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left ; but it would have had to have gotten a LOT better to make up for a rotten beginning.<br /><br />My advice , if you find yourself in this , run , do not walk , for the exit . Save your time and your energy . Most assuredly save your money . It 's a shame the production company did n't save its money .
0 Watchable little semi - soaper , but hardly captivating . Still , two or three funny moments . What amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable McNicol is . She plays an invalid ( a leg problem ) , yet she not only is n't the " ugly duckling " whom men shun , but she is even a man - eater - and we are supposed to feel for her ! Oh , poor little McNicol , with her leg problem ... Poor little McNicol ? ? ! She is constantly getting passes from men , and even dumps them without so much as blinking ! At one occasion she even has a premeditated one - night affair with a blond stud , and then she tells her newly - found French girlfriend quite non - chalantly that it took him time to get an erection ! Makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg - conscious if every guy wants to hump her . Well , almost every guy ; the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone . But otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men ! No shyness , no lack of success with men , and she throws them away like toys ; the way she dumped Carradine was ridiculous . Poor little invalid girl ? ? I do n't think so . And yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem ; hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness . Nervousness ? ? The rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems , so this flute scene is absurd and does n't fit into the bigger picture . I was also surprised how quickly and eagerly McNicol makes friends with a French woman who is screwing a married guy . On the surface the movie would appear to be a " sentimental story of one crippled woman 's struggle for acceptance " ( or something like that ) but it 's nothing like that at all ; the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a " screw anything that moves - it 's the 80s " kind of movie - very confusing.<br /><br />As far as her leg : it 's not like she has a big , fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle . She " only " has a normal - looking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg , so I really do n't understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female Quasimodo or something , at the beginning of the film . It 's not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck ! Though McNicol is hardly a major catch . Kind of cutish but nothing special , quite average.<br /><br />But what the hell is Carradine doing playing some kind of a ( relatively ) smooth guy flirting with McNicol and her pal ? ! This guy was in " Revenge of the Nerds " ! But I guess it 's the same thing with the Carradines in the movies as it is with the Kennedys in politics : no matter how ugly , unable , or dumb , all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics , respectively.<br /><br />Down with nepotism.<br /><br />If you want to read bogus biographies about the Carradines , and other Hollywood nepotists and morons , contact me by e - mail .
0 - I had planned to write something explaining what I did n't like about this movie , but this is going to be more difficult than I thought . Honestly , I ca n't remember much about it . I watched it just three days ago and it 's made almost no impression on me . That 's usually the sign of a real stinker . About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it . The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look - a - like as the detective wore off real quick . It would be different if he could act , but he 's a one - note entertainer . The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them . If you ca n't spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see more Euro horror . The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer 's identity .
0 This movie is a cringe - fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot . But it is so much fun to watch . Everything about it is hilarious . The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co - worker who is intent on destroying them all . They catch up with him in the year 1146 . The ' futuristic ' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties - style room with a bunch of ' futuristic ' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed . The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb , which is n't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth - shakers like " I double - checked everything twice ! " He double checked everything twice ? He checked it four times ? Not only that , but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes , and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part . When Roger Corman ran out of money . And had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets . The medieval set is a comic mish - mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century . Any costume they could find , they used . I guess chain mail was n't on the budget , 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor . The fight scenes are laughable , with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast . It sounds truly awful , but I enjoy it every time I watch it . The lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous B - movie that , if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks , I would suggest you see . And once you have , read the review on Unknown Movies . I love hearing them point out all the funny , truly awful bits in the movie .
0 Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow.<br /><br />I liked the original Matrix a great deal . It was not a deep movie , despite Fishburne 's attempts to philosophize , but it was fairly well paced , fun , and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights.<br /><br />In the original , Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson . By day , corporate drone , and by night , brave hacker . Eventually , he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine , or does he go back to the safe , forgettable world he started in . Interestingly , he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions , life rather sucks . He has his girl by his side and his boon companions , but he eats processed swill , dresses in sweats , and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery . Still , the truth makes him free.<br /><br />At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the " what if it were me " questions raised in the viewer 's mind . What if _ I _ were capable of the impossible ? What if I were " The One " . It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of , with a cool title like that.<br /><br />Further , agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy , as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us . He was as unstoppable as a terminator , and as merciless.<br /><br />At the end of the Matrix , Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom.<br /><br />This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie , and it does so with such lack of gusto , such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I can not believe they had planned these changes . When the dialog is at a fifth grade level , with various long words dropped in randomly , I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying.<br /><br />My short list of characterization failures:<br /><br />The Oracle goes from mildly helpful , if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason.<br /><br />Major " personalities " of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster , for example , was a cute idea , but just not that interesting a character.<br /><br />Fishburne loses his " advisor " role , and gets nothing to replace it with.<br /><br />The people of Zion are not particularly likable , nor would you really _ want _ them running the world.<br /><br />Special effects problems:<br /><br />The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable . In The Matrix , you felt Neo could lose , and that he had to become something greater in order to survive . In The Matrix Reloaded , he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game.<br /><br />The fight on the freeway looked quite fake , and not that interesting.<br /><br />Pacing problems.<br /><br />As I mentioned above , the fight scenes were interminable.<br /><br />The rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch . Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies , but because we did not know about the people pictured , nor did we care.<br /><br />Whatever hack wrote the creator 's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business . It meandered , used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand , and was a waste of time and a pacing killer . The creator 's speech could have been done in a tenth the time , and with more peril as " Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix . There are now too many people who do not believe ; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it . Further , the earth can not support even the people in Zion , let alone these others . You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion , while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix." < br /><br />Instead , we got a long , drawn out bunch of twaddle . If someone argues that it is deep , ask for a transcript , and try breaking down the sentences . Each one is too long by several clauses , and uses words with clearer , shorter synonyms.<br /><br />So , in summary , not worth seeing.<br /><br />I have seen the third one , and despite what a number of reviewers have said , skip it . It does not save this turkey.<br /><br />The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were " deep " should go see some truly deep movies . Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate , and perhaps a bit of philosophy . This movie is just not hard to understand , but it is hard to stomach.<br /><br />Scott
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Continued ... <br /><br />From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself . First we meet a rogue program with the indication we 're gon na get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like . We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage , two ' ghosts ' that serve no real purpose and have no character what - so - ever and a bunch of henchmen . Someone 's told me they 're vampires ( straight out of Blade 2 ) , but they 're so undefined I did n't realise.<br /><br />The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle , only for far longer and far far worse . He has a simple point about cause and effect , makes it , then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid . His final line before walking off is comparable to Storm 's " do you know what happens to a toad ... " line in X - men in levels of utter bland baddness . The chocolate cake is such a lazy , pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her.<br /><br />And then we get another kung fu fight ! ! ! WHY ? Neo is , allegedly , The One . He can do anything . He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for . Kung bloody fu all the time . And while he can stop 1000 bullets , he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen ( vampires ? ) . I wanted to see mind blowing powers . I wanted to see him do the wildest , craziest most insane s * * * to people because he can do anything . I got the same as before without the ' wow'.<br /><br />The fabled car chase . That ca n't be bad . Well ... no , it 's not . It 's just not what we 've been tyold it was going to be . ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer . Every one . So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with , guess what , a kung fu fight ! ! ! OK , it 's not Neo , but you 'd have thought he 'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix . At least taught them something . It 's not hard.<br /><br />"Hey , Morpheus , do n't worry about what happens to you in the matrix . It 's not real . As long as you understand that nothing 's real then nothing can really harm you." < br /><br />There you go . Simple.<br /><br />OK , so the chase is not bad . It 's never boring and it does n't seem like 16 minutes . It 's just so underwhelming . And still , it gets worse.<br /><br />The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable . They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews . They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus 's over long , super preachy , monologue . To make it worse , they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is . You know basically , but you do n't know who 's doing what , when , so when one crew goes down you just do n't care and you do n't know how this is going to affect what goes on.<br /><br />I'll sum it up though , it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end . That 's the only reason it happens . Which raises the question , why did they need to send 6 people originally ? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself!<br /><br />Neo 's journey to the centre of the Matrix ( so to speak ) is handled equally lazily . Ooohhh ! ! ! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths ! ! ! Woooooo ! ! ! That must 've taken a lot of thought . Only now they 're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment . Man , what a grand finale!!!<br /><br />And then the Architect!!!<br /><br />Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy ? Add them together and double it , that 's how truly appalling the Architect is . The only reasonable potential of him is he 's about to set up the cliffhanging climax.<br /><br />And then he blows it!<br /><br />Let 's look at the options he gives Neo . Choose one door and all humanity dies ( except 27 ! ! ! ) . Choose the other and all humanity dies ! ! ! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it does n't really give it 's hero one . If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there 's the potnetial for inner torment and tension . Also , with Trinity being mid fall , the potential of a real cliffhanger that would 've made seeing the third more essential . But no . He has save no - one or save the missus.<br /><br />Now , the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end . The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they did n't notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking . " The Oracle told me I 'd fall in love with the One , and I love you " .... Come On ! ! ! ! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was?<br /><br />So , what do the Wachowski 's do in the sequel ? Well , they make the ending of the original look better . How ? Well , by doing almost exactly the same thing again ( only swapping characters ) only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse.<br /><br />And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger . It 's a reminder.<br /><br />Basically , this film is just bad . I really did n't want it to be bad , but it is . Bad in just so many ways . And to make matters worse , this is n't a film with not enough budget . It 's not a film with too short a schedule . It 's not a film that 's been rushed out . It 's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside . This is exactly the film the Wachowski 's set out to make with Warner 's fortune fully behind them . And that 's what makes this so awful . At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it did n't haev enough time or money.<br /><br />Matrix Reloaded . The worst film ever made ? Maybe not quite . The most disappointing and defalting film ever made.<br /><br />Undeniably.<br /><br / >
0 I tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler . I also assume that you 've seen the first movie or at least know the general gist , so if you have n't some of this might not make sense.<br /><br />Plot : This movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across . We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose , and destiny , and choice , and forced to endure the long , torturous platitude sessions that contain them.<br /><br />Neo , awakened from a dream in the last movie , now begins a period of realization about his own existence . There are a lot of revelations in this movie , which I 'll be vague about so they wo n't seem like spoilers.<br /><br />*If you 're still worried vague references will spoil the movie , do n't read the paragraph below.*<br /><br />The strength and weakness of faith is revealed . The strengths and weaknesses of love , and its temporary nature , are also revealed . The interdependence of humans and technology , and our faith in technology , are also revealed . The importance of choice and experience is revealed . Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail , so I will refrain ( as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks ) . Btw , by " revealed " I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails.<br /><br />Storyline : So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one ? In short , they keep the faith , and use and abuse overly - stylized action and bullet - time like it 's going out of style ( and after this display , I 'm hoping movie - goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more ) . More on that later . To not spoil anything , I will say no more than the promo material already did : Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix , and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans , and Zion , all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts . The movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off.<br /><br />Action : While martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts , this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay , adding swords , sais , etc . to the mix . Special effects are so often used and waved in the audience 's face that it becomes really tiresome . I 've discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike , and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences -- especially the " Smith fight " we all heard would be in the movie -- to be too long and tedious . This is a huge red flag for action fans , because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more , or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured.<br /><br />These fights scenes do neither . They are over - stylized , over - the - top sequences that are wooden and uninspired . In the first movie , there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action , a sense that fighting was for survival , not just looking good ( which I honestly do n't think they manage in Reloaded anyway ) in black and leather . Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are -- you wo n't regret it . In addition , the " Matrix abilities " people have in Reloaded is not consistent , and what they actually do is not consistent . The first movie had its inconsistencies here , but they were n't too glaring -- unlike Reloaded.<br /><br />Special effects are poured on and on and on . Every little thing someone does , be it just jump , somersault , spin , and in many cases just pose , are < br /><br />slow - moed , bullet - timed , or over - accentuated by some sort of destruction . It 's evident the W Bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie , and boy did they throw it , with no real restraint . Sharp editors could have really helped this , but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given , which brings us to . . .<br /><br />Character and dialogue : I have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes . Actors ca n't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience 's face , or neglecting it altogether . The audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own.<br /><br />Keanu 's acting performance is stiff at best . Keanu is good at acting confused , and that 's about all he does in this film . He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity , but it falls flat.<br /><br />Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V , and be as cool as a cat throughout . With the script he is provided , he makes a noble attempt , but it also falls flat.<br /><br />Moss is n't very believable either . Her look of concern is always the same , much like Keanu 's , and the chemistry is n't there , although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough.<br /><br />Hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an Agent program , but he too suffered from the script 's hand . I actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch , but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge , drawn out fight scene.<br /><br />All in all , this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations , and on its own , as a stand - alone movie ( which is not how it 's supposed to be taken ) , it 's still horrible . I do n't see The Matrix as deep , but I at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas , good action , a few funny lines , and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive . Reloaded fails on all these counts , and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment . Granted , I do n't have a lot of hope left for that after this film .
0 The first Matrix movie was lush with incredible character development , witty dialog , and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story . These elements -- coupled by incredible special effects of the day -- presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time . Enter Matrix Reloaded ( and its sequel , Revolutions ) . The problem here is n't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue ; The brothers have taken well - developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs .   The connection that was first established between viewers and on - screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first Matrix movie.<br /><br />To wit , Morpheus was developed as a charismatic , philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie , but here in Reloaded -- we 're presented by a different Morpheus who stands hard and hollow , reduced to corny one - liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film . This character just did n't feel the same , and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie.<br /><br />The removal of ' Tank ' was also a disappointment . Tank 's involvement in the first film was minimal at best , but he played the role extremely well . In Reloaded , we discover that Tank dies after the events in the first film , and he is replaced by a Jar Jar Binks stunt double that could n't act to save his live ( think stale box of Kellogg 's Corn Flakes ) . His performance left me chuckling throughout , and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing . There was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on - screen or the delivery in the script was off ; in either case , the experience was humorous ! At times I felt embarrassed for the actor .... <br /><br />Even Neo 's Godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences . The alleyway battle with the 200 Agent Smith clones was certainly exaggerated . One must wonder , for a man so gifted as Neo -- that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless , frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend ( especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the Matrix ; certainly Neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker , and more efficiently ) . Again , such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency , and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped . In jest , our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly . Sadly , for those expecting more of the same -- you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed.<br /><br />However , if you take Reloaded as your standard , run - of - the - mill action movie , and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already - established character development from the first film , you should walk away feeling quite pleased .
0 1/10 and that 's only because I do n't go lower with my ratings.<br /><br />skip this " movie " and wait for the last movie of the " Trilogy " , do n't buy or rent it . trust me you wo n't be missing a thing . the Architect brings no new info : _ ( spoiler ) _ there have been more NEO 's before him , he 's like nr.6 or something . you could already figure something like that out from the first movie : Agent Smith telling us the first Matrix created did n't work because it was too perfect . Trinity died and Neo 's " love " brought her back , where have I seen this before ? Oh right in the first movie the roles where reversed ! same as the action - scenes nothing new just with more opponents . the Action - scene ( the 20 + ships ) in the BIG battle which we did n't see ( maybe in Revolutions ? ) , betrayed by someone ( hmmmm , maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab Neo ? ! ) who pushed the EGM - button to soon.<br /><br />all in all a shameless ploy to make money ( especially off the guys who went to see it more then once ) , which evidently worked like a charm .
0 Man would expect that a movie shot with an approx . budget of 300,000,000 U$D should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it . " Matrix Reloaded " proves this assumption wrong.<br /><br />"The Matrix " worked out better , despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story . At least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot ( aka agent ) inside a simulation ( aka martix ) would harm the responsible computer program in any way ... <br /><br />Unfortunately , the Wachowski brothers made excactly this " agent - bashing " the main thing in " Matrix Reloaded " : it 's a beat 'em up o - rama . This fighting scenes may be work out sufficient ( or even cool ) in a 5 sec . trailer , but prolonged for several minutes , apparently being faked , choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring . Despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low - quality , unimaginative bashing already seen ( or better not ) in eg . Van Damme ' movies ' . The difference of post - production ( etherything is 5 times faster , the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes , and this is repeated for at least 5min ) does n't help here , all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of " martial arts " . Beside these ' fights ' , all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for : acting.<br /><br />What 's up besides the fighting scenes ? Few except Hollywood routine . This oh - so - multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in " Waterworld " are recycled as citizen of " Zion " ( mans last city on earth ) , and on the order of Morpheus they start dancing , 'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts . The oh - so - popular clichée of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this " je ne sais quoi " dumb accent , who wastes his fortune because of a " liason d'amour " is bravely served . Following this ( and unwanted funny ) is the fight between Neo and the sinister followers of ' the frog ' , since it takes place in an Erroy Flynn like enterieur , luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration . For Neo posing with the hellebarde , just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues ( for being destructed , thrown over evil guys and the like ) and you get 5 more senseless , boring min . of this junk.<br /><br />Whats left to expect ? The usual merchandising hell . And " revolutions " which will happen or not - certainly without me .
0 ` The Matrix ' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its ` Twilight Zone'-ish manner . The general rule applies here- and this sequel does n't match up to its predecessor . Worse than that , it does n't even compare with it.<br /><br />`Reloaded ' explodes onto the screen in the most un - professional fashion . In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream . Immediately after that , the film nose - dives . After a disastrous first 45 minutes , it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place . But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan - worthy twist at the end . Worst of all is the overlong ` Zion Rave ' scene . Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot , but it 's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.<br /><br />The bullet - time aspect of ` The Matrix ' was a good addition , but in ` ' Reloaded ' they overuse to make it seem boring . In the first one there were interesting plot turns , but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting . The movie is basically , just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is . It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better . It appears that ` The Matrix ' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the ` Star Wars ' saga have.<br /><br />The acting standard is poor for the most part . The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving 's ` Agent Smith'- the only one to be slightly interesting . Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo , but in all the special effects , there is little room to make much of an impact . Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue . Carrie Ann Moss ' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress . < br /><br />A poor , thrown - together movie , ` The Matrix Reloaded ' is a disappointment . Those who did n't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it . This one 's for die - hard fans only . Even in the movie 's own sub - genre of special effect bonanzas ( Minority Report , The Matrix etc . ) this is still rather poor . My IMDb rating : 4.5/10 .
0 I felt asleep , watching it ! ! ! ( and I had tickets for the midnight- premiere ) Any questions ? The most disturbing scene , as far as I can remember , was the techno - dance - i - dont - know - what - that - was - scene . By the way what an ending ! ?
0 As a fan of Science - fiction movies , I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999 . From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it , I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated . I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland . I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released . With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded , it was time to buy the DVD and watch it.<br /><br />The disappointment was too great . The premise of the matrix ( the controlling device as opposed to the movie ) was clever . The philosophical premise of parallel worlds , alternate realities is shopworn . However , I could still have bought into the film , as science - fiction , if it stayed firmly in that genre . Unfortunately , it turned into a standard , " will they or wo n't they escape , break through , rescue those in need of rescue , etc . " To make matters worse , it turned out to be another martial arts exercise . The problem is that science - fiction and martial arts films are really two different types . To the purest , the devotee of one or the other , mixing the two does n't work . It is like mixing science - fiction with romance . You can have one or the other , but not both in the same film , or , at least , not both to the same extent in the same movie.<br /><br />If there were such problems with The Matrix , The Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problems . At least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car - chase . ( This observation ignores the question , made in every professional , negative review of the movie : If Neo could do the Superman thing , why bother to fight at all ? The answer , of course , is that 's what draws the young , male demographic group into the theatre . ) Then there is the " redemption through love " aspect . That plot device was worn out by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago . It was actually handled better by him in Die Gotterdammerung.<br /><br />So where does that leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded . Martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite , but arcane sci - fi philosophizing . Science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung - fun fest . Most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film.<br /><br />Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films : Science fiction , martial arts , or soap opera ? A bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them , nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each .
0 What the hell was all that about ? I saw The Matrix and was amazed . It was the most spectacular movie ever made . What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me.<br /><br />There is no plot , you ca n't argue with that . Basically all this film was was a load of talking , and do n't get me wrong , I have no problem with talky films , but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle . Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long , then more pointless drivvle , then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti - climax ever . A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes.<br /><br />Also , Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet . I knew he was n't a good actor but this was beyond a joke . If you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along . God knows what his performance is like in Something 's Got ta Give ! Keanu Reeves : The only plank of wood ever to become an actor.<br /><br />After the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment . If you have n't already seen the first film I suggest you watch it , but do n't waste your time with this utter pile of turd.<br /><br / >
0 It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels . It 's where the first novel ( Dune , Ender 's Game ) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story . The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make . The Matrix is finally the film equivalent . The Matrix stands tall , alone , as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle . Seeing this cash cow just sitting there , and wanting to explore other aspects of society , the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non - action sequences in SciFi . While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies , the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel . Watch for eye candy , not for deep thought.<br /><br />4 out of 10 , as registered by this fine website .
0 As soon as I began to see posters and hear talk about this movie , I was immediately excited . The Matrix was an incredible to behold and I could n't wait to see the second one , especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies . However , when I saw it , I left the theater extremely disappointed , as did many other movie - goers at the theater with me . While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always , there simply were too few of them . In the first movie , there was constant fighting going on it seemed , but the second took a much more ( and much unfortunate ) preachy point of view . To sum up the plot , there was n't much to it that was n't expected . The machines were digging toward Zion with intent of destroying it ( that 's not a spoiler , everyone saw it in the commercials ) . The dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous . Unless you 're a psychology major , you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie , and because of that simply wo n't care . It became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of Neo and Trinity . Agent Smith , for as bad - ass as he was in the first movie , seemed to get all religious and preachy . Personally , I do n't need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it . The movie was a serious waste of my time , and I do n't think I can watch the first one anymore . The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly , and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge , and the ending of the movie shoved me right off . What movie ends with " To Be Concluded " ? How original is that folks . I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one . In conclusion , the movie was bad and that 's the end of it .
0 I 'll admit that I liked the first one , and was really looking forward to the sequel.<br /><br />I was let down . Sure the special effects were technically amazing -- but they were n't believable looking . It looked more like a cartoon . Alright , I admit to liking 80 % of the chase scene -- but the fight with all the Mr Smiths ? It was too obviously animated.<br /><br />I can accept all of that . What I ca n't accept is that the non - action parts were crap . Every time Morpheus opened his mouth , I knew I was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist . What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie ( except about the existence of the matrix ) . This movie was a little like seeing the episode of DALLAS where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream.<br /><br />Ugh ! I want my $ 7.00 back !
0 A perfect little atrocity ... I doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary - MTV 4.4 seconds . Woeful casting , worse even than in Kusminsky 's version ( a reminder : he managed to miscast Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes ) . But , hey - the rich got what they deserved . Dark and brooding Heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden - locked angel , frail and angellic Catherine presented as a chubby , melon - breasted heffer , meek and weak Linton is a peeping tom , and innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle - Gellar 's character from Cruel Intentions . 15-year old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners - take notice . This thing was made for you . It is an hour - and - a - half long music video where everything is given to you ; you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters , but even from initial shock at their actions . The actors tried , but , as I stated before , they were miscasted . Decent photography , but editing is on the level of TV production class in high school . I implore you all : read the book , or the cliffnotes even ; watch the previous versions of it , even Kusminsky 's ; but stay away from the numerous future reruns , during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial - free premiere .
0 I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Kline - esque commercials , but thought I 'd give it a chance . So I 've watched it , and all I can say is bleh . This movie was so bad . It 's rare that I hate a movie this much . Watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman 's " The Player , " when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers . I 'd like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of Bronte ( but this time Heathcliff 's name is Heath and he 's a rock star , and Hindley 's name is Hendrix ) would be a good idea.<br /><br />Even that might not have been so bad , had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well . The direction must have been " you 're lonely , pout for me . " I laughed out loud during all the " serious " scenes and was bored throughout the rest . The camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy . My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom -- all I could hear in half the scenes were the waves . And in the other scenes , I wish that 's all I could hear . And speaking of sound , what they did to the Sisters of Mercy song " More " is absolutely inexcusable , then again , it 's inexcusable what they did to Bronte.<br /><br />On the bright side , there was one entertaining scene -- specifically the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl 's face -- and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you .
0 Let me start off by saying that I did n't watch this movie at first with high expectations . It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies , and " MTV " was pasted on the front cover so I was not expecting much . What i was expecting was a tear - jerker , overly dramatic but at least effective.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Firstly , let me start off that I had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie.<br /><br />The acting was my main gripe with the film . By god is it AWFUL . The main girl is pretty mediocre , but when compared to the rest of the cast she 's Maryl Streep . The main " Hero " , Heath , is just plain awful . He can sing decent sounding clichéd songs , but that 's about it . His acting broke the ' sad ' moments by being so bad at points that I just burst into laughter . The Isabel girl was pretty godawful too , and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that could n't display emotion whatsoever . And when he tried to , it failed miserably . Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor , playing Edward , although it 's obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what I 've seen him do . Oh , and the father was n't half - bad to my memory , but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time I can hardly remember.<br /><br />The story itself was not very good . More breakups than you can imagine . Predictable story ( Until the ending , which I barely understood ) . EXTREMELY one - sided characters with no real depth to them ... Overall just not interesting or compelling , nothing we 've never seen before done MUCH better , and nothing worth watching here.<br /><br />The ending is suppose to be a tearjerker . It did nothing of the sort . The ending is n't built up at all , it almost feels like an afterthought . In fact , I had to ask my friends WHY the ending actually happened , which when they explained it to me I must have had a look on my face of " Wait , when did they say that ? What ? " . Never a good sign . The editing was probably the worst I 've seen , though I do understand the fade - ins - fade - outs are done because this was originally made for TV , but that 's really no excuse.<br /><br />Overall , the movie is just garbage . I 'm a sensitive guy , I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons . I never cried during this crap , not even close . Really , this movie is not worth your time . If you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere .
0 There 's no denying the first Azumi film was a commercial product ; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young , attractive actors and certainly was n't lacking in the budget department . Yet it more than entertained for what it was , and I ca n't deny I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />"Azumi 2 " lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful . The first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm . With him , he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics , but the originals style , beauty and most importantly , its heart . While the first had a simple " hitlist " plot , this one has a corkscrew mess of a story , with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated . Gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters ; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest . Characterisation is non existent ; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies , I 'll be shocked . The same applies to the villains here . The final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension . The fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness . The villains themselves try far too hard to be campy , and even if they were all combined , they do n't come within a country mile of the Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri in the original.<br /><br />####Major Spoiler at end of paragraph ! # # # # # < br /><br />Aya Ueto tries her best it has to be said , and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films . Azumi is now a fully fledged assassin , meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion ; unfortunately , now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mysteriousness , Ueto 's model looks become even more inappropriate . I know this is supposed to be the point , but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film , the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around . The less said about Chiaki " Remember me from Kill Bill " Kuriyama 's performance the better ; it suffices to say her " turn " from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm.<br /><br />Overall , this was just a colossal disappointment . Any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film . A lazy , unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess .
0 You like beautiful girls ? Yeah me too . What is there bad to say about beautiful girls / women ? Nothing imo , so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5 , although it got the " talents " of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto ? < br /><br />If I really wanted to watch beautiful people , I 'd watch MTV or something that 's why . This is a movie , a so called action movie nevertheless . So by definition it does not even really need a plot right ? I 'm not agreeing 100 % , but let 's say yes to that . So what does it need ? 20 minutes footage from part 1 ( I might be exaggerating a little bit , but it felt like more than 20 minutes ... ) ? ! That would be " No " . But then again you never know , the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast , so hey let 's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice ? Just to be sure they wo n't forget ... at least until the credits roll , of course ! ! ! ! < br /><br />So forget about the story , about character development , about real emotions , about the " acting " ( and no , I do n't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting ! ) ... what does that leave ? Yes the action scenes . The action scenes are not bad and that 's the reason I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 ! I was giving this movie a chance , but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / watch , believe me ...
0 I ca n't believe I actually sat through the whole thing . This movie has the worst acting since Killjoy.<br /><br />Here is a brief outline of the plot : The movie starts out with Jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach , drooling over a skinny blonde - haired beach " hunk " who looks like he has n't been to the gym a day in his life . Somehow , everyone knows him , and every single chick in the movie wants him . UH OH ! Here comes the competition ! The stereotypical " hot chick " and her best friends , who drive an ugly pink car . We soon find out Jojo 's mom got the job of a lifetime in Australia , which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind ( oh no , I think I 'm gon na cry ) . A huge storm comes , and fills their swimming pool with nasty water . Somehow , for no apparent reason , the little chick falls into the pool , and comes face to face with , yup , you guessed it , a MERMAID ! This is where the " story " really takes off . Basically , they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the " hunk".<br /><br />This is a preteen flick with acting so bad , it makes the 80 's look like the pinnacle of Oscar - worthy performances . This movie has all the clichés possible ... the best friends , the " hunk " who everyone wants , the " hot " bad girl and her bitchy friends , the scary old man ... you name it , it 's in there . I took one for a lot of people by watching this . Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you . Please , do n't see this movie . Do n't make it so I suffered in vain .
0 If I write a review about a movie , maybe it will stick with me ... but generally I expect that I will have forgotten I 've seen this one a mere two weeks from now . So why bother ? Because again I find myself watching a low - rated movie that was fun to watch . I did n't expect I 'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on.<br /><br />It was n't great , but at least it was not unbearable ... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe . It was just sweet fluff ... and if you ca n't take it , stay in the locker room boys . I agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic , and wo n't be a total bore to an adult.<br /><br />It offers a few good chuckles here and there , but nary a side splitter . Sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining , but at least it does n't suck ( as so many have said it does ) . Maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides ? < br /><br />I have a tendency to grade on the bell curve , so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all - around rating in my book . Giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing . Giving it a 1 or a 10 , as most have done thus far , makes the rating numbers meaningless . I can not believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff ( or that I am even bothering to write about it ) . Am I missing something ? < br /><br />Anyway , it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly . Ariell Kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due . You might also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard , though his role is ancillary.<br /><br />Surely you can miss this one if you are an adult . But , if there is a pre - teen girl in your life , rent this movie for her ... and be prepared NOT to hate it ( you might even enjoy it ) .
0 A half - hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day , but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo - Playboy magazine subplot , Presley is surrounded by the same old coy , winking clichés . A woman picks E.P. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life -- and he does n't seem to care ! Dick Sargent is grueling in another sidebar , but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee ( ! ) try hard as Elvis ' two bosses ( he 's moonlighting , you see ) . Some of the songs are quite good , especially " Almost in Love " , but if you want to see a looser , hipper , updated Elvis sex - comedy -- look elsewhere . When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction get into bed together , there 's actually a wooden board in between them ! Get real . * * from * * * *
0 When I was seventeen I genuinely believed Elvis to be the king of rock and roll , and not only did I wish to see all 31 of his " character " movies , but it was my ambition to own them , too . What an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen - year - old I must have been . Thankfully sense prevailed and Live A Little , Love A Little is the only Elvis film I own.<br /><br />The spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song A Little Less Conversation has been released as a single . ( His first to reach the UK top ten in 22 years  his first UK No.1 in 25 ) Even when I was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help I realised that the songs for this movie were n't exactly first rate . However , A Little Less Conversation - rollnecks and 60s grooving aside - is a real standout . Finding a lesser - known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions . It 's nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated , but it 's also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult . ( And what chauvinistic lyrics , too . Though what other Elvis song contains the word " procrastinate"?)<br /><br />But what really bothers me about this film is not A Little Less Conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it . Actually based on a novel ( Kiss My Firm But Pliant Lips - what kind of lame novel would that be ? ) this one sees a bored Elvis holed up with a " comedy " dog and a nympho . Within 90 seconds of meeting him , Michele Carey asks " would you like to make love to me ? " Quite a fast mover by any standards I 'm sure you 'll agree.<br /><br />I do seem to recall that some of Elvis 's early movies - most notably Jailhouse Rock and King Creole - were n't too bad , but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers . Being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts , causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh , and models dress as pink mermaids . There 's even a dream sequence for God 's sake . Maybe the only dumb stereotype it does n't conform to is in not having all that many songs . With just four to choose from , including the credits number , you 're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks . Some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes , but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain . Of the remaining three tracks , then The Edge of Reality is n't actually that bad , though Elvis 's dance to it must surely have been called " The Bear Trap".<br /><br />In one sense , for a PG certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content . Sadly , however , with talking dogs , Middle America sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you 'll ever see , Elvis 's dignity is obliterated by this movie .
0 LIVE A LITTLE , LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis ' weirdest movies . Part slapstick , part fluff , part surreal and part strange . Elvis meets up with a very off - beat girl with an annoying voice . She looks like Jennifer Aniston . Story does n't make much sense as is the case with most Elvis Presley movies , and there a bunch of odd characters galore . Not much music in this one , but what there is I liked , although none are memorable . Strange continuity . Elvis and Michelle Carey go into her beach house at night , but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it 's stark daylight ! ! What ? ? That 's about the essence of the movie . What ? ? Oh , two good things about the movie : A ) Elvis looks great and B ) the dog steals the show .
0 This is easily the worst Presley vehicle ever , which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made . It is measurably worse than even the revolting " Happy Ending " song at the end of " It Happened At The World 's Fair " , and here I thought that moment when Elvis buys all of the vendor 's balloons for his girl , and then the balloon vendor gets jiggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped . I usually enjoy the random Elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it . This one , however , ought to be called " Live a Little , Wish You Were Dead a Little " , and makes " Stay Away Joe " look like Olivier playing Othello.<br /><br />Here , Elvis plays Greg , who is essentially a hippie free - lance photographer except for the Establishment haircut . After a fun morning of reckless driving , he ends up at the beach where he is abducted by a woman who 's name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her . Clearly Michele Carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic Elizabeth Taylor ( if I watched this without my glasses , I would have thought it was late 1960 's Liz playing the female lead ) . She sics her dog on Elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia , then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him ( the audience does not know about it either , until Elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie , and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house).<br /><br />Rather than having her arrested for kidnapping , larceny and assault , he goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent Miss Crazy Pants had to spring for when stealing all of his belongings . Job one is working for Don Porter at a Playboy type magazine , job two is upstairs working for Rudy Vallee at a snobby fashion magazine . I think the two - job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy , too bad it is n't the least bit funny , unless you 'd laugh the 100th time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast - motion to silly music . The predominate obstacle that keeps Greg from falling for his abductor is her other love interest , the dreadfully miscast Dick Sargent ( let 's face it , either Porter or Vallee , even given their advanced ages in 1968 , would have made far more believable competitors for Miss Crazy 's affections).<br /><br />There are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns , I kept waiting for something , anything to happen that would make all of this make sense . It never did . Entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of Elvis ' rendition of " A Little Less Talk " ( which I can listen to on CD without this painful movie inflicted upon me ) and a funny five second bit where Elvis flops on the couch and Crazy Pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it . That 's it , folks , busted furniture , the only laugh in this entire film . No amount of mod sixties clothing , music , or décor can salvage this high - heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs . Viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self - infliction of grave bodily harm .
0 This film is really something of a curate 's egg , good in parts . In contrast to other reviewers , I found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewer 's interest in the characters and the plot . I sat through it because I 'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands , but if I were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie , I would have to give it the thumbs down , with a few caveats : Jason Behr is good in the part of John Livien , and quite convincing as a rock singer ; the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear , although we are given hints in Livien 's well - acted relationship to his parents , but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer ( which it should n't be ) . Nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting , albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film . The allusions to John Lennon were irritating , but I confess I 'm not a Beatles fan . At any rate , Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles , in the sense that there was something derivative about them . Another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting - albeit middlebrow and high - school level - philosophical musings of the lead character , but left the threads of his thinking there , only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly , when Livien says , " before God , there was music " ( ever seen that ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s , " Before time , there was Tia Maria " ? That 's what sprung to mind anyway ) ; it seems an idiotic conclusion , and the viewer has no idea how he reached it , but he 's entitled to it . Fortunately his bassist and friend , played ably by Dominic Monaghan , seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds " You do n't know that".<br /><br />In all , the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects , into pointless banality or into an interesting and more mature perspective .
0 Yet another film about a tortured self - centered , arrogant , unfeeling hateful , self - destructive lead character we are supposed to care about.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly self - destructive character . What I object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy . Why did this guy hate himself and the world ? Had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for him . As it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character , not tragic , just hateful.<br /><br />After taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and anti - social as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending .... <br /><br />This is not the worst film I have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight ! Man ! Do n't waste your time .
0 A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom . It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien 's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche . Instead , it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien 's life with John Lennon 's . John Livien 's suicida mother 's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself . Instead of focusing on John Lennon 's musical brilliance , and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life , it showed Lennon 's legacy to be that of a confused , drug addicted soul , who should looked upon as a God instead a man . I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another " crazy " person obsessed with Lennon , Lennon 's killer , Mark David Chapman . Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon . Do we need to be reminded of that ? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person , as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon , and not show his beautiful contributions to the world . Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon 's memory , by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects , and remember John . Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide . I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon 's memory . He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death , and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan . It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie , but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth . Let John Lennon , and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie .
0 This is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed . The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much at the premiere . This is a drama , but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was . That 's never a good sign . The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien 's roommates / bandmates . They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously . The cheesy dropping of Beatles lyrics was just absurd . The soundtrack was excellent , however , and was probably the best part of the movie . Unless you 're one of those crazy , rabid Dominic Monaghan fans , do n't bother with this one .
0 First of all , I apologize for my English . < br /><br />Everybody from ex - Yugoslavia who is n't some extreme Serbian radical will agree with me . This movie , shows Serbian side , and only Serbian side . No Serbian crimes were represented . Luckily , everyone can see that this movie was made by Serbians , so there is no neutrality . All ' ' professionals '' who were interviewed are not professionals at all . Some guy only read a book written by some radical Serbian , the other one is genocide denier etc.etc.<br /><br />Even Slovenians were accused in this movie . And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for few days , and only because Slovenians were lucky . There were n't many Serbs in Slovenia , and YNA could n't reach Slovenia trough Croatia ( after Croatia - Serbia war started ) . Every Slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie . < br /><br />Every reasonable Croat will agree with one thing : The independence was too early . Perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided . However , mentioning WWII and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything . Just imagine Japanese throwing nuclear bombs at Seattle and Washington , and saying that was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki . You will find no evidence about strangled YNA soldier , and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar . But you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about Serbian civilians near Vukovar were lies . All over the internet . And the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of Vukovar by YNA ( now on Serbian and Montenegro side - and 100 % full of Serbs and Montenegrin ) And let 's not start about the Chetnik movement . At the beginning , it was simply a resistance movement . But director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the Nazis , including Ustashe , ethnic cleansing , and fighting again the Yugoslav partisans . There are thousands of other things , but all of it can be easily checked . There are many misleading things in this movie . Only few of all accusations are true . Every Croatian is outraged by this movie . < br /><br />I believe that I do n't need to mention Srebrenica genocide denial , the genocide that has too many evidence . Imagine the movie about holocaust denial . This movie is the same . And according to this movie Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves . Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this movie . < br /><br />Somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of Macedonian ( FYROM ) land by the Serbs . < br /><br />Croatians , Slovenians , Bosnians , and Macedonians never entered Serbian borders . If you are not Serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie , know that Serbs have some kind of propaganda that Croats , Bosnian Muslims , and Macedonians are actually Serbs who made up their history . So ... <br /><br />Even 50 % of Serbs will say that this movie is ' ' little '' extreme and pro - Serbian . < br /><br />And Serbian radicals are very , very pleased with this movie ( there is about 40 % Serbs who vote for radicals).<br /><br />I think everyone understands my points in here . In this so called documentary is very little truth , and my advice to everyone is : Inform yourself before watching this movie . After that , you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations.<br /><br />Watch real , neutral documentaries about death of Yugoslavia .
0 do n't watch this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/<br /><br />The Death of Yugoslavia documentary series ( of five episodes ) is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass - bloodshed which marked the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990 's . It includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both " Yugoslav " and otherwise . The only real " improvement " which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was made . This was indeed done in the late 1990 's for a repeat showing on BBC television , but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work . Perhaps another whole episode might be warranted ? The very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term " Yugoslavia " by the now - named Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before.<br /><br />not fiction like in " Yugoslavia : The Avoidable War ( 1999 ) "
0 Before seeing this movie , please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie 's falsification of events , particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7 - 8,000 Muslim men were bused out of Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitaries . The documentarian also belongs to various pro - Serbian American organizations . Please watch this movie critically , and read reviews beforehand . Most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far , even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war . A review in the NYTimes by Stephen Holden states that it would be " inaccurate to label this documentary pro - Serbian , " but one should question both the presentation of facts , many of which are taken from reliable sources , and the omission of those facts that inculpate Serbian forces . I do not advise against seeing this documentary , but I do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye ( as one should do at all times anyway ) .
0 When I saw this " documentary " , I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again . Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup , it is not mentioned in this " documentary " , which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective . It is one in the set of lies pushed by Milosevic regime . Everyone else is guilty only Serbians were right and victims , even though most of the War Criminals tried in Hague are Serbs , even though Serbs are one who have committed genocide against Bosnians , and attacked Slovenia , Croatia , and Bosnia all independent nations recognized by the UN.Breakup of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because Serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on Federal Yugoslav government , so SLovenia , Croatia , Macedonia , and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests . If you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of Yugoslavia , and fact led documentary this is not it . You should watch " Yugoslavia : Death of a Nation " , Made by Discovery channel and BBC .
0 I just want to say that this production is very one sided , breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously . < br /><br />There are no credits of the persons they interviewed , so you ca nt have an idea if they are worthy of being heard.<br /><br />Tells the story from just one point of view . To do this is very dangerous , because the next generations learns the bad idea , and that s why wars keep coming . I know this is not the only reason about wars , but does n't help either.<br /><br />you can watch this documentary , but read in the internet a lot , before . Balcans are complex as human history is .
0 There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that : < br /><br />1 ) The people who made this documentary ( including the director and the producer ) are Serbs or of Serbian origin , therefore the criteria of neutrality fails . For instance , they mentioned that the diaspora Croats ( the so called " Ustase " ) played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia , but they did n't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well ( Cetniks ) ! For you who are n't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history : The Serbian so called " Cetniks " that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war . Well , that 's only half the truth . They were also a fascist ( Monarch ) group who collaborated with the Germans , but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war . It 's also ironic that they do n't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary , a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia . But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic ... Hm ... Allow me to be just a little suspicious.<br /><br />2 ) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown . And I 've studied this war for a long time ( who is the old British lady ! ! ! She really has n't made her homework ! ) and they are not even presented by name , so they could More or less be anybody , maybe someone they took from the street . Who knows.<br /><br />3 ) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages , and therefore it should belong to Serbia ( even though they are a minority ) . Well , when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia ( Krajina ) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long . Fine , but what people do n't know is that the largest city in Krajina ( Knin ) has great historical importance for the Croatian people . It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history ( Zvonimir ) was crowned , and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia . The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later ! But no , the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary . Is that fair ? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director . Plus , it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution did n't have any laws about minority rights , this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority.<br /><br />4 ) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas . Or the Muslim radical Oric . They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war . Yes , they were radicals , but if you want to talk about radicals , why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan ? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them , just so that people get an overview of the documentary . It looks like the people who made this documentary were n't well prepared and did n't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something . There are n't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality , but the best so far is " The death of Yugoslavia " where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed ( e.g. Milosevic , Jovic , Bulatovic , Tudman , Izetbegovic , Karadzic etc . ) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war.<br /><br />One other thing . I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country ( Bosnia ) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war . Well , first of all , all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims did n't have an old ethnic identity ( previosly they were called " Muslim Croats " ) they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people , and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common : Their religion . And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them . They had to fight the 4:th largest army in Europe ! They needed all the help they could get . Nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war . History has shown us that .
0 And how it made it into production astounds me . The main character is an obnoxious show off who is n't the least bit funny . I ca n't stand the character at all . He 's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show . < br /><br />This is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years , no joke . The story lines are both poorly written and executed . The jokes are as bad as the ones on Disney 's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody . I could not dislike this show more , it 's terrible and should be canceled . Even the theme song is bad . The title , even worse.<br /><br />It 's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they 're hot stuff when they 're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor.<br /><br />Johnny Test , go away far and fast !
0 This show is dull , lame , and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it " original . " First off : The animation is so ugly ... Johnny 's hideous ... and everyone 's annoying . The twins look like teen female Dexters from " Dexter 's Lab , " and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee ( also from " Dexter 's Lab . " ) Secondly : The plots ... are painfully lame , making them hard to follow . The gags are corny , and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit ... especially when it tries to be funny . I only saw two episodes , but those alone turned me off.<br /><br />Third off : The whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to Green Day 's " American Idiot . " And , while I am not a big fan of that band , I find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody , and then subtly change it , in order to make it their own.<br /><br />Case in point ... it 's a big fat ugly bore . 1/10
0 I had recently been watching Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in it . I failed , horribly . Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences , but Johnny Test is " entertainment " in it 's lowest form . The writing is incredibly predictable , and the running gags are n't much gags at all . Kids will love it , and that 's about it.<br /><br />Now , this is n't to say that it 's all bad . The original opening theme was actually pretty catchy , but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat . It 's a shame , because that was really one of the best things it had going for it.<br /><br />Some of the characters could be very interesting , in theory . With a little work , the characters could work well together , but they 're too one - dimensional . Then again , this makes it easy for the kids to follow . < br /><br />The pace is a bit too fast as well . The episodes are too busy , leaving little time for clever writing . This is a real shame , because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth . On the upside , however , the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest , and that 's really the entirety of the target audience.<br /><br />Overall , the show looks very good on paper , but just does n't succeed in being funny or interesting . This is a show I want to like , but I 'm incapable of it . There 's just so much potential that is n't realized . Kids will enjoy it , but that 's about it .
0 I want so badly to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero , unfortunately , there is n't , so , I had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is ! The characters look like they were drawn by pre - schoolers , no , wait , I 've seen pre - schoolers do better ! I prefer " Misadventures of Flapjack " to this terrible excuse for a cartoon ! I 'm probably saying what others have said , two words : RIP OFF ! ! Remember that episode of Dexter 's Lab when they raced go - karts down that volcano ? yeah , Mister Fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed ! They even ripped off Shadow Lugia in that one episode that parodied Pokemon!(he even cashed in on that franchise ! ) That one character is a cheap rip off of Mandark from Dexter 's Lab ! Mister Fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap ! ! Everyone has their own opinion , but those of you who like Johnny ( RIP - OFF ) Test , your'e just lying to yourselves . Do yourself a favor , change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen !
0 As you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that I do n't like Johnny Test . Now I think I know what people are going to say , " How do you know how bad it is ? Have you ever watched it ? " , I did watch this show a couple times because I am studying film and animation and this just does n't hold a candle to my standards.<br /><br />I want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things I have ever seen . Like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation . I thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.<br /><br />So that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show . It tries way too hard to be like Dexter 's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female . There is a talking dog(why ? ) , and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat . I have others but I do n't think I can write them here ( I do n't mean cursing but I mean I do n't know if there is a limit for words . ) . Everything else though is spot on , even a DeeDee character Johnny himself . It just tries so hard to be Dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.<br /><br />Lastly I want to talk about the jokes . Remember in Dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling ? Yes , yelling can be good for a joke or two but Dexter 's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke . Johnny Test just forgets all that and just yells 50 % of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears . That is n't comedy , that s stupid comedy ( I know what some people are thinking . Is n't three stooges stupid comedy ? Watch that and Johnny Test back to back and you laugh more at the first option . ) . Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which , like Chowder , makes me mad . I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together : To much bizarre does n't equal comedy , it makes you just think " what am I watching?".<br /><br />So it strikes out on all accounts . Do n't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway , shape , or form .
0 This show is possibly the biggest , ugliest , most generic steam pile I 've seen in children 's programming that 's actually become successful . The lead character , Johnny , while I understand he 's supposed to represent an ordinary kid , is n't likable or even tolerable . The jokes are lame , overdone ( i.e. the " Whoa ! Did n't see that coming " gag . Come on , that was n't even funny the first time . It 's not even cute ) and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration . And lastly ... it 's just plain ugly to look at . While kids are n't especially critical of artistic talent , they still prefer eye candy . I ca n't stand watching the show , because in a way , the art style is just ... gross . Hideous , in fact . Just plain crummy . < br /><br />I just ca n't stand that this is getting so much airtime . While I understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and I should n't be getting my hopes up on it coming back ... I really miss the old cartoons . Bring back Dexter 's Laboratory , The Powerpuff Girls ... anything but this crap . I guess it 's just wishful thinking though.<br /><br />Simply put , I advise you do n't waste your time on this show . I believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids , too . And this does n't cut it .
0 I really hate this show ! I had watched one episode , and I knew this show is really terrible . The story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad ... I mean it is just a sh++ty rip - off of Dexter 's Laboratory and Johnny Quest , 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog ; a stay - at - home dad and a smart , super - busy mom ... Like oh - my - flippin'-God ! Their dad is a mother - f**kin ' crazy home - maker , is n't that so gay ! If my dad is a home - maker , I would personally die ! Of shame that is ... Really I would.<br /><br />I have nothing else to about this ... this travesty but only 3 word ; count them 3 words to describe it:<br /><br / > · Lame , · Stupid , and above all ... · F**K UP ! That 's all I could say folks , it is definitely making my list of worst animated series EV - ER ! If I had one that is .
0 My brother is in love with this show , let 's get this straight . I completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of Dexter 's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents . < br /><br />I've never really liked fairly odd parents , I mean , some things did make me laugh , but most of the time it 's downright annoying and not cute at all . This is almost the same way I feel about Johnny Test . Except , NOTHING makes me laugh on that show . The gags are so stupid and pointless , and to tell you the truth , maybe it 's just me , but kids do n't DRESS like that ! Yes , I do think Johnny 's hair is awesome , but c'Mon!<br /><br />And Dexter 's Lab , that used to be one of my favorite shows and I still do n't mind watching it . Which makes me disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Test making an absolute JOKE out of that wonderful show!<br /><br />One more thing . The . Dog . Is . So . Annoying . He is more loud and obnoxious than Johnny ! And the gay accent ? What the fudge ! I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies , because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show , and picking up a gay accent.<br /><br />Unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show , do n't watch it !
0 Cartoon Network seems to be desperate for ratings . Beginning with the cancellation of Samurai Jack , the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular , such as the Powerpuff Girls , Dexter 's Lab , Dragonball Z , etc . When the ratings started to plummet , CN began putting up some pretty mediocre shows . Though Total Drama Island / Action and Chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience - pleasing gimmicks , there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes ( George of the Jungle ) or rip offs of other shows , such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack , where the title character acts just like Spongebob , and then there 's Johnny Test , which is something of a replacement for Dexter 's Laboratory , though it 's much more of a sheer rip off than anything.<br /><br />The show 's characters are clearly derived from Dexter 's Lab , only this time the focus is on Johnny , a blonde ( or fiery - haired ) character who torments his twin sisters , Susan and Mary , who just HAPPEN to look just like Dexter , from the orange hair , to the glasses , the impossible technology . There is even a rival genius named Bling Bling Boy or Eugene , who appears to be sitting in for Mandark . Then there 's Dookie , Johnny 's best friend and talking dog , one of Dexter's ... I mean , Susan and Mary 's early experiments.<br /><br />Dexter 's Laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television , with its simple , but effective art style , lovable main character , and episodes that do n't seem to be a long drag . Johnny Test is a lot different . The art style here is n't nearly as eye - pleasing . In fact , it looks absolutely awful . The characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive . Like how most of the series ' episodes consist Johnny and Dookie 's quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl Sissy , whom Johnny secretly likes , or the twins ' obsession over a boy next door . Seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that Johnny appears to be someone you would NEVER want to associate with , there is no real connection between the viewer and characters.<br /><br />One thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that Johnny is Susan and Mary 's guinea pig for their experiments . These range from turning Johnny fat , ugly , monstrous , and even into a woman . The twins then help Johnny in whatever scheme he 's planning in return for his services . Whenever there 's an episode involving this kind of " win / win " deal , it usually comes undone at the seems and those that does n't come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly.<br /><br />The writing ranges from mediocre to horrid , however . The ' fat ' episode constantly repeats " It 's Phat with a PH . There 's a difference , you know . " which is a line that should never be repeated , especially when the episode seems to PROMOTE child obesity , with Johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat.<br /><br />Let 's talk about how the show does n't completely rip off Dexter 's Lab . The show tosses in a lot of characters , from two Men - in - Black named Mr. Black and Mr. White , a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through Johnny and his sisters , and LOTS of super villains , though even here , the show again steals ideas for other sources , like a Mr. Freeze teenage clone , an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man ( like the evil talking cat from Powerpuff Girls ) , a bumbling maniac mastermind , a trio of evil skater ' dudes ' and even a Mole Man , which is probably the most cliché villain in the media.<br /><br />To top it all off , alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters , the voice acting is either passable ( like the voices for Mr. Black and Mr. White ) to just plain ear - splitting ( Johnny , Dookie , and just about every villain in the show ) . The theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show , but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it.<br /><br />So in the end , Johnny Test is not a good cartoon . Its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little children 's interest in the show , while its bright coloring , ripped - off characters , and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens . It 's just another one of those crappy shows that Cartoon Network is over - promoting to trick people to watching it ( like MTV toward rap ) . If you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour , you 'd better stick to Spongebob , because Johnny Test is more of a " test " of patience than anything else .
0 Oh dear ! The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot " JOHNY TEST " while we were playing video games . I thought he was confusing " Johny Quest " ( by the way , one of the best cartoons I 've ever seen in my life " , and changing the " Quest " with " Test " . Its something weird that I 'm wrong , but actually I was wrong , he was n't changing nothing , he heard of this show.<br /><br />One day , while watching TV , I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released . I was n't sure of what was the plot of this show , so I adventured myself to watch it , and here is my answer " I WANT MY DAMN HOUR BACK " ( Because I watched this crap and " My Gym Partner 's a Monkey".<br /><br />This is one of the worst shows I 've ever seen . First , the beginning , with the most stupid song in the world , then the plot . Oh , where are my manners ? I have n't said the plot of this show . Is about a boy who has to AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters , that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother . OHHH , now I see why his name is Johny TEST , he is the test of his sisters experiments.<br /><br />You know , I honestly miss Dexter 's Lab ( before it was transformed to the NEW Dexter , a total crap too ) . This is a bad copy of that old good show , except that this show is amazingly bad . Do n't watch it , make something more productive in that half - hour than watch this crap .
0 OMG this was the most painful experience of my life watching this . I could even finish it what is happening to Nick . Their best thing on teen Nick is Drake and Josh and that s about to go off air . The kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids . My little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on Disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said " one of the worst shows that I have ever saw so boring . " My little brother actually fell asleep I envy him . In short if your 3yrs old with no brain activity you 'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now .
0 That 's right , you heard me this movie is a freaking ' ABOMINATION . First off , the band , who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called " THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND " ? ! ? ! Not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians , they ca n't even play anything ! Also , the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee , and even more his voice is horrible ! Not only are they terrible musicians but they 're terrible actors . Led by a crappy director and thin plot , this has got to be the dumbest movie ever . I wish this website would let you use a vote of ZERO OR BELOW out of 10 , because giving this filth a 1/10 is being WAY too generous.<br /><br />I'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film . If you 're looking for comedy with music , go to that " Weird Al " Yankovic guy 'cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens .
0 My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I got together with a bunch of my friends which are NBB haters and had a big bonfire and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing " Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead " . That was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol God this show sucks . I hate it so much . Get rid of the crappy car . You guys really suck ! You really ruined the whole channel ! No offence or anything but you guys need to get a life , I mean , really , who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that ca n't even sing ! You guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something , except Roselina . She 's really pretty . But still , you guys reak !
0 A very bad attempt at a young spinal tap . At least the music in spinal tap was good.<br /><br />This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at it 's worst . A bunch of Hollywood execs , bad musicians and producers create some " poopie " show so their kids can be in the spotlight . Oh please ! ! ! The potty humor was even bad . I hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids ( musicians , actors and artists ) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along.<br /><br />Help u all ! ! ! ! Why was n't Gene Simmons in it ? ? ? Ameriac 's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet .
0 " Show me your boobies ! " is not funny , and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I 'm coming from . I do n't want my 6 and 7 years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that . I find it sad that Nick hyped this crap THAT much and then that 's what we get , stupid little kids acting like stupid adults . I know it 's meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in K and 1st Grade who ca n't wait to see this . I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it . My daughters wo n't be watching it . I 'd love to block Nick but do n't have the heart at this point but if Nick keeps putting out this kind of crap I 'll have to .
0 I hate this movie . I hate the show . i hate just about everything about it . it 's so annoying and stupid . everyone 's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they 're going to make it big . WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like Jane Hudson from " Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? " . i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one , barely 30 seconds of the show , and i managed to survive about half an hour of ' Battle of the Bands ' . How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid 's Choice Awards , i have no clue . days before the movie premiere on Nick , most of the teen girl actresses on Nick ( Jamie Spears , Emma Roberts , Lindsey Shaw , etc . ) showed up in a commercial influencing brain - dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are . first off , they didn;t trick me , and second of all , nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing , because i do n't see how anyone could find this show / movie entertaining . the music is just awful . nat 's singing sounds like a sick , dying moose on crack . alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character EVER . he 's not funny , he 's annoying , he 's really weird , and he thinks he 's hot and knows everything about girls . this guy 's lucky if he ever manages to get laid . you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters ( in real life ) do n't even exist ! ! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex 's cousin jesse Draper ( they must ve had some budget problem ) . Their father is not single , he 's married to Polly Draper , but she does n't appear on the show , making it seem the Wolff 's are mom - less . Rosalina does n't exist either . Her name is Allie DiMeco . I 'll tell ya , the Naked Brothers are gon na be in some deep sh * * when their " fans " find out the whole thing is staged . 0/10
0 It 's terrible how some people can get away with such things ... This is one of those overrated things again ... And I hate things that are overrated that are no good ... Why ca n't we have more TV Shows and Movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something ? ? It takes many people to make this movie , the series , and the band , all possible , and those people are all wasting their time ... It seems that the bands are getting younger and younger ... I looked at how small that they were , and I thought that they were 5 or 6 . It 's sad that kids are performing that young ... They are still too young ... Performing takes a lot of work , and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives ... The idea about having a very young band is horrible ... They need to stop having bands like this ... And I do n't like the idea at all , nor the kids themselves ... They are very annoying , very young , and their name is " The Naked Brothers Band " The people that are involved in this , and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds ... Whenever this band is shown on TV , change the channel , and petition to get it banned ... <br /><br />And I know that this is a very boring comment thing , but you get the point ... <br /><br />This Band Sucks ... Get Rid Of It ...
0 I totally hated the movie . It was so retarded . They need to get some acting lessons .... no , wait , that wo n't help because the Naked Brothers Band people a retards . You know why I am here even though I am a Naked Brothers Band hater ? To warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the NBB does n't get any money from it so then they ca n't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds . Not only are the song lyrics retarded , they sing badly . Okay , I 'm kinda getting off the movie here ..... anyways , it was boring and they acted horribly . It was NOT funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be . I guess they deserve some credit for that ... well , the movie is n't worth your time . Just look at its rating . The movie ( and the series ) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain . Seriously , if you liked it , you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act , not babbling their lines in a monotone . I am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alex guys . Hurry before it 's too late ! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie . I do n't even know why I went through even HALF of that film . I do n't think it even deserves to be called a film ...
0 wow , the Naked Brothers Band . What should i say . I guess i can say this show just sucks . number one : they have no talent , they probably ca n't even play the instruments . number 2 : on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on . Look , i really do n't hate it that bad , i 'd give it like a 4 out of 10 , but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and Nat is SO deep and writes deep lyrics . Deep my ass ! he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings . wow , i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that . And they did n't get famous by themselves , their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show . i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon .
0 I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car ? So what if their ten , It 's way too immature for a little kid to sing about " being my women " I mean seriously ! The name is pretty corny too , naked brothers ? just because they take off their pants ? ? ? HOW CREATIVE.I do n't get why they need a TV show I mean most artist do n't really need a TV show about themselves , especially the naked brothers band . Heck how many of them are in the freaking group . And seriously what s with the movie ? Jeez Nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously The naked brother band ? SO many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the Naked Brother 's band , its a stupid , uncreative show that should not be aired onto TV .
0 Okay I saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie . First off the movie is so posed and not real , they are all acting . They ca n't sing . They are way too full of themselves . Its awful . Yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid . I mean they say their manager is a kid . And there record label is fake . Its stupid . Do n't see it.<br /><br />As for the set up and directing , not so bad . It is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing . < br /><br />Only see this if you do n't really like good music . Also , it 's very corny . It 's not even tasteful . I hate to be so mean ... but this really is a piece of junk .
0 I know the people and I did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible ! They are rich little kids who do n't have any talent , and probably just begged Nick to accept them ! Alex has played the drums for one yearm , I 've played for 4 1/2 ! The movie is terrible and so is the show ! This is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny I 've ever seen . It is so stupid it makes me want to barf ! ! ! It is just so crazy that Nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb ! They are sooo stupid and weird ! I hate them and their show and think once Nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off !
0 I have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny , but it 's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.<br /><br />Its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine , and try to get the respect they deserve.<br /><br />The acting is really good . Dabney Coleman is one of those 80 's stars that plays a good bad guy , not really evil , just unlikeable . Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here . Jane Fonda is so - so and does little for me . Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie , she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times , got ta love her.<br /><br />I could recommend this to anyone that likes 80 's comedy . I like the movie but it has things about it that I do n't like . It starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters . They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although ' cute ' I just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie . As the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down , only to wrap up in a quick manner that s too good to be true.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars , but give it a try if you have n't seen it . I think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable .
0 I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin , TX . However , I was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended . Big Rig is comprised of several " big rig " drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the United States . The characters are all wonderful people , however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people . Instead , the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide , but never do . At most , we get lost . We - the audience - end up going nowhere and , like the direction of the storytelling , end up somewhere but without direction , location , or plot . Why are we here ? Where are we ? How did we get here ? The storytelling is sloppy and the directors ' intent on " humanizing " a group of people who they regard as " overlooked " and " invisible " comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending . The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers . The directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions . Overall , the story lacks any tension , the film is entirely too long ( should have been a 15 min sketch ) , the big question of " So what " is never answered , and the entire film is one piece of see - through propaganda that does nothing to further " enlighten " ( as the directors claim ) the outside world about big riggers .
0 This is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most . Great cast , great director , great story potential , then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhere ... and says nothing while going there ! There is no depth here whatsoever . No depth of characters , no depth of plot , no depth of surprise , suspense , or common sense . We know what 's happening , we are told how they plan to fix the problem , they fix the problem , throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense , then they end the film abruptly . Wasted opportunity.<br /><br />On the plus side , Glenn Ford leads a cast of UK ( and one French ) actors who are all fantastic , doing an incredibly impressive job with the one - dimensional writing they were given . One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as " Old Charlie " , who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film . I also thought the film had a great look to it ... all shadows and fog ... very film noir in feel.<br /><br />Even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable , it still just is n't enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film . There are far better Glenn Ford movies out there : The Big Heat , Gilda , Affair in Trinidad , etc .
0 When I first saw this movie , it was titled TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of a double feature . Glenn Ford , an armament expert is called on to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives . The tension is slow and steady ; and this black & white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes . All these years later on TV ; the tension and drama has lost most of its impact . This is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go.<br /><br />Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham . The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern .
0 A real blow - up of the film literally . This British film is boringly made.<br /><br />What an exciting plot ! A terrorist places bombs on a train . How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story?<br /><br />Glenn Ford , as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb , is given awful writing material to work with . Naturally , just as he is called in , his wife , Anne Vernon , is about to leave him . No wonder we never heard of Miss Vernon . After such a film , it would be enough to end her career.<br /><br />That elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia . I thought it was highly insulting to show this man , even at the end .
0 This British film is truly awful , and it 's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it , although he pretty much sleepwalks through it . The idea of a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film ! No action , no movement , just a static train . The area where the train is parked is evacuated , so it 's not like there 's any danger to anyone either . In fact , this film could be used in a film class to show how NOT to make a suspense film . True suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters do n't , a fact apparently unknown to the director . SPOILER : the train actually has two bombs on it , but we are led to believe there is only one . After the first bomb is defused , it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more . But at the last minute , the villain , who has no apparent motivation for his actions , reveals there are two . Nor are we certain WHEN the bombs will go off , so we do n't even have a classic " ticking bomb " tension sequence . A good 10 minutes or more are spent watching Glenn Ford 's French wife thinking about leaving him , and then wondering where he is . She 's such an annoying character that we do n't care whether she reconciles with him , so when she does , there 's nothing emotional about it . Most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality , and none have any problems or issues . It 's only 72 minutes , but it feels long because it 's tedious and dull . Do n't waste your time .
0 Truly awful film made by cinematographer - turned - director Ted Tetzlaff . Decent enough looking film but for a time - bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever . Ford , as someone put it here , sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk . There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex - army or RAF , defused bombs in the war , his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much . The bomber himself is a complete mystery . Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines ? For that matter , what time period are we talking about here ? WWII or postwar ? ? I assumed the latter which makes bomber 's motive even more salient . Generally , though , just a horrible film . There are plenty of good time - bomb flicks to skip this one . Watch any episode of " Danger UXB " for a more exciting time , at about the same running time .
0 Letting the class watch this in English was a bad idea . Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect , but it appears this one did n't have any effect whatsoever on the class - whenever the teacher left , conversations quickly started - and I did n't hear the words " Shakespeare " or " Tempest " being used at all . And when you look at this , it is easy to see why . The acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to bits , just reading from the page without a care in the world . Shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death , but I just could n't understand a word anyone was saying . The costumes are n't too bad and neither are the special effects - the class may not have loved the film , but they were n't exactly taking the p*ss either . But it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy . The scenes on the ship at the start of the film were n't too badly done - though the rain looked a bit unrealistic , everything else was done well and good . But where were the severed heads and exploding masts ? Where was the death ? Where was the inspiration ? The character of Ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes - but as all was on show , he was just another excuse for a joke . This film is not in any way appealing to either sex . The women and girls wo n't have any romance or comedy to enjoy , and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off . The Tempest was n't badly done , but this felt like something the producers HAD to make , not something they wanted to make . And the general boredom and lack of inspiration show . 3/10
0 SPOILERS ( ALTHOUGH NONE THAT AREN'T REVEALED IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE MOVIE)<br /><br />Robin Williams is actually quite good in this as the friendly , lonely , emotionally stunted loser Sy . He makes a very human , even sympathetic psycho , and really disappears into the character -- no small feat for such a recognizable performer . < br /><br />Too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste . The supporting performances ( and performers ) would n't look out of place in a soft - core porno ( it does n't help that every character but Sy is made of 100 % cardboard ) . At times , the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense : we know from the very first moments a ) that Sy is a complete whack - job , b ) that he survives , and c ) that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end . So all we 're left to ponder is the how s and the why s , and the answers provided are n't all that interesting.<br /><br />The plot is plodding and contrived , and features some nonsensical moments ( for instance , the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes , even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore ) . About two thirds of the way through , Sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme . And the final clichéd explanation of his psychosis , right out of ` Peeping Tom , ' is a terrible copout.<br /><br />The dialogue is of the absolute worst sort . It 's not overwritten , or awkward , or unbelievable , or bad in any other way that could be considered fun , even for bad - movie lovers . Instead , every line is purely , hideously functional -- it 's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said , ` Hey , I need a workable script on this -- in an hour . ' It made me want to scream , honestly.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware - the - help thrillers of the eighties and nineties ( ` The Hand That Rocks the Cradle , ' e.g. ) , and while it 's certainly unpleasant , it 's never really scary . Sy 's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable , but on its own that 's not enough to make the film work . In the end , lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved , except Robin Williams , sinks this one . 3 out of 10 .
0 There were good performances by Robin Williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews.<br /><br />I thought Sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death : a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts , quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot them.<br /><br />I think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos . I expect most retail workers want a break from the customers .
0 Up until the last few minutes of the movie , I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars . However , the ending is so terrible and " Hollywoodized " that it completely undermines the first 80 % of the movie.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles . The Captain , Gene Hackman , is all for launching , while his first officer , Denzel Washington , is in favor of confirming the launch orders first . The problem is , to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys . Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub . Eventually , the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched . Cool . However , here comes the part that just does n't ring true . After they are back on land and go before a review board , Washington and Hackman ( who 'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other ) shake hands and are all buddy buddy ! Huh ? ! Too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me .
0 This movie is an insult to ALL submariners . It was stupid . It appeared to have been written by monkeys . The acting was absurd . If this is the view most people have of the Navy , then I weep for our defense . This movie was awful . I put it below " Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea " as far as submarine movies go . Gene Hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap . Denzel Washington must have been high . Little in the plot makes any sense . And the ending . For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime ? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage . If you have n't figured it out yet , I did n't like it . And if it was n't for all the pro comments , I would not have bothered to post .
0 As a former submariner , this was one of the worst submarine movies I have ever seen . First of all , a mutiny aboard any US Naval vessel , particularly a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable . These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission . The responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the most junior crew member . I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer . An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington did would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed , then drummed from the Navy . It is no surprise the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film . Lastly , if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded . Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection . They do n't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway . I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway . Loud music would never be tolerated . I know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets , but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous . I would not recommend this movie to anyone .
0 Yep , lots of shouting , screaming , cheering , arguing , celebrating , fist clinching , high fiving & fighting . You have a general idea as to why , but can never be 100 % certain . A naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points , but then you 'd probably spot the many flaws . Not an awful film & Hackman & Washington are their usual brilliant , but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on . I 'm still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other & do n't argue , but then you probably would n't have a film.<br /><br />4/10
0 We laughed our heads off . This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep.<br /><br />My dad was a sea captain for 30 years , he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie.<br /><br />During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship , the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and ( sorry ) s**t on his desk . Of course this was not on a nuclear mission.<br /><br />For instance , the fire in the kitchen , fire is the most important thing on any ship , nuclear or not . To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script . When a captain is put under arrest , he IS under arrest , you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept . This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room . He CANNOT escape , it 's just like in prison.<br /><br />Funny thing is , my dad also had a dog on board , however , we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room . This is not done , ever . My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.<br /><br />Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for , all the rest is bulls**t.<br /><br />When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk , this film gets an extra dimension.<br /><br />If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent : Thas Boat.<br /><br / >
0 If asked how I would define the word " Shallow " I would reply " Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production " . If asked how I would define the phrase " Wasted potential " I would reply " Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production " . Bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . Off the top of my head I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting a lot of critical acclaim . < br /><br />CRIMSON TIDE too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . The problem I had is the scenario that sets up the story : The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of Russia leading to an ultra nationalist Russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere . Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing . It`s not helped by some errors in geography like the French carrier Foch being in the Med ( Wouldn`t the Foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans , the first gulf war and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective " Very unconvincing " crept into my mind . The story does improve somewhat when the story proper - A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . Director Tony Scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . The worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means CRIMSON TIDE has little impact .
0 What an appalling film . Do n't get me wrong , Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors , but aside from a few interesting set pieces , the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting , crying , sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong.<br /><br />Take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what 's going on ( the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke ) and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting.<br /><br />Let us just hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a script!<br /><br / >
0 This movie had some andrenaline kickers , but it 's an old story that simply could never happen . Navy protocols could never break down that much that a crew much less an XO could ever go that far against the Captain . I 'll take Dr. Strangelove any day if I wish to see this plot . Sidenote -- the US Navy did not support this film .
0 What a load of Leftist Hollywood bilge . This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles . The fairytale ends with the pacifist character , played by Danzel Washington , actually getting promoted for his treason . What is it with these Hollywood tools ? Is this still payback for McCarthyism?<br /><br />If I sound cynical it 's because I am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda . The military brass in this movie are portrayed as , what else ? Gung - ho war mongers . Sound familiar ? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil ? Think about it . Yet again , Crimson Tide stresses the point . The Hackman character , U - boat captain Ramsey , comes across like a raving lunatic , until the very end when , of course he comes to his senses , does a complete 360 , renounces his blood lust , suggests a promotion for the treasonous Ron Hunter , and repents by retiring from the service . A guy mutinies , takes command of your boat , puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first - strike , and you promote him ? ? ? ? What hogwash !
0 Edwin Porter 's 1903 short film entitled " The Great Train Robbery " bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film . Just like Melies ' " A Trip to the Moon " , critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema . In my eyes , they were right . It had everything from the planning , the actual heist of the train , the murder of an unwanted civilian , and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time . From here to Eastwood , every western filmmaker has used Porter 's image in some form or another to create their own story . One can not say that this film did n't open the door , but the struggle comes from the story itself . The genre was defined by Porter , but outside of its initial excitement  there really is n't anything to grapple onto . Perhaps I am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their haphazard messages , but how can something be cliché before being cliché ? To me , " The Great Train Robbery " seemed forced , untraceable , and unsurprising.<br /><br />Unlike Melies , Porter tells a very linear story . Robbers change the course of a train , rob it , then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains , and the final scene ends like any predestined film , without any surprises or glitches , and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face . It is bland . Porter 's film is boring . In the edition I watched , there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion , which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker , or to the viewer . The issue remains that while it is important , Porter 's film has been borrowed time and time again , it has in effect become diluted . The story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has . Unlike Melies early film , I can not watch this again . I know what has happened , I know there is very little missing from behind the scenes , and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point A to point B to point C. This issue is not only my gripe with this film , but also the strongest element to see in such an early film . While it was dull , the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives , was outstanding to see . In an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream , this broke the mold . Again , not that I am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film  it is an important film  it just is n't a great film.<br /><br />Overall , I was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted , but I was equally as happy to leave this film behind . Porter is a talented director , and G.M. Anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field , but I just was n't in awe of the film . I was n't expecting big budget effects like Melies work , nor was I expecting a duplicate of " A Trip to the Moon " , but I did want to see the same creativity , exploration , and originality . I felt Porter played it safe , if that can be said with such an early film , but I could n't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds . I was n't rooting for anyone , and the final conclusion proved that the kitschy - ness of it had worn off minutes after the film started . It was pioneering , but not monumental . " The Great Train Robbery " has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema.<br /><br />Grade : * * out of * * * * *
0 " Washington Square " is a flat , shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James . Indeed , the novel is very good , but far from the level of James ' masterpieces . Moreover its simple , eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film ( although William Wyler , with his " The Heiress " , gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel ) . < br /><br />Anyway , the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great American writer . In the novel , the heroine Catherine is shy , not very attractive and somewhat clumsy , but nonetheless she is a sound , intelligent young woman , and she 's not as naive as it may seem . Her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful , with no morbid sides in it . Along three quarters of the movie , Catherine ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) just seems to be mentally retarded , poor thing . In the last quarter , she suddenly ( and incredibly ) becomes intelligent , aware of her dignity as a woman , and all that.<br /><br />The director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story . The first , when the nervous child Catherine has , well , troubles with her vesica . The second scene , when we see on the background a sort of open - air brothel , with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents , and so on . Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James . It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the Victorian age . I defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James ' huge literary production . I really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes.<br /><br />Yes , I know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel . But if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author ( here Henry James ) , I do n't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie . < br /><br />The acting is adequate to the movie : poor and flat , in spite of the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith . " Washington Square " is definitely a non - recommendable film .
0 I do not know who is to blame , Miss Leigh or her director , but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch . Ben Chaplin on the other hand does a superior job - against all odds as far as I am concerned . His character is entirely too charming and appealing . but certainly not shown as greedy enough , to put up with Leigh 's character 's silliness . Chaplin appears bemused by what can not possibly be understood as Leigh 's shyness and lack of grace , but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness . There has to be some element of believability to his interest , but as played it is incomprehensible . The performances do not jibe . Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are , of course , wonderful despite any effort to derail them . The supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch . What a pity , too , the leads do n't work together because the production is lovely to look at .
0 I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception . I was very excited to see a new movie coming out , based on the book of that title . Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles . Albert Finney is miscast and does n't carry the role well . I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith .... or rather her silly , insipid role . The real problem and what 's lacking in this latest version is a good script , music , and direction.<br /><br />I fell asleep in the theater watching this long , drawn out and exceptionally boring movie . There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play . In the book I felt a deep caring for Catherine Sloper and her life . The movie had just the opposite effect . I also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris . Eeeeeeeek . YUK.<br /><br />Watch it if you ca n't sleep , it 's a definite snoozer . Do n't watch it if you 're depressed . You 'll need Zoloft after this.<br /><br />Sure , " The Heiress " was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles . The actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring , cold father .... still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it . The movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one.<br /><br />This movie was a box office flop . I have no doubts as to why .
0 This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father . The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland 's far more nuanced , mature rendering in The Heiress ( 1949 ) . The film 's feminist - leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel , Washington Square , whose author , Henry James , savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels . As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature , I found this movie very disappointing .
0 I understand there was some conflict between Leigh and the great Maggie Smith during the filming . Understandable when you put one of the world 's greatest actresses of all time ( Smith , of course ) with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent film .
0 This adaptation , like 1949 's * The Heiress * , is based on the Henry James novel . * The Heiress * , starring Olivia de Havilland , remains as a well - respected piece of work , though less true to James ' original story than this new remake , which retains James ' original title . It is the story of a awkward , yet loving daughter ( Leigh ) , devoted to her father ( Finney ) after her mother dies during childbirth . The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever , and considers her , as well as all women , simpleminded . When a young man ( Chaplin ) of good family and little fortune comes courting , the Father is naturally suspicious , but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man , is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him . Leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style , like she 's acting through gritted teeth . She 's not bad in this , and she handles her role relatively deftly  it 's just an awkward role for any actress , making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses . While the character garners a lot of sympathy , she 's not particularly likable . The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin ( previously seen in * The Truth About Cats and Dogs * ) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune , or is really in love with her . Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well - meaning aunt . Finney is marvelous , of course , as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience , but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves . But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune ? This is only one instance where * Washington Square * differs from * The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it . It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet , offering too little story in too long of a movie .
0 It 's interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films . While The Heiress was a good , if not entirely accurate , adaptation , Washington Square is a heavy - handed and poorly acted , except for the part of Dr Sloper , film that could have been so much better.<br /><br />The director 's attempts at making ' beautiful ' scenes were so obvious that I actually cringed . It has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have , such as Onegin . I agree with other comments about Leigh 's portrayal of Catherine as an idiot , instead of naive and shy ; she made me despise her not feel for her.<br /><br />Catherine 's transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism , the whole point of the story , was internalised , just as it was in the novel . But we do n't have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film ! I think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool.<br /><br />I appreciate the director 's attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just did n't work .
0 The potential movie extravaganza , set during the 19th century , failed to produce . With big - name actors like Maggie Smith , Albert Finney , and many others , there was no reason for the movie to fail . However , the movie lacked an ending , had a sorry excuse for a plot line , and fell to pieces with its continuity . A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy , brought together by love and destroyed by beauty ( or lack thereof ) and disapproval , has a touching side of a mother 's early death and an absentee father . The father , played by Finney , is a disturbed man , tormenting his daughter in life as well as death . He believes his daughter 's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status . The actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline . Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction , wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch . I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 , purely for the actors ' attempts . Save yourself , stay clear of Washington Square .
0 Visually cluttered , plot less , incredibly mind - numbing rubbish . Not even close to Greenaway 's better work . Avoid at all costs!<br /><br />The overlapping ' split screen ' effects do nothing more than confuse , the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the ' artistic ' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film ; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic , which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring.<br /><br />Plus , how anyone can say that the acting of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me . He showed more ability in the Star Wars series , and that 's saying something.<br /><br />I've not been so unimpressed with a film since I saw ' Darby O'Gill and the Little People ' !
0 This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin.<br /><br />The plot is absolutely bizarre . I fail to see any " sensual " or " erotic " undertones . The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography . In addition , the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong , such as the airport in the middle of the city , poor living conditions and noise pollution . Throughout the whole film , I keep thinking that " The Pillow Book " is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment.<br /><br />"The Pillow Book " is a perverted , yet boring film . Seriously stay away from it .
0 I really wanted to like The Pillow Book . Intriguing story , interesting character outlines , Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether . Unfortunately , I hated every minute of it . Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely , and not to the film 's benefit . I wo n't even get into Vivian Wu 's abysmal acting.<br /><br />You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that 's playing . It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot , and got entangled with foo - foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything . It 's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says " GRANDMA LOVES ME ! " in big sparkly letters.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur 's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful . In another director 's hands ( Jeunet ? Coppola ? ) , it could have been a masterpiece . In Greenaway 's hands , it 's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously .
0 I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of Greenaways output . However it was his usual mix of " art " sex and pretentious crap . I know lots of people like this film but I grew tired of it VERY quickly . It is definitely not for everyone . The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part for crediblity 's sake I guess but he really should not have wasted his time . I hate to consign anyone to pseud 's corner but please ..... ! ! ! On the plus side it IS visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and I can not say that for many movies . I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable ! !
0 This movie was just down right bad . I love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that I liked , but this was not one of them . This movie lacked substance and intensity . OK I get it , the Finns put up one hell of a fight and that s great , but the story is poorly told . You do n't have any real connection with any of the characters and there 's no real story line to follow . You just go from one random scene to another , nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed . If you want a war movie that will keep you riveted , and amazingly enough without battles scenes , then I would suggest " Downfall " ( WWII German film ) . Or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then I would suggest " Brotherhood of War " ( Korean war / Korean film ) . These two movies will not let you down as Winter War will .
0 The writers probably had no experience in the army , and probably never glanced at a history book , but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long - needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is confused and unbelievable -- any episode of Combat ! has better production values , but the cast is interesting . Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this . The art direction is fifth rate -- the men wear Korean War uniforms , and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944 , not sunny as they show here , and I do n't think the terrain resembled Northern California . The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers . There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s , which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops ) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then , and its not too late to try it now . You have to take this for what it is , and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy , which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944 .
0 This movie has Richard Pryor , Rosey Grier and others . It 's a curious WW2 movie , and serves as a statement about racism . It is worth watching to understand the fact that Movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray . Meaning this is a 70 's movie not a 40 's movie ( WW2 ) . Still , there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a Dam . The story centers on the Captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company . There is a scene that could be from a Civil War movie and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about . The Black Lt . gives a German women a innocent peck on the cheek , and the white Capt becomes upset . I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the Genre were interesting to me .
0 At first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick , and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction . However , the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected , and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the World War II era Army . The recognizable cast is hit and miss , with Glynn Turman , Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best . Stephen Boyd , however , stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.<br /><br />The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values . The locations are great , the effects and action are weak . Imagine if " Saving Private Ryan " had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way Vin Diesel 's Caparzo had ( except we do get to see the shot because they effects ca n't handle it ) , then Hanks , Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax . Yet , the denouement , with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black , and Boyd 's racist Captain being effected by this , is compelling , as are the sequences of of Turman 's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.<br /><br />In short , " Black Brigade / Carter 's Army " does n't quite succeed . But it 's a respectable failure , not a bad joke . It could be remade as a very good film , and , as it stands , is an interesting effort .
0 This movie is a waste of film stock . Do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see ? It happened in this film . Do you believe that a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in Europe during WWII to serve in a " Negro " unit ... cooking , supply services , burial detail , etc . ? It happened in this film . Do you believe that a black ( and supposedly intelligent ) officer would select this same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived ? It happened in this film . Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did n't realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him ? It happened in this film . Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers hold - up in a barn at a farmhouse that the Germans happened upon would SHOUT out their emotions at the sight of the German soldiers who were just 50 ' away ? They did it in this film , and left any possible entrances to the barn the Germans might check totally unprotected . Would you believe that , over the airwaves and in clear English , the Captain mentioned the General 's rank , if not his name , as the person he was speaking with and that the general , in plain English over open airwaves , said that the dam had to be protected the next day ? Maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the American attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the Germans . This so - called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films . If it were , I 'm sure it would do well . Watch it at your own risk .
0 BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic , which was based on Noel Coward 's play " Still Life " . A doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman 's eye at a railway station , he is in a miserable relationship , she is happily married social worker of Italian ancestry . They meet by accident on another occasion , form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday . The pair fall in love , but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part . Coward 's original one - act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love . Sophia Loren and Richard Burton , two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics , are nobody 's idea of ' ordinary people ' . Loren in particular is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make - up , looking like a million dollars , working as a part - time voluntary social worker at a Citizen Advice Bureau just does n't ring true . Burton , looking haggard , with dyed hair , too much make - up and wearing platform shoes , does n't come across as your average General Practitioner . That said , you ca n't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses . Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt . Loren 's husband , Jack Hedley , potters around the house all day and is terminally boring : the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous . Their final scene together will induce nausea , ( " You 've been a long , long way away " , etc . ) . That great British jobbing actor , John LeMesurier , has a three minute cameo as Burton 's friend , and appears to be slightly inebriated , speaking his lines in a barely audible voice . It 's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal , awful rehash of a cinema classic . Avoid at all costs .
0 Remakes ( and sequels ) have been a staple of Cinema from the beginning of the media . It is pretty much a hit or miss venture though . If you take what 's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards , you can have a success . Note , such films like THE THIEF OF BAGDAD ( 1924/1940 ) or KING KONG ( 1933/2005 ) succeeded in their attempts . Others like KING KONG ( 1976 ) fail , miserably.<br /><br />BRIEF ENCOUNTER ( 1945 ) is the template for this film . It is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it IMDb**********Ten . The story is simple , Love , innocently found by accident and tragically lost . Why , it just happened for the two ( 2 ) principals involved at the wrong time . These are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON . Neither are conventionally leading Star material , but quality Character Actors . For the details watch the film.<br /><br />Now what went wrong ? A T.V. Movie , remade practically scene for scene with name actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least scored IMDb******Six . Both actors though appear disinterested , just showing up to punch their time - clocks and pick up their checks . Neither are involved with their characters or with each other . You do not believe they are in Love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them . That should not be and that 's why it fails in its intent . Sometimes it is just better to leave things alone .
0 Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old , celebrated English film . Although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster ( which it is not ) , it never builds any tension and betrays its TV origins . Richard Burton sleepwalks through his role , and Sophia Loren 's closed ( in this movie ) face does n't display much passion , either . ( * * )
0 I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt . The opening moments , with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter , Diana , about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art , give the impression that this could be a kick - ass artsy - vampire flick . Turns out this initial impression turns out false . Oh , Troma , the mark of some kind of lack of quality : sometimes they 'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk - food craft ( or , sometimes not ) . This is a case where it 's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor ( i.e. the protagonist 's father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante impressions ? ) are weak at best , and any unintentional laughs are undercut by Sergio Lapel 's bargain basement direction.<br /><br />And it 's not without him trying , oh Lord no . He does try a lot , which is a big part of the problem . He and his producers had money for lights , sure , but the way they 're used in the movie made I , a former student filmmaker and aspiring director , sulking in my seat : if I saw this in a theater I would have to blind my eyes in many instances , and would wonder whether or not his DP understood really the basic 3-point lighting set - up . While this , along with a very lackluster sound design ( or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene ) , should n't be something that comes to attention during a Troma release , it should be something * basic * that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script is n't very funny or scary ( and it is n't ) or if Lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.<br /><br />It 's not a good movie by any stretch , and perhaps if you 're a vampire die - hard ( or just a vampire period ) it might have some appeal as a low - rent bargain basement alternative to Near Dark , or as a slight improvement over , say , 1972 's Blood Freak . You have better ways to waste your time , overall .
0 A female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood . She has an assistant who does n't want to be a vampire , so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker . After a few kills , the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie ? That its pacing is over - slow , that it has some strange sound effects ( never a bite sounded so strange ) and ambiance ( new jazz here I come ) and that lights do n't seem to be included on the set . It looks like an " auteur " horror movie with all the self - sufficiency inside.<br /><br />The plot is completely stupid and as you can guess , it 's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she does n't have to do it ; of course , crosses , light , garlic and sticks do n't work.<br /><br />It 's not even a funny lousy movie . Perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers , it ca n't have its funny sides ( to be honest , it 's funny during 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie ) . Do n't be fooled by the Troma sticker , it 's one the bad movie they present .
0 A vampire 's 's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five - dollar hooker in this extremely low - budget horror - comedy . I ca n't explain all the positive comments on this movie . I 'll chalk it up to mass hallucination , but it 's disconcerting none the less . The one redeeming factor ( and this is me being extremely generous here ) might be the Grandfather who 's the only semi - likable character in this whole mess . Do n't waste your money , or time . In fact here 's a word of advice , If Troma puts it out on DVD , but does NOT make it themselves , in all likelihood it 's crap.<br /><br />Troma DVD Extras : Commentary with Omar and Kirk ; second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes ; bloopers ; troma interactivity ; radiation march ; Clip from " Terror Firmer " ; Theatrical trailer ; Trailers for " the Rowdy Girls " , " Teenage Catgirls in Heat " , " Cannible : The Musical " , and " Toxic Avenger 4 " < br /><br />My Grade : D
0 This was a painful example of a cheap , boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian TV stations to fulfil local content quotas . The writing was truly terrible and I 'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memory the Honerable Wally Norman.<br /><br />Nothing about this TV series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing . It was just tired and BAD and , worst of all , it really thought it was funny . It was simply embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />There is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb . Try to find a ( real ) review by a ( real ) Australian viewer of the show ( there were n't many ) and it is impossible . Or crazy . There are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show . < br /><br />Avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on DVD , remember that the laughter THAT deserves was unintentional .
0 Of course , " Flatley " is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer , but I think Michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title : " Feet of Flames " < br /><br />One really ca n't resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray to the retiring ( and clearly , ailing ) Flatley.<br /><br />I might add that , much like that cheering London crowd ( per review below ) , I too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance.<br /><br />"Hinting that it may be his last live performance , Flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic London crowd .

0 With a cast of stalwart British character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s Britain , I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film . Unfortunately I found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - I could n't quite believe how awful it was . I must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time , but this was really hard going.<br /><br />As others have noted , a major problem is that it does n't seem to know what it wants to be : a gentle romantic comedy , a slapstick comedy or a musical . I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in ! It 's not believable on any level , either the storyline itself or the fact that Daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time . Other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter ( a songwriter for God 's sake ! ) , the fact he has Diana Dors for a fiancée and does n't appear to have the slightest interest in her ( I mean , Diana Dors ! Come on ! ) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher 's office . The whole thing 's silly in the worst possible way.<br /><br />If I had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way .
0 A 1957 ( yes , that 's the correct date ) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice , Margaret Rutherford , Wilfred Hyde White ; it has to be a smash comedy , right ? Oh , it 's just awful . It 's a one gag film : watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator . Music is thrown in , most inappropriately and forgettably . Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer . But what was she doing in this film ? Diana Dors is here too , providing oh - so - daring shots for use in the previews . Her acting level is not bad , but she 's in the film to provide someone to leer at . Well , one must do something beside groan during this film . The movie is being sold on VHS now by people on e - Bay . Spare yourself the expense and the waste of time . A comedy without a laugh . A musical without a memorable song or dance .
0 This is a bad B movie masquerading as a mockumentary . The porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character . That completely destroyed any " documentary feel " that they may have wanted to create.<br /><br />The fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of it 's problems . The film is not funny . The film is not sexy . The film does n't have anything insightful to say about the porn business . It 's not even particularly salacious . While there 's simulated sex , the amount of nudity is mild for an R rated film.<br /><br />Someday , someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry . This is not it .
0 Half the reviews were good so i took a chance for $ 10 . Sure Priscilla Barnes had some sex talk but it was n't much . The whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother & the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it . Its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time . Boogie Nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry . It could have shocked with what s popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger & better decades ago in the early 1970s .
0 Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal , you saw in - jokes all over the place . If you know anything about porn , this mock documentary will leave you cold . Everything in it rings false.<br /><br />Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top . This film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world.<br /><br />The acting here is uniformly awful , but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good . But it 's not .
0 Belmondo is a tough cop . He goes after a big - time drug dealer ( played by Henry Silva , normally a great villain - see " Sharky 's Machine " ; but here he is clearly dubbed , and because of that he lacks his usual charisma ) . He goes to the scuzziest places of Paris and Marseilles , asks for some names , beats up some people , gets the names , goes to more scuzzy places , asks for more names , beats up more people , etc . The whole movie is punch after punch after punch . It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of " Dirty Harry " . Belmondo , who was 50 here , does perform some good stunts at the beginning ; apart from those , " Le Marginal " is a violent , episodic , trite , shallow and forgettable cop movie . ( * 1/2 )
0 This film is terrible . The story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister . The film struggles with its identity , lurching from Noir / thriller to erotic , with elements of horror thrown in for good measure . The film has a very confused structure , for example with frequent use of flashbacks without tying these into the story . The plot is poorly developed , and the characterisation made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they were playing . Some implausibilities exist in many films , but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home , then agrees to go upstairs alone ( to where he says she will find a phone ) , minus the gun she had brought with her , to call the Police , was too hard to believe . Some of the cinematography is very poor : we were watching on a 42 " TV so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me . Overall , a chaotic mess .
0 I rented this movie on DVD . I knew that the movie would n't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case , but once I saw that Leatherface ( Gunnar Hansen ) was in it , I had to rent it . It starts off pretty good , with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable . However , the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever , and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging . There are way too many unanswered questions . There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise , but overall this is a very sub par movie , but I guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee .
0 I saw " Rachel 's Attic , " thinking that I would be in for an enjoyably visceral , ride . However , it was not to be the case . Visceral , yes , but enjoyable ? That would be a big , fat , no ! In fact , the only reason that I gave it a " 3 , " is due to the fact that Gunnar Hansen appears ( ever so briefly ) as one of the film 's reprehensible characters . How they ever lured Mr. Hansen into this piece of ... work , I 'll never know . The story idea is interesting but poorly executed . The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre . The only thing that is worse than that , are the special effects . YIKES ! ! ! I 've seen better effects in a grade school play . Give it up , Mr. W , it 's time for a career change ... I hear they 're hiring at Mel 's Diner ! There are very few , well made , Inde movies coming out of Michigan ... and " Rachel 's Attic " is n't one of them .
0 I sometimes enjoy really lousy movies .... those that occasionally result when people ( even talented people ) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster . Movies like " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " , " Plan 9 from Outer Space " , " Manos - Hands of Fate " , and " Heavens Gate " , etc.<br /><br />So , when I heard that this movie , " Rachel 's Attic " , was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade , naturally I just HAD to see it.<br /><br />Boy , do I regret that decision . This movie is beyond bad .... it is SO bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie . The acting , filming , script , etc . are even worse than a low budget porno film : the sound is utterly horrible , the " plot " is completely incomprehensible , the " acting " is laughable .... it is a complete waste of everyone 's time and money . At least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony , while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple , and a " mad hatter 's " tea party.<br /><br />The lighting is non - existent ... many " scenes " take place in semi or complete darkness , which is probably just as well . The " writer - director " ( I use the terms loosely ) , David Tybor , tries to get kinky with bondage scenes ... but the results would be laughable , if they were n't so pathetic . There is some nudity , but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant . I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film.<br /><br />For the love of god , avoid this train wreck . I know that despite ( or perhaps because of ) my negative comments , you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as I claim it to be .... but trust me on this .... it 's even worse than I have said , and you will absolutely , positively regret the experience ( and expense , if you waste your money on a purchase or rental ) .
0 Hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest , though the audience sees he is a werewolf . The hunters never seem to realize this , because after they shoot him , he looks normal when they decapitate him.<br /><br />A doctor transplants the werewolf 's eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment . The man , Rich , gets to have sex with his nurse ( Stephanie Beaton ) before he even gets his bandages removed.<br /><br />After he leaves the hospital , he finds his wife has been cheating on him too . When a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon ( with a fake tree branch on the foreground ) , he turns into a werewolf ! His torso grows larger , splitting his shirt , and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes . His pants stay intact . The mouth chews unconvincingly , though some sort of robotics ( or hidden hands ) in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times.<br /><br />Despite the poor werewolf costume , there is a fair amount of blood and gore , and those are fairly well done . There 's even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie . However , when a man falls from a height , a rather bad dummy does the job.<br /><br />Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is some sort of occult expert , and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named Androse who is also such an expert . They try to help him a little.<br /><br />Rich kills people who have done him wrong . A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on Beaton , who does n't much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it.<br /><br />Quite cheap , but between the nudity and blood and gore , and a not - terrible story combining ( sort of ) The Most Dangerous Game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man , it 's somewhat entertaining . Available on its own , or in the box set Scream Queens Vol . 1 .
0 Eyes of the Werewolf ( 1999 ) is a really bad movie . The premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible . I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production . Some blind dude gets some new eyes , bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf . Nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature . Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out ? Who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what 's up with that female cop ? If you really want to find out , check out Eyes of the Werewolf!<br /><br />Not a bad idea for a movie . I just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre - production before they decided to shoot the movie .
0 A group of hunters track down a werewolf , kill it , decapitate it and then sell the head to unethical Dr. Atwill ( played by director / writer Tim Sullivan ) , who runs a private clinic specializing in corneal transplants . Research chemist Rich Stevens ( Mark Sawyer ) , whose eyes were destroyed when acid flew into his face during a lab explosion , is the unlucky recipient of the werewolf 's eyeballs . It takes awhile to get to the first full moon , so first we get a tender love story between Rich and his compassionate , big - breasted nurse Sondra Gard ( Stephanie Beaton ) . Sondra is so compassionate that she strips off her clothing and starts riding Rich in bed before he even has a chance to remove his bandages ! After a month in the hospital , Rich returns home to icy wife Rita ( Deborah Huber ) , who promptly tells him " You look pretty ugly " before speeding off in her Kia . Our hero soon discovers that Rita is not only a bitch , but an adulterous skank who 's been carrying on an affair with his supposed friend Craig ( Lyndon Johnson ) . Finally , the full moon rises and Rich finds himself in a hairy predicament as he transforms into a ( very silly looking ) werewolf creature . Predictable carnage ensues.<br /><br />After ripping out Craig 's throat on a beach , Rich wakes up in the brush the next morning with his clothes tattered and vague recollections of the evening 's events . He makes friends with dwarf psychic / occult expert Andros ( Kurt Levi ) and is hassled by both local author Siodmak ( Jason Clark ) and lesbian - police - detective - in - a - pants - suit Justine Evers ( Tarri Markel ) . When Rich confronts Dr. Atwill , the doctor sends his sadistic bald henchman Kass ( Eric Mestressat ) , who gets a kick out of dismembering corpses with a machete at the clinic , after him . With help from Sondra , Rich manages to escape . Sondra takes him back to her place and basically rapes him on the couch during an overlong sex scene that lasts about five minutes . Will Rich be able to control his lycanthropy or find a cure for it before he claims more victims ? < br /><br />Shot on the cheap with a camcorder , this homemade werewolf flick has a somewhat unique premise with the eye transplant angle , but trots out cliché after cliché otherwise . The sets are sub porn level - the clinic scenes seem to have been filmed inside someone 's home or apartment . The wolf transformation scenes do n't even look as good as the time lapse photography used way back in the 1940s . Instead , they employ ragged editing . Throw some hair on the actor . Cut . Throw on some more on . Cut . More fur ... and fill his mouth full of white gunk he can spit out . Cut . No need to worry about continuity ! There 's no fade , no dissolve , nothing . It 's pretty sloppy . Once fully transformed , the werewolf costume ( designed by Jeff Leroy , who also edited and shot the movie ) is pretty awful . It has red , glowing Christmas bulb eyes , fur that looks like shag carpet and a plastic face that 's almost completely immobile . There are several times you can see the cameraman 's fingers in front of the camera lens , and does the moon really stay full five nights in a row ? As far as the cast is concerned , they 're amateurish , but tolerable . And as far as B horror flicks are concerned , there are worse out there . This one is paced fairly well , is only 70 minutes long and does provide plenty of the red stuff during the attack scenes , as well as the aforementioned T&A from Ms. Beaton.<br /><br />It was produced by David S. Sterling ( CAMP BLOOD ) , who was one of the first to ride the wave of digital video right when it was first starting to dominate the low - budget / independent horror genre scene back in the mid / late 90s . Many of his notoriously awful productions were released by Brain Damage Films , a label to avoid like the plague for the most part . Fx guy Jeff Leroy ( who is listed as co - director here at IMDb , but not in the film 's actual credits ) and Vinnie Bilancio ( who appears in a small role as one of the hunters ) went on to make the much more fun and polished exploitation flick WEREWOLF IN A WOMEN 'S PRISON in 2006 , which had a similar - looking creature on display ( red glowing eyes and all ) .
0 Bangville Police supposedly marked the debut of the Keystone Kops , named after the studio they worked for . In this one , however , they do n't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast - paced car that 's their trademark . Anyway , Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who 's begged her dad for a calf . She later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police . One answers and the chase is on . Next , Mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in . Turns out it 's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there ! So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture , the mother and father try to fight their way in ! This was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car . This was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it 's over before it 's begun . The only real characterization that 's developed is Mabel 's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except , of course , when she 's frightened . It 's easy to see why she became a star . It 's largely because of her that I 'd recommended seeing this at least once and why I 'm giving this a 4 .
0 The " Confidential " part was meant to piggy - back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name , while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline Congressional investigations of the day . However , despite the A - grade B - movie cast and some good script ideas , the movie plods along for some 73 minutes . It 's a cheap - jack production all the way . What 's needed to off - set the poor production values is some imagination , especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow . A few daylight location shots , for example , would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets . A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thick - ear material , but Salkow treats it as just another pay - day exercise . Too bad that Brian Keith 's typical low - key style does n't work here , coming across as merely wooden and lethargic , at the same time cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. goes over the top as a wild - eyed drunk . Clearly , Salkow is no actor 's director . But , you 've got to hand it to that saucy little number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication . Too bad , she was n't in charge . My advice-- skip it , unless you 're into ridiculous bar - girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait - jacketed 50 's fashion .
0 There 's nothing particularly original about this story of corrupt unions on one side and the " chief attorney " on the other . The stark but unimaginative lighting and photography stems from the fagged out noir cycle . The story could easily have been out of a Warner Brothers drawer with George Raft in the lead . The performances are routine , the direction flat , and even the set dressing perfunctory . ( An alley is shown by a single plaster wall of simulated brick . It has one poster on it . The poster says , " Post No Bills . " ) We are introduced to the story and some of the characters by a portentous narrator who informs us that , while most unions work hard and honestly to advance the causes of their members , a few are corrupt . But we do n't really get to know much about the unions or how they operate , although I suppose they were fair game after the success of " On the Waterfront " a few years earlier . Here they 're just a peg to hang the tale on . The real ring leader is a disbarred lawyer who runs things through three or four thugs . The District Attorney ( or whatever he is ) finds out , like Dana Andrews did in " Boomerang , " that the wrong man ( Dick Foran ) is charged with a murder and he spends the rest of the film almost alone , digging up evidence of Foran 's innocence . He gets into fist fights and shoot outs like any inexpensive movie private eye.<br /><br />Brian Keith is the D.A. He 's shown some insinuating displays of talent elsewhere , but here he spends most of the time speaking quietly and staring at the floor . Elisha Cook , Jr. , is a likable rummy but ca n't do a good drunk . Beverley Garland is okay but is undermined by the direction , which has her gawking in a night club when she should be furtive . The remainder of the cast would be suitable for a TV series.<br /><br />And nobody is helped by the writing . When a " B girl " is about to be shipped by the union mob to the Filippines , someone advises her that she only has to learn a few words of Spanish . " I only know one word , " she says , " Si . Yes . " The writers have not trusted the audience to know that " si " in Spanish means " yes . " The plot is clumsy and has holes in it . Keith visits a witness in her flat over a night club . He enters the door and has a gun shoved in his back by a yegg , but he outwits the heavy and knocks him out . Then the orders someone to call the police . The rest of the scene , played out at some length in the night club downstairs , forgets all about the police and they never show up , nor are they expected by anyone.<br /><br />It 's nothing to be ashamed of , and some people might enjoy it , but there is similar stuff , better done , elsewhere .
0 obviously has some talent attached , Maria Bello is always great . but this is just a dreary wast of time , portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an ' interesting ' story . well , i hope they got it out of their systems . unfortunately for the audience , there is no insight , no sensitivity , no context , and really no humanity . which would all be fine , except it has no humor , no horror , no context , and nothing constructive to say about the story it 's trying to tell . bad things happen , you sit and watch it , you do n't care , so what ? 99 % of the time , the words ' based on a true story ' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience . it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere , so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the ' true ' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work . i hope they had a great time making this movie . it stinks on ice .
0 As is often the case , films about self - loathing characters do not usually make for good drama . ' Downloading Nancy ' is no exception . It 's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who 's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.<br /><br />The protagonist is Nancy ( Maria Bello ) who is married to Albert ( Rufus Sewell ) . Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar / restaurants . Unlike most human beings , Albert has virtually no positive attributes ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world ) . Throughout the film , Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face . He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes . When his wife asks for sex , he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.<br /><br />Nancy is equally one - note as a character . Not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film ) . Her self - loathing takes the form of self - mutilation and a result , she 's forced into therapy . However , she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.<br /><br />Finally , Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet . He 's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo , who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot . It 's revealed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them ( the children 's mother no longer wants anything to do with him).<br /><br />Nancy 's plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then have him kill her . There 's a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass . These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis pays a visit to Albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club . It seems that Louis has a two - fold plan in going to see Albert : 1 ) berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2 ) enjoy the beating he receives . It takes awhile before Louis will reveal Nancy 's fatefirst , he forces Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future . Nancy 's fate of course is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some ' feelings ' for her ) . We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancy 's murder.<br /><br />What exactly are we to take away from a film such as Downloading Nancy ? Are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ? Is that the main point of the film ? Is sympathy for Nancy actually warranted ? I do n't think so . The film 's writers create a straw man in the character of Albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for Nancy 's decline . But are people so one - dimensional in real life ? I think not . They have the repulsive Louis , a man who makes a living by inflicting pain , come over and berate Albert for neglecting Nancy . Furthermore , his expressions of love towards Nancy ( before he kills her ) , is supposed to show his ' sensitive side'.<br /><br />In the end , it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film . They are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence , that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography .
0 Maria Bello does n't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles . Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in . Maybe she needs those movies , to get off the sugar coated ( aka " Hollywood " ) ones she does here and then ( Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3).<br /><br />While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do ( I wo n't spoil that ) , Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent / small movies she stars in . It 's her performance that elevates this movie . This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me . But in the end ( and even if I try to overlook some flaws , like bad pacing and dramaturgy ) , the movie is still too long
0 Although Misty Ayers ( burlesque stripper ) is certainly attractive as the blonde lead , this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times ( no nudity in 1954 when this film was made ; not 1965).<br /><br />The guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles Bud Abbott of Abbott & Costello . Most of the other woman are unattractive , and the drunken woman is semi - amusing in a creepy way.<br /><br />A 2 out of 10 . Ms. Ayers has a curvacious physique , but you ca n't judge any acting talent because the ENTIRE film is post - dubbed . Some of these " exploitation films " , usually made later than this one , are interesting in some way , but this is really a bore fest . Sid Melton ( MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY ) directed . There are some Samurai - like facial expressions and interesting apartments , but there 's really NOTHING here .
0 Released in 1965 , but clearly shot years earlier , this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front . As usual for grindhouse flicks of era , there 's a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music , annoying narration , and awkward editing . The coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork , as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines . All we get are reaction shots to the off - screen character 's voice ! 50s - pretty Misty Ayers strips to her French - cut panties a couple of times before the action gets started . She 's accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother - does - the - dishes , mixed randomly to produce , among other things , the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film . Watch as he taps it ! Watch as he strikes the match ! Will he inhale or will he be captured by Apaches ? Only time will tell ! ! The film tells the sordid tale of how Sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse , falls for a dope , and ca n't escape . For some reason , we 're treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film , literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the clientèle . Some stupendously lame comedy ( boozy dame accidentally drinks milk ! Har dee har ! ) and silent film acting does n't help . This is one of the worst feature films I 've ever seen , even on the Something Weird Video marquee . It 's really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema -- very bad cinema .
0 Obviously made to show famous 1950s stripper Misty Ayers " acting " talents . Too bad she ca n't act.<br /><br />Boring little tale about sweet , innocent Sally Down ( Ayers ) being drugged and forced into white slavery ( prostitution ) . Then she meets likable Tommy Cole who instantly falls in love with her . He wants to help her escape but can he ? You really wo n't care.<br /><br />There 's no real skin here -- Ayers just strips down SLOWLY to her underwear ( twice ) . The rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting , atrocious " comedy " ( never thought prostitution was funny but what do I know ? ) and terrible post - dubbed dialogue . I admit there was a twist at the end I did n't see coming but that 's not enough to sit through this . Also Ayers ' attempts at acting are hysterical ! A real bomb . Avoid .
0 Misty Ayers had a smoking body , and that 's all this movie was about . Pure exploitation flick . I started playing a game with myself , counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music . And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes . Case in point : casually walking into a room and saying " Hello " was scored with chase music from a roman epic . I 'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released . What I learned from this movie : that women 's low - rise panties existed in 1954 . I 'm talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties . At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing ( except for bra and panties , sadly ) . Also includes horrendous dubbing , leading to a " Look out ! Godzirra ! " effect .
0 Cheap , amateurish , unimaginative , exploitative ... but do n't think it 'll have redeeming amusement value . About as unentertaining , uninstructive and just plain dull as a film can be .
0 After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS I am still convinced that the first decent movie about ( teenage ) witches yet has to be made . I did n't think much of THE CRAFT and I 'm not into CHARMED either . The only film I more or less enjoyed ( about teenage witches ) was LITTLE WITCHES ( 1996 ) , and even that one was n't very good . But changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies , you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.<br /><br />I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80 's movie about teenage witches in high school . But I was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious . The acting is decent and serious all the time . No jokes are being played by teenagers or something . And the musical score , at first , I thought was pretty good . It added some scariness and also something ' classy ' , with the use of threatening violins and all . But as the movie progressed I came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious . They did n't have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.<br /><br />Then there 's Melissa Sue Anderson , who was the main reason for me to see this movie . A few weeks ago , I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME , a rather enjoyable , thick - plotted ( and goofy on some occasions ) slasher - movie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS . And I must say , she was very good as the icy - cold bad witch Vivian . But the main problem with the movie is : almost nothing happens ! Vivian causes a death and an accident , yes , but that 's it . Then there 's Robin , the good witch , who is just learning about her powers . And we expect the two of them using their powers more than once , but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles . That was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches ? And what 's worse , I was hoping to see a spectacular show - down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects , flaming eyes or whatever ... but nothing happens . There is sort of a confrontation in the end , but it 's a big disappointment.<br /><br />So , the acting of the two witches was good . The musical score was decent ( even though overly ambitious ) . And the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times . But that does n't make a good movie yet , does it ?
0 How could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10 ? How could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher ? Who is voting here ? I can only assume it is primarily kids -- very young kids . The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way . The story is stupid ; the acting is hard to even think of as acting ; the characters are characterless ; and the dialogue is terrible . I saw this one rainy afternoon on the Sci - Fi channel . In the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast , I suggest you read a book instead .
0 This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons . 1 ) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking , but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android . 2 ) It was n't an android at all , but a woman , the beautiful Jean Marsh.<br /><br />The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they 'd done it properly . In fact , the modernization of sex - bots are in the news as I speak.<br /><br />Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made , so they could have at least had her act like one . Her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element . Instead , it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star.<br /><br />The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity . Normally no one cared . But this episode seemed hamstrung by a Calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine , or downright carelessness .
0 If you have n't seen the gong show TV series then you wo n't like this movie much at all , not that knowing the series makes this a great movie . < br /><br />I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems.<br /><br />1 ) It 's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in , the late 1970 's and early 1980 's . 2 ) You get a lot of funny cameos of people you 've seen on the show . 3 ) It 's interesting to see Chuck ( the host ) when he is n't doing his on air TV personality . 4 ) You get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the TV show.<br /><br />I wo n't list all the bad things because there 's a lot of them , but here 's a few of the most prominent.<br /><br />1 ) The Gong Show Movie has a lot of the actual TV show clips which gets tired at movie length . 2 ) The movie 's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point . 3 ) Chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor , but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970 's flatness.<br /><br />It 's a good movie to watch when you do n't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once . Watch 20 minutes at a time and it 's not so bad . But even then it 's not so good either . ;)
0 No wonder this movie never saw the light of day . The timing was of the release was awful . The Gong Show had already " jumped the shark " by the time the movie came out , so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show ? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic , 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show . Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed - up millionaire life ? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life ? ( Obviously so , since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative . ) Did he think the gag of having everyone , everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes ? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn ? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode , but not as a full - length movie . However , it was nice to see Rip Taylor , Gene Gene , and the Unknown Comic again ( although , to make the movie " spicy , " they included only his most vulgar routines ) . And as someone else has pointed out , this is Phil Hartman 's first significant movie part ( even though it lasts only a minute ) . Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits , which is the name he was born with . You ca n't miss his voice and facial expressions , even though he 's much thinner and younger than in the SNL days . Ed Molinaro ( Hill Street Blues ) also has a tiny part ; one of his first after leaving the soap world .
0 Having searched for this movie high and low , I actually found it when I least expected , playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day . Why I searched endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris that was made during the last waning years of the TV show , I have n't a clue . The film is simply put horrible . The scripted part that deals with a week that is . Of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers that were " too hot for TV " or rejected for some reason or other . That part is still horrid , but campy bad which was enjoyable in it 's own way . Now that I saw what I sought after for so long will I watch it again in my lifetime ? Resoundingly NO ! ! Do yourself a favor and just watch the MUCH MUCH better " Confessions of a Dangerous Mind " or find old copies of the actual show . The girl act where there just lick popsicles provocatively was fun , but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon flash the audience has in all likelihood made me sterile . In hindsight , I 'm so very happy that this was massive flop , for if it was a massive hit , there could have been a " The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie " and THAT my friends would surely have brought upon the Apocalypse.<br /><br />My Grade : D
0 Easily the worst movie I have ever seen in my life . Direction : none . Story : pathetic . Screenplay : that will be a good idea . There is a lot of gratuitous graphics , all of pathetic quality . Preserve your sanity , do nt ever see this movie !
0 Let me state first that I love Westerns & Civil War stories . I also consider John Ford as an excellent director . I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne & William Holden 's acting ability.<br /><br />I can not remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959 . Last night was the first time I saw it since then.<br /><br />As per my 4 rating , one can say I did not like the movie.<br /><br />I now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings.<br /><br />John Lee Mahin who wrote the screenplay from Harold Sinclair 's novel , was a very gifted writer & wrote many fine scripts , This script is poorly written & badly researched . They make mention of the awful conditions of the Andersonville prison , At the time of the movie Andersonville was not in operation . They also use rifles that were not used at the time.<br /><br />John Ford was directing films for over 40 years & won 4 Oscars . He must have been ill during the making of this . His usual style was missing . It could be that this was film in the south & east and not in Monument Valley.<br /><br />He normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film , MOST were missing this time . This time only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have roles & of course Anna Lee has a small role . There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars . ( see below ) Mr. Fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were ; sadly missed here.<br /><br />Now we come to the main stars John Wayne & William Holden . The Duke also must have been ill , he seemed out of place here . This sort of role usually fit his style perfectly , he was just adequate here . Wiliam Holden did the best he could , but nowhere as good as he usually was.<br /><br />It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie . Here in her first major role ( second film ) is Constance Towers , a very beautiful person , But not really an actress , She is still having roles on Television . Let me be kind and say she has had a long career , more based on her looks than acting talent . Also in caas as Ms. Towers servant is Tennis Star Althea Gibson . I am glad she stuck to tennis.<br /><br />The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films There were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry , not good at all . The action scenes were good but come at the end of film.<br /><br />Ratings * 1/2 * ( out of 4 ) 47 points ( out of 100 ) IMDb 4 ( out of 10 )
0 Oh , how we have a misfire here ; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values ; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since D.W. Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as ' the yellow man ' ; characters so unimaginative and un - engaging that it 's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow , stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film.<br /><br />Prizzi 's Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post - modern disaster in every which way possible . The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing ; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character . Prizzi 's Honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo - noir , comedy , romance , action , gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story ; some sort of a sequence of good scenes ; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all.<br /><br />I'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is . Firstly , the film thinks it 's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time : of MY time . Charley Partanna ( Nicholson ) is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest more than an international hit - man . He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker ( Turner ) who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out , it appears all is not right . I read that the plot for this film is : " A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love , only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other . " Well , yes that 's true but that actual revelation does n't happen until about twenty minutes to the end ! Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of 60 : he walks around ; seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees ; he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on ( that actually happens off screen ) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard - bodied , best of the best , international hit - man.<br /><br />So with a main character who is un - likable and un - realistic , we move to the script . The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions : Partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again : " Do I marry her ? ; Do I love her ? What is love ? What do I do ? " and it gets so repetitive , it 's not even able to act as good humour . This twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone : a girl called Maerose Prizzi ( Huston ) played by director John 's daughter ; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it  that got me thinking , was this supposed to be funny ? Should I be laughing ? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding ( alá The Godfather ) and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters , police men and assassins were introduced into the film . But what we get is something very , very different.<br /><br />The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot ; right , the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick - start . I was so very wrong : with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way , we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office : this scene sums the film up . Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy . We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music ; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators ; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene is n't even edited correctly . Some suspense , some drama : " Do I shoot or do n't I ? " ; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it 's too late  anything but how it was actually executed . Prizzi 's Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax . It 's a film where cameras reflect in windows ; lights reflect in sides of cars and ' dead ' chauffeurs blink when nudged . Prizzi 's Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film - goer and do n't say it was a comedy because I did n't laugh with it  AT it is another matter . The film is repetitive , drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no Honour here .
0 Eight academy nominations ? It 's beyond belief . I can only think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards . With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leads I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway , but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me , and I feel distinctly cheated as a result.<br /><br />So it 's a black comedy is it ? Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzi 's Honor ? It 's certainly tasteless ( the shooting in the head of a policeman 's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life ) but with the exception of a joke about ' your favourite Mexican cigars ' ( which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years ) I failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and I did try . There is a lot of Mafia cliché but cliché does n't constitute humour in my book.<br /><br />Is it a romantic comedy of sorts ? Never . The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.<br /><br />Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia ? Not in a million years . The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd , and it usually just has the feel of a really bad ( and cheap ) Mafia movie . It feels more like a homage than a parody.<br /><br />With one - dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them , the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces . Well it is n't enough ; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression , Jack Nicholson ( repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brando 's padded jowls in The Godfather ? ... Oh ! Who cares ? ... all I know is , it is n't funny).<br /><br />Throw in some slow , plodding direction ( this film drags on for 2 hours ) , some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as ; " You remember the Camora ? Well we 're far bigger , we 'll track you down wherever you go " , and clichéd mannerisms and you 'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say " capiche ? " . Prizzi 's Honor is far from being Huston 's " masterpiece " and is rather a very poor last work . It 's definitely one work in the great director 's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the Hudson River .
0 This movie has not aged well . Maybe it 's just the impact and artful characterization , acting , and directing that we 've seen with The Sopranos , but I just viewed Prizzi 's Honor for the first time , on DVD , alone.<br /><br />The experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different , but I have to say , I was just appalled at the ending . Not just the violence of it , but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending.<br /><br />I enjoy a good shocker , but this seemed so out of character ... Also , when was this move supposed to be set ? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s , and yet the World Trade Center towers { completed in 1973 } were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes.<br /><br />Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person.<br /><br />Somehow , mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny . Mid - eighties , meet the late oughts : only of you can live .
0 I may not have the longest of attention - spans , but this is the second movie I have refused to see all the way through , and I even bought it on DVD because of its " classic " status . < br /><br />At first , I thought that the director was playing a big joke , so I kept waiting for a resolution , something to laugh at , something to keep my interest , but this resolution never came . Rather , the writing was laughably amateurish , the movie dragged on and felt disjointed , like someone cut a TV series to feature - length . The Academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight Oscars.<br /><br />Once again , I repeat myself . This is the second movie I have refused to watch all the way through . The first was " Exterminator " . I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is . 1/10
0 It 's boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one . Not because it 's abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated Prizzi 's Honor disappoints . Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it by this point in his career but I do n't buy it . Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO , a dark character study set in Mexico , that ranks among the finest he ever did . Prizzi 's Honor on the other hand , a film loaded with star power , good intentions and a decent script , proves to be a major letdown.<br /><br />The overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit - man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood by storm in the early 90 's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake , the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it 's trying to be : a romantic comedy , a crime drama , a gangster saga etc . Jack Nicholson ( doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing coming from Jack ) and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode , just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts . Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character 's motivations : she starts out the victim of her bigot father 's disdain , she proves to be supportive to her ex - husband , then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate.<br /><br />The colours of the movie have a washed - up quality like it was made in the early 70 's and Huston 's direction is as uninteresting as everything else . There 's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could 've been morphed to something better but what 's left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making .
0 Well then , what is it ? ! I found Nicholson 's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting . Angelica Huston 's character drained my power . And Kathleen Turner is a filthy no good slut . It 's not that I " do n't get it " . It 's not that I do n't think that some of the ideas could 've lead to something more . This is a film with nothing but the notion that we 're supposed to accept these ideas , and that 's what the movie has going for it . That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd , but then again , it is intended to be so . This however does not strike me as a.)funny , or b.) ... even remotely interesting ! ! ! This was a waste of my time , so do n't let the hype get the best of you ... it is a waste of your time ! With all that being said , the opening church sequence is quite beautiful ...
0 They had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors , the budget , and the story but the great director John Huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic . Strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very much . And also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action . Maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later .
0 I guess it 's Jack 's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is , but empathy comes at a price like all things - when he 's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it . He is a joke as a mafia - hit - man(also because the part does n't suit him one bit , him being so extroverted)and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this . Kathleen Turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde , because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes , when she opens them wide which she 's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and Anjelica Huston is the absolute same(granted interesting ) in everything , just like Robert Loggia . < br /><br />The movie is a lame draft(and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script ) of a gangster - movie , with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after - party faster(they certainly gathered the party - going elite in this ) . What , did they shoot it in 1 day ?- cause that would be the only explanation .
0 I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast . I have long had a theory about her , that she is a talented actress , but never seems to get to prove that , because she is always in this sort of low - budget B movie . She is still beautiful , and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in . This is no different . The film is often ugly and disturbing , but that does n't make it good . George Wendt played against type , and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role . Another note about Ms. Wuhrer . Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last . Perhaps reduction surgery , or ( more likely ) removal of implants . This NOT a bad thing . She still looks great . I would like to see her in a better movie .
0 This was a crappy movie , with a whole lotta non - sense and too many loose - ends to count . I only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ( Ron Livingston ) made a cameo in it , and I continued watching it because as a girl , I love any movie that includes male nudity for a change . Later , I found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get , and each time it got ... more ... ridiculous.<br /><br />Sean Crawley ( good - looking Chris L. McKenna , whom I 've never seen before - but LOVED his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter , when he meets electrician Duke Wayne ( George Wendt from " Cheers " ) . Thinking he 's getting more work from Duke , Sean agrees to meet contractor Ray Matthews ( Daniel Baldwin , playing a stereotypically evil guy ) . Ray is being investigated by a City Hall accountant ( Ron Livingston in a cameo , who I 've been in love with from " Office Space " up to " Sex & the City " ) . Ray end up offering the apparently desperate - for- cash Sean $ 13k to kill the accountant , and Sean accepts the job . Sean stalks out the accountant , whose wife ( Kari Wuhrer ) he finds himself attracted to , completes the hit , and leaves - taking the file of information against Ray with him . Sean quickly learns he was being used , that Ray never intended to pay him , and Sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.<br /><br />Up to this point , it 's a descent flick ... generally worth watching . But as soon as Ray , Duke and their crew kidnap Sean to muscle the information about the file out of him , it just got dumber and dumber ( and still DUMBER ... ) , until finally it seemed like the film 's writer , Charlie Higson , had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something . Without simply detailing the movie , let 's just say that in every - single - scene you watch after the kidnapping , you find yourself gasping " what the f**K ! , " baffled by the ongoing nonsense as Sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption . In the end , so many loose - ends are left in the movie , that you begin to regret that you even watched it.<br /><br />This is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable , and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it 's full value . It 's supposed to be a psychological thriller , and McKenna is a decent actor , but it 's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have " Norm " from " Cheers " and a Baldwin brother doing the dirty work , and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense . Guys will love the violence , blood and guts scenes , and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots . Girls will enjoy handsome Sean 's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie , when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie . Personally , I hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ( Ron Livingston ) is only in the first one - third of the movie .
0 i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; " Rated R for strong violence and sexuality , nudity and language".<br /><br />which correctly , IMO , should state ; " Rated R for strong violence , sexuality , nudity and language".<br /><br />the word " sexuality " should come after a " comma " , not an " and " because of the huge difference in meaning it make . i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts ALMOST non - existent . my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like " vivid " movie . that is why i felt cheated . story - wise , it was so - so , after - all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it . i know i don't.<br /><br />of course , this is only my opinion.<br /><br />Joseph
0 Why oh why do n't blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point ? Everyone in the cinema , young and old , was there to see talking animals make jokes , and whilst they did that we were all happy ... And then , as with Lost In Space , came the two killer blows - plot and sentiment . Who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with his daughter ? Not me , that 's for sure .
0 this show is one of the worst shows of ALL TIME ! absolutely no original jokes and they 're always a year late . like in 2009 they will finally say something about Michael Vick 's dogfights . all of the cast members are people who wanted to be on S.N.L but had to go to the lowest of the low , mad TV.its an hour of mad magazine jokes witch are n't funny to begin with , told by terrible John Stewart wanna bees . so if you have any problem tell me i d love to hear the opinion of the 3 people who watch this show . family guy put it well " Osama bin Ladin was hiding in the one place no one would look , the cast of mad TV . There is a reason why no one watches the show .
0 In the glory days of the 90s ( god rest its soul ) you could turn on the great Comedy Central at any hour of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time Saturday Night Live . Whpat a glorious show that was , whether it was the original Not - Ready - for - Primetime Players or the second golden age of SNL featuring the greats- Chris Farley , Adam Sandler , David Spade ... and then , it all went to hell . I was first exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago , and I think I must 've passed out from shock . How could a show so terrible prevail for so long ? There are so many horrible flaws . I suppose I 'll start with the writing . The writing , for most part , is terrible . It is nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor . The cast , for the most part , is talentless . There are a few sketches I have enjoyed , such as some of Ms. Swan and Stuart , and there are a few talents on the show such as the magnificent Alex Borstein . Phil LaMarr is a talented actor , just not as a comedian . Although there a few sparse ha ha moments , they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible drivel populated by babbling idiots . Miss this one .
0 Horrible , horrible TV show ! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me . It really sucks ! I am , of course , speaking about the seasons after the first two . The first two seasons were golden , and if I was exclusively talking about those seasons , this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars . None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good . They were , and are , awful . The comedy is not funny at all . AT ALL ! ! ! < br /><br />The original cast was full of very talented comedians , like Artie Lange , Phil LaMarr , and Mary Schorr ( or whatever her name is ) , all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV . This show is highly overrated , and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live , another horrible show . Go out on Saturday night and have fun , and leave MAD TV to wither and die , as it deserves to .
0 You 've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication , drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie - making : between 1985 and 2000 , he made a whopping 34 films . Unfortunately , if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by , they 're probably all crap ( and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead , who have escaped from a top - secret army base located directly beneath their school . Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund ( which relies heavily on liberal use of the f - bomb ) director Sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind - numbingly awful performances from his talent - free cast , dreadful visual effects ( some crap CGI and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space - shuttle ) and his trademark shoddy gore ( handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims ' clothing).<br /><br />Finally , after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives , and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards , Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time - travel / paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re - watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film . Honestly ... once was enough , Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again ?
0 Why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie ? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were stupid enough , but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy ( Perhaps of all time ) . Todd Sheets is still the director , but no longer the screenwriter , which is n't a negative or a positive , considering he 's just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one . The writing is too heavily reliant on the f - word , which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at nausea . The acting is about on par with the last two Bloodbath movies , so naturally , it 's some of the worst I 've ever seen . The special effects are better than the last 2 , but they still look godawful . The plot has become too complicated for it 's own good , and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced . Also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel , leading to one of the most idiotic endings I 've ever seen . After the movie it goes to outtakes , which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake . Only see this to make fun of it , because if you go into this with a serious mind , you might possibly kill yourself.<br /><br />My rating : BOMB/****. 95 mins .
0 I really liked ZB1 . Really , I did . I have no problem with extremely low - budget movies , and I have enjoyed movies with worse production values than ZB3 ( if you can imagine such a thing . check out ' wiseguys vs. zombies , ' if you 're interested ) . Indeed , I prefer lower budget zombie films , because I am suspicious that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are ' about.'<br /><br />But ZB3 was just so bad . It was retarded . I do n't want to bother being dignified in my criticism . I want my 90 minutes back , etc . Except that it really only took ~80 minutes , because partway through I put it into 1.4X fast forward.<br /><br />Okay , here 's some criticism.<br /><br />1 . The pacing was TERRIBLE . Everyone talked in monologues . Even when someone just had a single line , the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of F - bombs into every sentence made the line FEEL like a monologue . At first I was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to ZB1 's 70 minutes , but there were actually fewer ' events ' in ZB3 . It 's all talking.<br /><br />2 . The gore effects got stupider . Just glop rubbed around on people 's tummies.<br /><br />3 . Despite the epic exposition , there really was n't a plot . And the exposition is indeed epic ! I wo n't spoil it , if you 're going to watch it . ( Do n't watch it . ) But then , it 's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for ~80 minutes . or fewer , if you so choose .
0 For the life of me I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say so .... I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in the " lifestyle " ... This movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the Army , in combat or at a team or platoon level.<br /><br />Three EOD guys trouncing around Bagdad on their own ? ? ? ? ? Get Real ... No chain of command ? ? ? ? ? Get Real ... EOD clearing buildings ? ? ? Get Real .... EOD/ Military Intelligence / Sniper qualified buck sergeant ? ? ? ? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all ? ? ? ? Get Real .... I carjack an Iraqi civilian , while I am only armed with a 9 mil , break into another civilians house , get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of Bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation ? ? ? ? Get Real ... <br /><br />There is absolutely no adherence to military protocol { Army } and no resemblance at all to any Army unit that I have even encountered . Totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job .
0 I really wanted to like this movie , but ended up bored and incredulous . The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is , naturally , shaky . But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode , even during quiet conversational moments , to the point of ridiculousness . Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams ? The fact that it was shot on 16 mm does n't help , as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky . < br /><br />For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment , there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie 's credibility . < br /><br />- A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot , and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand - held extinguisher . < br /><br />- A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004 , but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack . - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range , where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target . < br /><br />- I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base , not some random spot in the middle of the desert . < br /><br />- The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone , a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within . The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences , yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents . Oddly , James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves , thus setting up the attempted kidnapping . < br /><br />- Speaking of which , the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings , chasing insurgents etc . on their own , even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there . < br /><br />- How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he 's not faking it?<br /><br />There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation . I had no idea who the EOD team reported to , nor were any other characters fleshed out . These are things the characters would know , so we should too.<br /><br />Many of the " surprises " and scenes are perfectly predictable . Yes , it 's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis he 's trying to move along , that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming , and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle.<br /><br />Finally , there was an almost complete lack of character development . Renner 's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home , is reckless and addicted to adrenalin . He 's exactly the same at the end of the movie . What 's the point?<br /><br />If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies , it 's a sorry bunch . Just based on the half hour I saw of it , I 'd recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead .
0 Like a latter day Ayn Rand , Bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough American hombres stuck in Iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless , relentless , child - killing Arab terrorists . As Bigelow posits the Iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama , one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty , hot , ugly rubble that is Iraq , and a new hero is born.<br /><br />The new guy is what John Hershey described in his book , and later the movie , The War Lover , as a sadistic wingnut who actually is n't fit for civilian life , and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires . The war lover can only fully function in war , peacetime suffocates him . While Hershey chastised the war lover , ( played in the film by Steve McQueen in one of his greatest roles ) Bigelow glorifies him . The army needs war lovers , they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies . We ca n't handle the truth , that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers , the toughest men . According to the unironic Bigelow , regular men are pussies , the war lover is a special breed , the last of the cowboys . So what if he wants to bare - back his men , or fondle an Iraqi boy ? He is a throwback to the sex - and - death cult of war . In war , sex is a thankless , loveless , don't - ask , don't - tell kind of male bonding . Bigelow has no opinion on this ; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham - fisted attempt at realism . Only a war - lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong , between American innocence and Arab perfidy . Bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism . She 's just another gung - ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit.<br /><br />On the political front , Bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichés again and again , ad nauseam : the wonderful world of the open frontier , which happens to be some one else 's country . ( " You can shoot people here " says a soldier ) ; the tough but human black guy companion , the soldier with a premonition of death , the gruff , possibly crazy commanding officer , the college - educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy . You name it , Bigelow resurrects it.<br /><br />The man - boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute Arab boy who befriends the war lover , but Bigelow plays it straight ; she does n't consummate the sex , just sanitizes it . What Bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly , sneering face of the Arab enemy . Any Iraqi who is n't pure evil is either demented , hostile or up to no good , anyway . They all deserve to die for their impudence , and many of them do in this glib gore - fest film . The Iraqi women are all hysterical , they only make their presence known by screaming . They could be male stunt men in drag for all I know , you never see their faces . There is no female presence at all on base or in battle , although female casualty rates in Iraq would certainly disprove this.<br /><br />Bigelow goes through all the motions one by one . She glorifies war , she canonizes the sadist nut - case hero . The cowboys , surrounded by the subhuman Indians , prove their mettle by doing God 's work and subduing the wretched terrorist - infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania . Toward the end , I felt like rooting for the Indians . In Bigelow 's world , though , no mercy or understanding ever makes it through . The Iraqis are dehumanized par excellence . The slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero 's psycho sexual struggle . Every U.S , bullet finds its mark . You have to love the guy , the war lover . It 's just his way , he is the true hero . He 's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way , and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side .
0 I 'm a huge fan of war movies , and , as a Vietnam combat vet , have some experience with the technical details . I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them . Other vets , and Iraq vets in particular , have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well . Poetic license is one thing , but this movie is a complete fantasy , and fails badly because of it . No bomb disposal unit , or any unit , would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes . Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives . The opening scene particularly annoyed me . The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately . Yelling , " Stop dialing " is not an effective deterrent . It got worse from there . The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious . As others have noted , your average EOD guy does n't know jack about being a sniper , and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination . Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just would n't happen . Somebody might shoot him , but this kind of risk - taking is limited to the movies . I could go on , but , as I said , others have pointed these things out in detail . This is not a good movie , and if it wins any awards at all , it 's a further reflection of why " La La land " is so named .
0 I saw this movie once , and I thought it was OK . Then my friends at work said " Watch it again , it 's better " . So I did . And to my surprise , it was WORSE on the second time ! There 's a word limit , so I 'm going to get the ball rolling here.<br /><br />-The bombing scenes were all so stupid . Why on earth would anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion ? ? ? -None of the characters here are even remotely likable . Not on the first time , not even the second.<br /><br />-Oh , and last time I checked , a car does not explode from a single gun shot , nor can a fire THAT huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher ... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie ? ? ? -The camera is so shaky , I can barely tell what is going on . That opening scene with the robot had my stomach off - put , the rest of the movie was not much better.<br /><br />-The sniper scene . The McManus Brothers ( from " The Boondock Saints " ) would roll their eyes , it was so stupid . First off , why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot ? Furthermore , why would he spend THAT much time cleaning the bullets , reloading , aiming and NOT get shot , when there was so much chaos going on around him ? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back ? ? ? ? ? ? Huh ? ? ? ? ? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ? ? ? I did n't mean to sound homophobic , but honestly , that scene was so ridiculous.<br /><br />-Too long for its own good , yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it . Bigelow seems to think that the more action , the better . Looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot . I know Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes , but at least that movie did n't drag . This movie , on the other hand , does , and for it , feels longer.<br /><br />The only good thing was Renner , who was satisfactory at best . But do yourself a favour , just skip this , and do n't give into the hype .
0 watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home.<br /><br />That in itself sounds boring . Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left , it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on . hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home.<br /><br />I must be missing something . I 'm a great fan of war films if they are done well . This had " jarhead " syndrome . A film that at times was beautifully shot , but cinematography does n't stop it from being totally dull and pointless.<br /><br />And get over the slow mo " cartridges coming out of the gun " shot already . they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it.<br /><br />I did n't have any empathy for the main guy in it , i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die . In fact the film would have worked much better if he had.<br /><br />I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it , and everyone else loved it . I have never been in the forces , and I 'm with them . It 's pretentious drivel . the 3 stars are for the cinematography .
0 Some unrealistic movie spoilers included.<br /><br />From real life experiences , this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning . I 'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man . This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences . From the very start to name a few : the bomb cart , the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts , the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC , having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs , to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy , the sniper scene . The list would continue , however , it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect ; and the point was made.<br /><br />This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military.<br /><br />People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy .
0 I just rented this today .... heard lots of good reviews beforehand . WOW ! ! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is ! ! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back ? ? ? ? Finally someone bumped " Stop - loss " from the ' Worst Iraq War Movie Ever ' number one spot . To be fair , I do n't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway , but this was REALLY bad . < br /><br />I wo n't get into any technical inaccuracies , there 's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all . If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E - nothing about technical accuracy however they could 've made the movie somewhat realistic .... maybe . I guess the writer should be given the " credit " for this waste of a film . He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality . Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was ? Was there a message ? Seriously though ..... WTF????<br /><br />I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really . This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that , the plot sucks , characters are shallow ( to say the least ) and the acting is poor at best . It 's ironic , I suppose , that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal , because it 's the biggest bomb I 've seen this year .
0 I love a good war film and I fall into the " been there , done that " category . So I would like to think my review is an accurate one ( IMHO ) . Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish . There is no way I can recommend this film to you.<br /><br />It started off with me shouting at the TV saying " you would n't do that " etc ... but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit . But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud ... I was right.<br /><br />There simply was n't any logic to the EOD scenes . I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger . So much so I was left scratching my head all the time . Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert . One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors.<br /><br />The sniper scene was just so laughable . It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then . Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience . It started with the " Contact Right " and went down hill fast . If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day . Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all . You are just left watching and asking why has n't it ended yet?<br /><br />Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh .. another scene where you just wanted it to end . It added nothing to the film.<br /><br />Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down . This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched . It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline ... it was senseless and awful . I still do n't understand why they wasted time on it . Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter . Pure comedy : ) < br /><br />The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be . I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different . But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death . All I wanted was for it to end . It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid , senseless , action(ish ) scenes.<br /><br />There is no way I can recommend this . Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just does n't make sense . The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be the 24/7 work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good . Sorry folks ... it just ain't!<br /><br />Not recommended ... it will just bore you .
0 As usual , I am making a mad dash to see the movies I have n't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars . I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley . I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has . There is no story ! ! A group of guys meander around Iraq . One day they are here diffusing a bomb . Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside , by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire . No wait here they are back in Bagdad . There is no cohesive story at all . The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures . By that I mean , we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying . We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe . And then we have the daredevil cowboy who does n't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs . What do you think is going to happen ? ? ? Well , do you think the cowboy soldier who does n't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways ? ? Why yes ! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy ? Why yes ! There is no story here . The script is juvenile and predictable ! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look " artsy " . And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture , go rent " Full Metal Jacket " , " Deerhunter " or " Platoon " . Do n't waste time or money on this boring movie !
0 COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS ..... I'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest .. really am . All I saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say . ( Note to self must check the rating for Platoon on here)This movie was so black and white ... Americans good ... anyone else either evil or useless . I take it the British troops in it were meant to be SAS ( one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with I 'm pretty sure ) they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the US troops who were n't even Elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky Iraqis . Aye dead - on strings to mind . The only good thing I have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the SAS man ... muzzle flash from distance , good noise used ... really well done that bit but the rest ... Spare me what am I 10 years of age over here ? ? ! ! Well I 'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it.<br /><br />SPOILER ... Oh aye and in the main crazy , wild guy ca n't stay at home with his wife and young child .. no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war ! ! Why ... because young men need thrills or something apparently . Like say I 'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am.<br /><br />P.S. I 'm not hating America I 'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war ( in my eyes ) which OK fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it 's a just war for whatever messed up reason ( wanted to say something else her but censored ) but hey that 's up to them . But to churn out a movie so one - sided like it 's black and white ... good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child . In war there is a lot of grey and it 's two ( sometimes more)sides who believe in what they are fighting for . Not Star Wars with something something dark side verses the goodies . F ' sake Hollywood at times you really do take people for mugs ... then again 7.8 .... well maybe you are right to but I 'll not be buying it . Glad I downloaded this movie tell you all that for nothing . ;)
0 There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award . Well , it does not deserve an audience as well . Ironically , one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly , the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least . Every frame , you feel you are getting the " full picture " , its like someone is " cropping your view " from the edges . The story is pathetic . Well , I will be honest , I could not bear to watch the entire movie . The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor . These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal.<br /><br />Take my advice , stay away from this piece of crap .
0 I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one . " The Hurt Locker " has won more " Best Picture " awards from the critic groups than any other film this year . However , not only did I not like it , I found it hard to sit through.<br /><br />There is minimal plot and little character development . They disarm bombs , fight , and disarm more bombs . That is the entire movie . < br /><br />But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking . This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap , documentary look to it . The camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.<br /><br />I normally do n't care for war movies and " The Hurt Locker " was no exception . But you do n't need to take my word for it because the critics love it .
0 Well I too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the Best Picture Oscar so I went to see it today . What a major disappointment ! 1 ) If you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the U.S. military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are . They mirrored my own thoughts ; as the movie played I - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself , " say WHAT ? there 's no way that would happen like that .. " 2 ) There 's very little that actually happens in terms of plot . A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed ( a death that is n't really clearly explained ) . The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work . His attitude puts others at risk . THAT 'S IT ! 3 ) This movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed . If you want suspense try one of the Bourne movies . If you want to see a war movie that 's emotionally powerful , try renting Go Tell The Spartans , which is about the Vietnam War , and stars Burt Lancaster ( who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work , and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over - hyped Apocalypse Now ) , or an old WWII black and white classic Sink The Bismark , which , especially for an English film , is unbelievably heart - wrenching . DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON Hurt Locker .
0 Who did the research for this film ? It 's set in Baghdad in 2004 , however all the Soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern gear . No one was wearing that stuff in 04 . < br /><br />I just saw this film while deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was WTF ? This movie made no sense , had characters come and go with no explanation , and people doing ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life . I realize that it 's a movie , but it 's obviously trying to portray something realistic . It fails miserably , but it 's trying . < br /><br />It 's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas , chewed them up and swallowed , then vomited out a film . I would not recommend this film to anyone . I 'm still not sure why I sat through the whole thing . GI Joe was one that really made you think compared to this . STAY AWAY !
0 REALLY ? ? ? < br /><br />I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here ! < br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It is one big pathetic , grainy , cliché . I would have laughed out loud , and a lot , but was on a date with an ex - military guy . I could not hide my other response , BOREDOM . Yes , I think my date , a flat - line " good old boy " , liked it . That 's not a compliment . I know an actor wants to work .... Fine for the others . But Ralph , come on.<br /><br />It was a painful tease from Ralph . I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING . But I must plead , Ralph , how could you ? And , why ? ? < br /><br />I'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now .... C1
0 This whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum . Although an interesting concept / theme , it really did not develop as a story . Once the initial idea of a brave ( stupid ? ) bomb disposal expert ( cowboy ? ) are introduced , and this happens very early in the film , the rest is repetitious . Characters were not explored , and aspects of the location and politics were ignored . There was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment , and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe . But the way in which the unit operated stretched belief ! Individual performances were good , and special effects were adequate , but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content .
0 ... And being let down bigger than ever before . I wo n't make any direct references or anything here , but to say the least , this film is pathetic . If you 're military trained , do n't bother watching . I put it on the DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick . Why could n't I just have read the reviews first.<br /><br />Already at the first " bomb " scene the film has huge glitches , and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger . My 2 friends , not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker 's mistakes almost as fast as I myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we 're realistic . Well , as you might have guessed , they 're not - at all.<br /><br />Avoid this movie unless you 're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re - occurring mistakes being made . 2/10 for catching my interest at first .
0 I decided to watch this one because it 's been nominated for Oscar this year . I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie , but ended up bored and disappointed . First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in " shaky hands " camera mode is really annoying.<br /><br />i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:<br /><br />American " military machine " ( people , who makes money on war ) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something ( sort of ) patriotic.<br /><br />why these " heroic " efforts of director and the main character to _ inspire _ the audience with an idea of " loving - war - like - a - drug " ? .. Oh , please , come on ! what a bore ! < br /><br />watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall ...
0 I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about , and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6 ( ? ) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as of today.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction Oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and I wonder why ? Did the totally unrealistic ' cowboy ' bomb disposal - man storyline mean anything to somebody that I failed see ? Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing ' brave deeds ' in the Wild Wild West infected with ' evil ' Red Indians ; but just that it was set in a different background this time ? Was it given the Oscars because the director being ex of James Cameron , and made it a nice underdog ( gossipy ) story for day time TV shows to munch on ? Or was it some sort of Emperor 's Clothes syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but just could n't say so because others did n't seem to be saying it out aloud?<br /><br />And finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high - resolution - super - slow - mo as if to convey a ' deep message ' or something ? Something in the lines of ' EOD guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time ' ? Was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason ? And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing for that??<br /><br />If you have n't seen this yet , do n't waste your money on tickets . Wait till they run it on TV in a few years . You are not going to miss much .
0 Let 's start by the simple lines . From the viewer 's side , there a couple of good " director details " , some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice . The special effects are good enough , a good acting / good scenery also . But the story is way too simple . It shows how a elite Army bomb squad unit lives , acts and sometimes dies . It shows the drama of living in war . In my movie experience as a serious action movie " addicted " guy , I missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen . One of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to I consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time . It did n't happened to me . I stayed " conscious " , for the entire movie.<br /><br />Honestly speaking , I think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the " subconscious " appeal of American patriotism , a healthy and genuine feeling , but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator . More than a movie about war , it grows its popularity based on that.<br /><br />A simple thought : if this was a world war II or I movie , only changing time , with everything remained the same , would it be this awarded ? Sure not . Why ? Because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high.<br /><br />Compared against its rivals in the Oscars , I do n't think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded .
0 Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan . He also happens to be a highly - qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul , operating on wounded NATO soldiers . On a particularly difficult mission , he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards . He is then finally promoted to sergeant , but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career , so he quits from the Army altogether . One year later , frustrated with civilian life , he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform .
0 I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow 's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded . Unfortunately it really is n't a good movie . The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts , but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard . The actors put in a good effort , but for me I did n't really get what the movie was trying to be . It 's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket , not as epic as Band of Brothers , not as action packed as ... well , anything . I certainly ca n't see why it was nominated for so much , nor why people are ' hyping it up ' to these epic proportions . Mind you , given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years I suppose there 's not a lot to choose from .
0 Yes , this movie is a real thief . It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war - hero movie to boost the acceptance ( support ? ) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today . I do not really want to go here into politics , but come on , this is more clear than the summer sky . Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding , no real plot at all . I really feel myself in the 50 's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like . The same propaganda movies were produced that time , only with the exception that those were black and white . Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the " U.S. wars are cool " genre , you surely have much better movies to choose from .
0 i was intrigued to see how a little - seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker . sadly , all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off - the - screen reasons.<br /><br />the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see . when it 's not busy being yet another Bourne Identity homage with dire , annoying " shaky cam " visuals , it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing.<br /><br />the " plot " is threadbare , the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue - on the instances where the film gives up on being " minimalist " and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes - is some of the worst ever recorded . in fairness , the actors do the best they can in the circumstances , just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.<br /><br />the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of " mockumentary " that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re - edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.<br /><br />if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back , and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life .
0 I rented this film on Netflix after it won all the Oscars , to see if it was really that good.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrayal ( for the most part ) of a group of soldier 's rotation in Iraq . The film centers around Will James , a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks , and defusing bombs.<br /><br />Where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the Plot and Direction of the movie . This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down . What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters , and their different attitudes about the war . Bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters , but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag . Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long , yet it feels like a 3 hour movie.<br /><br />One scene in the movie that was particularly awful , and ruined the films perfect credibility , was the sniping scene halfway through the movie . It was both unrealistic , and very long.<br /><br />Overall , I thought this film was OKAY , but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 , was because it was a major letdown for winning Best Picture at the Oscars . I felt like this film could have been so much better considering Saving Private Ryan lost Best Picture , but was much better than this film . Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down which only won 2 Oscars . I honestly do not know how this won best picture.<br /><br />If you are looking for an action packed war flick , rent Black Hawk Down . This film will be forgotten in a year or two .
0 REALLY ? REALLY ? ? ? ? I know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage . Horrible in every sense . Terribly inaccurate in so many ways . I have an easier time believing the president of the United States suiting up , flying a jet fighter , and shooting down aliens . It is easier to note the few things that were right . My jaw dropped when I saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years . It was overacted , seemingly pointless plot diversions , and had questionable cinematography at times.<br /><br />X - box , YouTube , ACUPAT utilities   did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004 ? It 's not like you had to do extensive research , it was only five years before this movie came out . I am an Iraq war Veteran and if you spent ONE day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad you would realize how B.S. this movie is . To compare this to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ludicrous . Why do n't you just throw Commando and Red Dawn in there too ; I think those might be more accurate . < br /><br />If for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot , the historical and factual discrepancies , then this movie might just be OK . Nothing more . If you keep on hearing " Oscar buzz " , and have to add your own pompous review , go right ahead . As for me , I am writing the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back .
0 As an ordinary movie - watcher I ca n't say I enjoyed watching this one . It 's not too emotional for a drama , not too gripping for a thriller , not too fast for an action . Plus , some moments of the movie are hardly credible . OK , I understand , soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there , but it 's hard to believe that a person would risk his life , carjack into the middle of a hostile city , and after being shouted at by a professor 's wife run away , without having asked a question ( in a proper way ) . It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so , but it 's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war .. There are several episodes like this , so the whole picture makes an impression that it 's just a raw preview of a movie , and it needs considerable work.<br /><br />It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier , but all these ' curves ' of his psychology seem simply unnatural.<br /><br />This picture left a question in my head : WHY ? Why they gave it an Oscar ? Why SIX ? And IMHO it 's the most thrilling part of the movie :)
0 I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home . We have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like . The film was a total waste of time , if I went out to buy it I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw that it costs $ 49.<br /><br />The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across Canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speed.<br /><br />There was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product . If I would of done this project I would of provided more footage , paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery . To make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min . Oh yes the case said it was in stereo , the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound , thet could of at least put some music to it.<br /><br />If you want a good cross Canada film watch The railrodder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster keaton ( the one of the last film he made ) in this comical film Buster Keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia
0 If this movie as meant to discourage people from doing drugs , it fails . I was ready to start using them I got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did . This movie is neither horror or drama . It 's just the paranoia of meth users . This movie may win an award for the using the " F " word so many times and so uselessly . It was not well stated , but I felt like they were making Meth to replace Meth they owed to someone . Hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless . The ending really made no sense . The movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth - head . I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average .
0 I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark . The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it . The camera work , ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which I could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it was n't . The sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well . I see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but do n't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything , keep your expectations low and you 'll get more out of it . At least it was only an hour and a half . Oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me . But I 'm a movie snob so take that for what that 's worth .
0 Judging by the hype , and other reviews on this site , I was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies . What i got was complete crap focusing on junkies . I wonder if there 's another movie called " Cookers " that these people reviewed ? There are only 3 main characters , and none of them struck me as well - written or well - acted . Basically the whole movie I just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor . Do n't rent this movie . Rent " Cabin Fever " or some other decent horror movie . Hell , rent " Mary Poppins " ! The animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you 'll find in " Cookers . "
0 I wanted to like this movie , but many elements ruined it for me . The use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head , but it did make me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments . The movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting . I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld , but this film could n't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction .
0 Lame plot and two - dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut - outs . Needless to say , this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters , especially the fiancé ; He looked and acted more like a cartoon . In summary , I guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for TV drama . It uses just about every cliché in the book . The tortured classical musician who wants to break - out and play salsa . The free - spirited fiancée engaged to a " bean counter " personality she does n't love . I wo n't list them or else it would be a spoiler because I 'd be giving away the whole plot . The dancing was OK but nothing special . I 've seen worse . 3 stars for good music . The band was really tight . I saw it on YouTube . Thankfully I did n't pay good money to see it at a theater . I 'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished .
0 After having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country , I but wanted to see it . But - what a disappointment ! To see a bunch of one - dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend . I sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland .
0 Fiction film ( it lists as based on a story though it does have a " documented by " credit ) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.(They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device ) . Its lots of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness . There are some attempts at creating tension and scares , but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds . This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film , it promises you so much , a look at Bigfoot , but in reality it delivers very little . Recommended for insomniacs only
0 As a teenager , I was pretty into the whole Bigfoot thing - I read the books and followed the reported sightings . As a more jaded adult , I 've largely given up on the big guy now , but do n't mind watching the odd movie when I come across one . This one had a few strong points to it - mainly , the recreations of two of the more famous Bigfoot encounters - the Ape Canyon incident of 1924 and the Bauman incident of c.1850 as related to and by Teddy Roosevelt , both of which I 'm somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading I did . The movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch , whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations , but the recreations were well done . There 's also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous Patterson video , again taking for granted its authenticity . The sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men . Unfortunately , in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes , whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half.<br /><br />It 's the fictional story ( done in a documentary style ) of an expedition to a remote area of northern British Columbia , to the suspected home range of the sasquatch . A computer had targeted this area based on sightings and - in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie - the computer also used " eyewitness sightings " to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the " creature " of the Patterson video ! Aside from those 20 minutes I mentioned , we basically watch this expedition travel , which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip . I 've been on camping trips with the guys . Let me tell you - they 've never been worthy of a movie . Interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots ( although one suspects that canned footage was used , or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals ) and there are some spectacular scenery shots , except that the scenery is n't of northern British Columbia , it 's from national parks in Oregon.<br /><br />I did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch , so we did n't have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this . 3/10
0 This is a typical low budget 1970 's mess . It 's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest . Every character is a stereotype , from the Native American to the cynical cowboy . The acting and narration are a complete joke . If you 're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage - keep hoping . There wo n't be much , and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder ; it would look better than this movie.<br /><br />It 's not that I do n't like 1970 's low budge fare ; I do . It 's that this is such a mess of bad acting , bad characters , lousy story and no thrills that you just ca n't enjoy it . It does not fit into the " so bad it 's good " category , nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances . It 's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping , hiking , riding horses , and watching wild life . There is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid ; supposedly our friend Sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him . By that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker 's heads and stop the whole thing .
0 I was about 7 when this DIRE MONSTROSITY of a film was released . In the UK it was advertised on the TV in the summer of 1977 for weeks , as if it were some incredible blockbuster film . It was actually the first film I ever saw at a cinema , and I was put off going for years to come . The following week I was invited to go and see the new film " Star Wars " and I declined . To this day I have never seen it , in protest at having to watch Sasquatch ! Seriously , even at the age of 7 I could tell that I was watching garbage . It 's just so bad , it 's almost unbelievable . Rambling nonsense that should NEVER have made it to a cinema . I was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again , just as well as far as I 'm concerned . AVOID AT ALL COSTS ! ! !
0 When you 're making a thriller about witchcraft , I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work . Some pictures ( " Rosemary 's Baby " , for example ) have accomplished this ; others ( like " Necromancy " ) have n't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy . This film does have some atmospheric moments , but about half the dialogue is hard to make out ( sometimes it 's poorly recorded , at other times just incomprehensible ) and Orson Welles , who gets top billing , has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work . Or maybe he was simply having fun ..... (*1/2 )
0 I imagine that the young people involved in the making of " Necromancy " ( aka " The Witching " plus a bunch of other titles ) must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who : participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play ( " The Cradle Will Rock " ) ; scared people into thinking that aliens were invading ( " The War of the Worlds " ) ; and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time ( " Citizen Kane " ) . And now Orson Welles was starring in a third - rate flick about a satanic cult.<br /><br />There 's basically nothing creative about this movie . Lots of nudity , but the background music always proves really distracting . Even if the movie was n't particularly predictable , it still was n't worth seeing . How low Welles had sunk . Fortunately , over the final thirteen years of his life , he narrated the documentary " Bugs Bunny Superstar " ( about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s ) and hosted the documentary " The Man who Saw Tomorrow " ( about Nostradamus ) . I recommend those two , but not this one . Just avoid it.<br /><br />Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean .
0 Like most comments I saw this film under the name of The Witching which is the reissue title . Apparently Necromancy which is the original is better but I doubt it.<br /><br />Most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad . In many ways I think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value ! But do n't be fooled -there 's only 3 scenes with nudity and it 's of the people standing around variety . No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!<br /><br />This movie is so inherently awful it 's difficult to know what to criticise first . The dialogue is awful and straight out of the Troma locker . At least Troma is tongue in cheek though . This is straight - faced boredom personified . The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin ( Flora the possessed kid in The Innocents would you believe ! ) the worst with her high - pitched screechy voice . Welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque . The other female lead has a creepy face so I do n't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film ! And the doctor is pretty bad too . He also looks worringly like Gene Wilder.<br /><br />It is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy . This is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that . Only the lighting is OK . The sound is also dreadful and it 's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up . The ' ghost ' mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.<br /><br />Really this film ( the witching at least ) is only for the unwary . It ca n't have many sane fans as it 's pretty unwatchable and I actually found it mind - numbingly dull ! < br /><br />The best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie LIKE THE PLAGUE !
0 The only previous Gordon film I had watched was the kiddie adventure THE MAGIC SWORD ( 1962 ) , though I followed this soon after with EMPIRE OF THE ANTS ( 1977 ) ; he seems to be best remembered , however , for his sci - fi work of the 1950s.<br /><br />Anyway , I happened upon this one in a DVD rental shop : had n't I noticed Orson Welles ' unmistakable figure on the sleeve , I probably would n't even have bothered with it – since I know the film under its original title , NECROMANCY ! I 'd seen a still from it on an old horror tome of my father 's : the actor 's presence in a film about diabolism seemed like a great idea which could n't possibly miss , but the end result – particularly in this bastardized edition – is a disaster ! I honestly felt sorry for Welles who looks bored and , rather than in his deep and commanding voice , he mutters the inane demonic invocations almost in whispers ! ! < br /><br />The plot is , basically , yet another retread of ROSEMARY 'S BABY ( 1968 ) : a couple is invited to a remote community under false pretenses and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by diabolists . The girl , played by Pamela Franklin , ostensibly has supernatural powers ( passed on from her mother , who appears intermittently throughout to warn her – though , as delivered in an intense manner through clenched teeth , the latter 's speeches end up being largely incoherent and the fount of immense hilarity every time she appears ! ) and is expected to revive Welles ' deceased young son from the dead ! ! For what it 's worth , Franklin – a genre regular , right down from her debut performance in THE INNOCENTS ( 1961 ) – is n't bad in her role ( which requires some nudity and experiences several semi - eerie hallucinations during the course of the film ) ; hubby Michael Ontkean , however , is n't up to the challenge of his John Cassavetes - like character . Some of the other girls look good as well – notably Lee Purcell , whose belated decision to help Franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her undoing.<br /><br />Events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax , which sees the Satanists ultimately turning on Franklin and have her take the revived boy 's place in the coffin ( that 's gratitude for you ! ) . While the added scenes do stick out ( the hilarious opening ceremony and other would - be erotic embellishments ) , the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them ; then again , this particular version is further sunk by the tacked - on electronic score – which is wholly inappropriate , and cheesy in the extreme !
0 I 've given up trying to figure out what version of this I 'm watching . The copyright at the end indicates 1983 . And though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film , I will say that watching a film obviously made in the Aquarian Age ( including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons ) but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling . Extremely unsettling.<br /><br />My main objection here is HOW DARE THE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE - AS - A - BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE . HOW DARE THEY.<br /><br />Seriously she 's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies I 've seen her in - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill her off.<br /><br />I would like to put the film industry on notice . Pamela Franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off I SHALL ASK HIM TO STEP OUTSIDE.<br /><br />NO ONE BEATS UP ON PAMELA FRANKLIN AND GETS AWAY WITH IT . I AM QUITE CROSS . THE FURY HAS BEEN UNLEASHED.<br /><br />For B - movie fans seeking out a crapfest , you could do much worse than this . On the plus side , this is not a film which involves Satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this movie is a hardcore satanic film.<br /><br />Wall - to - wall satanic ceremonies , baphomets , hallucinations , a ludicrous rat attack - what else could you ask for.<br /><br />This excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted - on 1980s synth soundtrack , which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be . The soundtrack reminded me of something you 'd hear on The Equalizer . It 's really bad.<br /><br />Also , they made Pamela Franklin squash her charming English accent , which was also quite rude , if not a cruel atrocity ( against the viewer ) such as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . I say that we have a right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice . Who 's with me ? I could forgive everything else about this film if they did n't abuse Pamela Franklin . And so I throw the gauntlet down , sirs -- ANYONE WHO MESSES WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES WITH ME.<br /><br />EVEN IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT.<br /><br />GOOD DAY , SIRS .
0 I figured that any horror film with Orson Welles in it would be weird . Necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it 's own good . The film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists / witches in a small town and a young woman 's attempt to escape them . The director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences . By the finale , there are too many unanswered questions . What 's worse , as the story is so confusing , it 's pretty hard to root for any of the characters . It seems odd that Welles would agree to headline this film especially since he does n't have that much to do . Maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie . Now that would really be fun !
0 I watched the Canadian videotape of this movie as " The Witching " which somehow made its way to New York State . Audio was quite bad , I had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog . Orson Welles was a mumbler , worse than usual , and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber . A ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted . Some closed captions would really have helped!<br /><br />A group of witches or satanists ( the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group ! ) have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll . The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named " Lilith , " where he 's been offered a job at a toy factory . Despite one of the AKAs of this movie apparently being " The Toy Factory , " we never see it , and it 's only occasionally referred to at all.<br /><br />On the way to Lilith , her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion . He drives aggressively , and causes another car to go off the road and blow up . After the police arrive , she takes a doll that fell out of the car , the second of many handmade dolls in the movie.<br /><br />It turns out Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches , and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage , though she does n't realize it . They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy , of which she was not really aware.<br /><br />Some images in the movie have some impact , but on the whole the movie is not very involving . The movie does seem a bit of a mess , and this is no doubt largely due to its re- editing and the addition of new footage . The original version , according to the end credits , was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life . The magic of DVD could let us see both versions on one disc , but re - releasing this movie probably is n't a priority .
0 For starters and for the record , the term " Necromancy " describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does NOT , in any way , relate to having sex with cadavers . That is called necrophilia and , yes , I know it 's an obvious difference but I 'm already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that I sport a perverted taste in movies ! This movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy , in fact , and merely just qualifies as boring , inept and terribly bad . " Necromancy " makes at least one top five ranking , namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made ! Now , director Bert I. Gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces ( on his repertoire there are titles like " Earth vs. the Spider " , " King Dinosaur " and " Food of the Gods " ) but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless , redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns . Shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead , Lori and her husband Frank move to the quiet little town of Lillith , where Frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory . Lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity , especially with the town 's patriarch and " owner " Mr. Cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious . That 's another thing . How can anybody " own " a town and everybody in it ? Either way , Lori gradually discovers that everybody in Lillith is a witch and Mr. Cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead . Since many years already , Cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he 's prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes . I honestly do n't see the point of the whole movie . It 's a blatant rip - off of " Rosemary 's Baby "  one of the alternate titles even is " Rosemary 's Disciples "  but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief . Why is n't anyone allowed to have children for as long as Cato 's son remains dead ? That 's just really selfish ! When , where and how did Lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead ? " Necromancy " definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments , but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget . The grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy . Orson Welles ' performance  undoubtedly the low point of his career  is pitiable , and still it 's the best aspect about the entire movie .
0 When a film has no fewer than FIVE different titles , it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere . Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad . I saw the version on video called Rosemary 's Disciples . Yes , I am sure it differs from other versions , but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have - going to be really any better . The story is perhaps the biggest problem : the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists(yep , it gets bad this early ! ) . The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the " owner " of the town are allowed in . Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr. Cato - the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back(hence the name Necromancy ) . The people in the town do witch kind of stuff - have ceremonies , some like wearing a goat 's head , and promiscuity abounds(not much really shown in this area ) , but none of these people are very good actors . Mr. Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger - than - life movie maverick Orson Welles . Welles is misused , but , make no mistake , he is the best thing in this movie . And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance . In one scene at a party , director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames ! It looked ridiculous . As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman 's arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash . It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin . The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens : many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed . This also applies to the corny , hokey ending . The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent . Other than her performance , real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles . The direction and story were both done by Gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine . This is not a good movie in any way under any name .
0 Ok , I 've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird . This movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role ( could n't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a Satanist ) he just did not belong in this movie at all . But anyhow , the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage . The lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called Lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die . The couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends . Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears ( that was creepy ) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life . The lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it 's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about . This movie is ok , it 's has it 's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have Orson in there .
0 " Ambushed " is no ordinary action flick . It 's much to bad to be ordinary . One man walks toward another with a machine gun blazing . The other man fires one round and fells the man with the greater fire power without so much as a nick from the hail of lead raining down on him . Guess which one is the good guy . Duh . Such is " Ambushed " through and through . Not a good action flick , not a good drama , not a good movie , " Ambushed " fails on all levels with it 's cast of B - movie veterans mechanically going through the motions almost as though they know they 're making a real loser . Not recommended for anyone.<br /><br / >
0 I do n't know what it is with these Brady kids . First , Barry Williams publicly brags about having sexy with his TV sister , Maureen McCormick , then about dating his TV mom , Florence Hederson . Then , Susan ( Cindy ) Olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies . Then Mike ( Bobby ) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving . Finally , Maureen ( Marcia ) McCormick and Eve ( Jan ) Plum might have had a little same - sex fling on the side . Now , Christopher ( Peter ) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early-20s during his stint on " The Surreal Life " , which at first was fun to watch , and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship . The last episode , where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to Christopher for his birthday , was not a good move on her part . And he dealt with it in a very mature fashion , just picking up and leaving to clear his head . I think he was always bowing to her every need and now he 's finally taking a stand . And I hate to say it , but I think she abuses him , verbally . The way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing . Also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men , which is not something any self - respecting human being should do when already married to someone . If this were a man talking down to his wife like that , and going out every night partying and having sex with other people , everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him . Why should this be any different . What started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster . Adrianne , as beautiful as she is , is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan , clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things . I feel sorry for her , but Chris needs to rid himself of her , because he is a good man who can not afford to be humiliated like this .
0 I loved Adrianne Curry before this show . I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won . I also liked Chris Knight , he seems like a great guy . But this show just made me SICK ! I 'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show . I do n't care that they were different ages , I know age ca n't stand between love . But Adrianne , you had been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS . It did n't surprise me at all that he had n't proposed . And I do n't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they 're ready . If it 's meant to be , then why not just ENJOY each other 's company and love each other , and let it come naturally ? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary , it 's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you , with or without a ring . And Chris , shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway ! You 've been through two failed marriages , how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit ? I hope the relationship lasts , but I really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons . Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage .
0 I do not watch much television and came across this show . Reality show ? I sure hope this is not for real . If I was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty , It would be grounds for divorce . I think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love . That is one thing that is wrong with our world now , so many people in bad relationships , selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another . It is self sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt . That does not give one a very good feeling , to watch what should be in private counseling . If his personality on the show is for real , then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is . Is this show a reality or made up for ratings ? ? ? ? I really would like to know . Sincerely , GB
0 Adrianne , should really get a life - without Mr. " Brady " . She nauseates me , and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show . It 's pretty brainless show , and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death . This makes them look / sound they are anything but ready for marriage , and yet , I know these disagreements are all part of life . I guess to some people this is entertainment . If this happens to fall into next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash . Though I would not be terribly surprised . ca n't even stand the commercials for this show anymore ! I hope they 're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week . However , the " A " girl has one heck of great butt !
0 I give this marriage 3 years and that s stretching it . Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth , spoiled , controlling , loud , and her bi sexual past makes me laugh . She tells Chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs . He married her . Chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp . I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination is not gon na have a happy ever after ending . Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth . Here 2 very good people who are gon na end up in a nasty divorce . I do n't think his old " Brady Family " is gon na fit into his new life . I see them being shut out . Chris said his friends were more important than his family . The supported him and was there for him .
0 I really wanted to like this movie . It has a nice prison setting , conspiracy theories , bloodthirsty zombies , a perfectly hideous 80s - touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon , who also plays a bad ( you guessed it ) a bad guy . It reminds me of some ( beloved ) Italian horror flicks . But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish / frightening moment in there . It just goes on and on and on , and then it ( logically ) has to end . More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed .
0 If you made a genre flick in the late 80s , you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison ( sadly , we never got an underwater prison flick ) . Framed for murder by mafia boss Moretti ( Anthony Franciosa ) , Derek Keillor ( Dennis Cole ) ends up on death row , right alongside the mob boss ' brother Frankie ( Frank Sarcinello Jr. ) . But this is the least of Derek 's problems as rogue government agent ( and mob stoolie ) Col . Burgess ( John Saxon , who also directs ) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus . This is the only flick Saxon directed during his storied career . For a guy who has worked with tons of directors , it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap - o Italian ones . Sure , it is low budget , but that ca n't excuse the stilted staging , shooting gaffes , or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes . To his credit , Saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene ( our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist ) . Cole , who looks like a more rugged Jan - Michael Vincent , is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the cliché mob boss . The end takes place at Marty McKee 's favorite location , Bronson Canyon . Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE .
0 I myself am a big fan of low - budget 80 's horror films . This is n't the worst but still not to spectacular . The plot line is decent but drags out way too long . You 're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action . The kills are n't very creative and the zombies are n't too crafty . I truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick . It 's watchable but I feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life . I 'll give the film credit for being somewhat original . If you are really into B horror movies it 's worth a viewing but if you 're not , do n't bother . But you do n't have to take my word for it .
0 * Contains some spoilers * This movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness . The plot takes way too long to get off the ground , never steadies itself , and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film . There are a few gem moments for zombie fans , but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror.<br /><br />The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance . First , there 's a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs . The hero of the movie is an ex - Vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob . The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail . In this jail , they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior . But the badie psychotic head scientist / military guy has other plans in mind . He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make .... da da da .... super soldiers ! After some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine , the military / crazy scientist guy goes " hey this might be a problem " and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra - empowered independent woman character , who of course invented the original serum . She goes to the prison to see what 's going down , the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison , and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out . The hero guy and the scientist / journalist lady team up to find a cure , save the warden 's kids , and deal with some irate prisoners , both infected and not . Meanwhile , the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother . The military gets ready to blow the place up , and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out.<br /><br />There are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars . There 's also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner . Still , the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film , when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner.<br /><br />The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end . The hero , woman , and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route . Their path leads them to a long hallway , on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars . Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through , gracing their hair and faces as they pass by . There 's also a few good scenes of the classic " couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies " and " many zombies ripping one guy to shreds " bits.<br /><br />Overall , worth watching if you 're researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichés worth noting ; it 's practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie . But if you 're new to zombie flicks and want a real scare , you should look elsewhere .
0 After mob boss Vic Moretti ( late great Anthony Franciosa ) kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with Derek , their new chauffeur/ Vietnam vet , and blames it on the poor guy , Derek finds himself in jail where he has to contend with a corrupt warden , Vic 's prisoner brother who runs the jail , and , oh yeah illegal experiments conducted by a shady CIA agent ( great genre - mainstay and first time director John Saxon ) to turn various prisoners into super - human invincible zombies . Of course things get out of hand and it 's up to Derek , and the rest of the unchanged prisoners , to save the day after the infected ones take the jail over.<br /><br />John Saxon is a great talented actor & as a director Saxon is a ... great talented actor . To say this movie ( John 's sole directorial outing to date ) lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement . However , the film is n't totally without merit . The dialog , while idiotic , is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes . Sadly , this is n't really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into it 's own ( which is fairly late in the movie ) . As such , the most I can recommend this film is to say that if you 're a fan of Saxon ( which I indeed am ) , it 's worth one watch , just go in with low expectations and you should be fine.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure get topless < br /><br />My Grade : D+
0 I love John Saxon in anything he 's in . The one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled " Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called : Zombie Death House " . The $ 1000 dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Ray 's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70 's cheese legend . Ray being the front man at RetroMedia . Ray by the way makes Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon . Just plain bad now , the both of them- and boring besides . It 's great that Ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it 's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of Zombie Death House- ( the word " Zombie " sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of F.O.R. ) THE ONLY WAY TO DO SERVICE TO THIS TRIPE IS TO RELEASE IT ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OF SAXON ! ! ! If you wanna see real Saxon , pick up Black Christmas , Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove .
0 It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon ever directed , and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera . This movie is a dog , from start to finish , and it 's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it . A Viet Nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss , gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself & the war hero framed and sent to prison , death row , specifically . Now , this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine ( a zombie ) . Of course , everything goes wrong and then there 's all these infected people trapped in the prison , some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just do n't want to be there anymore . This just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself , and I stopped it before the end , which seemed like it was coming a few times but no , it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path . If one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves , so do n't risk it . 2 out of 10 .
0 Why watch this ? There is only one reason and that is for the greatness of John Saxon . I love his acting . My most favorite appearances by him are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 , and 7 as Nancy 's father a cop , Black Christmas as a cop , and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a cop . When I was rummaging through my local mall video outlet I came across the film Zombie Death House and I quickly tossed it back but before moving on I noticed that John Saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that I have ever heard of a director . This intrigued me ( Also the cheap $ 9.00 price tag ) and I and I had to have it . Upon coming home I realized that this film did not live up to Saxon 's other work even his acting , which may have been muddled by the added pressures of directing . But it was not just him the other actors sucked too . It seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act . The film even looks of 80 's porn quality . I can not in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers , but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80 's who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late , or a fan of crap films than this one is for . Also if you dig John Saxon as I do .
0 It 's been close to ten years since I 've seen either of the last two sequels to " Phantasm " - surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good . That being acknowledged to this day , I 'm still a huge fan of the first two installments so I thought I 'd go back and re - experience the ' final chapters ' . Part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that does n't make much sense ... Again , kicking off right where the previous movie left us , Reggie saves Mike from the Tall Man who vows to come back for him later , but things are n't safe for long when they come across Jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere . Apparently his soul is held prisoner by the Tall Man so Mike is then dragged into the sinister double - pronged Netherworld and Reg has to find him ... Along the way , he meets up with a ten year - old kid and a nun - chuck wielding black chick named Rocky who assist him throughout his journey.<br /><br />There 's really nothing memorable about " Phantasm III " other than how stupid and forcefully " humorous " it tries to be . Only one positive aspect that did n't even help the movie and that was the return of A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic . The problem is , they pretty much make cameo appearances ... Reggie Banister is of course back in his starring role , but his bumbling , love - sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like . Angus Scrimm also just did n't seem entirely " into " his role . He talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the " quirkiness " that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to . Most people 's opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think " it 's still entertaining " . Maybe I 'm just too much of a nit picker but I just could n't get into this one . I remember disliking it when I was a kid and after re - watching it - I can safely say - nothing has changed . Don Coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low - budget , nightmarish , legendary film " Phantasm " , which I still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and GORY , but " Lord of the Dead " ( stupid title ) just looked too rushed and slapped together to me ... The inclusion of the two new characters , Tim and Rocky ( the only thing missing was Scrappy Doo ! ! ) , was a strong indication of Coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise ... <br /><br />So , it 's a " Phantasm " movie with very little gore , nudity , and quadruple - barrel shot guns . Need I say more ?
0 Phantasm .... Class . Phantasm II ..... awesome . Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible.<br /><br />Even though i would love to stick up for this film , i quite simply ca n't . The movie seems to have " sold out " . First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start ( something the others did not ) . Also too many pointless characters , prime examples the kid ( who is a crack shot , funny initially but soon you want him dead ) , the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls ( erm not gon na work , or rather should n't ) and the blooming zombies ( what the hell are they doing there , there no link to them in the other Phatasms ) . Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.<br /><br />The only good bits are the cracking start and , of course , Reggie B.<br /><br />(Possible SPOILER coming Up)<br /><br />To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.<br /><br />Overall very , VERY disappointing . 3 / 10
0 * spoliers * do not read any further if you have n't seen this movie < br /><br />Picking up after the depressing " Phantasm II " ended ; The Tall Man kidnaps Mike , while Reggie and new kid Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back , and not end up as slaves on the Tall Man 's " Red Planet " . This one gets really silly : the trio of thieves in the bright pink hearse were only there for comic relief , and the black karate chick ( ca n't remember her name ) was so irritating I could n't wait to see if the Tall Man killed her character . This one sets it up to almost look like it was going to be Tim 's character , who comes in late and ultimately is the hero , but ... it does n't quite work out that way . By the very end of this story Liz is beheaded by the killer midgets , Mike gets a silver sphere implanted into his skull , the spheres get Reggie and the dwarfs get Tim , and there 's no one left to stop The Tall Man . The bad guy wins - now how 's that for a surprise twist at the end?<br /><br />This was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until ' 95 , and the ending of this one was at the time final , and although it 's disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a fitting and appropriate ending for this weird little series . But the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes , and an even worse and more nonsensical ending ... < br /><br />*1/2 out of * * * *
0 I loathed this film . The original Phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery . Like many 70s horror flicks , it looked and felt like some creepy , unfinished documentary . Phantasm II , from the late 80s , pumped up the action , but maintained this nice attention to mood . Sadly , Phantasm III is just awful . It tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films , which diminishes rather than expands their power . It shamelessly degrades imagery from the first Phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original . There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs . Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the draft . Did n't anyone-- the prop master , the DP , the editor , the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy ? Even worse , Phantasm III presents one corny , unfunny joke after another . How different from the intensity of the first film . The original Phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death . Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about Reggie 's horniness : several refer to the film 's " flying balls " ha - ha , oh , I get it , balls . Maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes , but they are on us .
0 " Phantasm " of 1979 was a highly atmospheric , creepy , scary and very original Horror flick , and , in one word , cult . The first sequel of 1988 was gory , witty , action - packed and highly entertaining . After the first sequel however , " Phantasm " creator Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas . " Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead " of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure , it even is quite entertaining , but there is no more originality , and the desperate attempts to bring in something new , are at times tiresome , which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors . < br /><br />- SPOILERS - < br /><br />Quite in the beginning , we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres ( the brain - sucking flying silver balls ) is unraveled . Thenceforward , a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters ( such as Tim , a " Home Alone "- style little kid who happens to be great at shooting , an Rocky , a tough and super - cool nunchaku - swinging black chick with a crew cut ) are introduced . The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony - tailed , guitar playing Reggie . Angus Scrimm is still quite creepy as the Tall Man , but the fact that the Tall Man talks a lot more in this film , makes him loose some of his creepiness . The character of Mike is played by A. Michael Baldwin again ( he had been replaced by James LeGros in Part 2 ) , which , in my opinion , does n't make much of a difference . The gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch , but it is still a disappointment , especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly.<br /><br />All things considered , " Phantasm III " is an acceptable time - waster , but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors . Fans of the first two " Phantasm " films can give it a try , but I recommend not to set your expectations too high .
0 In the third entry of the Phantasm series , Mike and Reggie continue chasing the Tall Man , assisted by a trigger - happy 9 year old , a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike 's deceased brother ( he died in the original Phantasm ) . Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel , since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II . I got the feeling the stress was merely laid on Reggie 's incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand - up comedian . The humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed , which fits a story like this better . Also , the settings are n't as macabre here , plus the constant presence of the Tall Man ( Agnus Schrim ) is n't as obvious   There still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time . By the way , beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off - screen . The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli , who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far  the fifth being in production . The first one is a semi - cult classic , the second is a horror - feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped . A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike , even though James LeGros portrayed his character a lot better in Phantasm II .
0 This entry is certainly interesting for series fans ( like myself ) , but yet it is mostly incomprehensible . The plot is confusing , as is the sequel continuity . Some striking effects , to be sure , but we never find out what it all really means.<br /><br />Try to see the " NC-17 " workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re - rated " R " .
0 I despise horror movies , that is no secret . No plot , bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these mistakes of cinema , and this " movie " is no exception . I can not believe some cable stations actually run this garbage . ( This particular garbage was released straight - to - video , as I recall . ) As mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie , I say this : All of the Phantasm movies , all of the Jason movies , Freddy movies , Chucky movies , and most of the Michael Myers movies can be summed up in one word : TERRIBLE!!!<br /><br />Rating ( Phantasm III ) : 0.5/10
0 So much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it 's hard to know where to begin.<br /><br />First of all , it 's a remarkably un - scary scary movie , even by Amercian standards . The dialogue is cliché , the characters are two - dimensional , the writing is ho - hum , and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting.<br /><br />We meet the following stereotypes in order : Balding Loser Guy ( probably divorced , but who knows ? This movie does n't tell us ) with a brave heart , the Young Hero ( who does n't do anything heroic at all ) , Brave Little Kid ( with a homicidal streak a mile wide ) and Black Bad - Ass Bitch ( with more brawn than brains ) . These guys take up an ongoing fight with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks.<br /><br />Oh , and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people . Given a chance , they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen't have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them . Booh ! Actually , one of them is haunted by a good ghost ( but then again , it might be a deceitful spectre ) who seems intent on helping our Brave Contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend.<br /><br />There is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters . It starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie , but this does n't explain a lot . If you 've seen the first two movies , fine . Otherwise you do n't know who these people are , how they are related , why they are n't in school or at work , or why you should care whether they live or die . Consequently , you do n't . The only point of interest becomes any splatter effects . And there are n't enough of those to keep you awake.<br /><br />Of potenial interest / amusement are the three Raider Punks , as stupid as they are evil , who menace Our Heroes . But they do n't get much screen time . They are offed almost immediately . Then they are buried ( why anybody should take the time is beyond me ) , then they appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies . Only to be offed again , literally within a minute.<br /><br />The rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of Caspar the Friendly Ghost appearing and disappearing , driving around looking for places , and Balding Loser trying to score som Bad Black Bitch Booty , using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager . No dice there ; not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie , so good thing there never is any.<br /><br />The head baddie , called the Tall Man , does n't manage to scare anyone older than 3 years ; howling " Booooy ! " every five minutes is n't enough . Why he , with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper - body strength , does n't simply squash our heroes like bugs is n't explained . Instead , he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions , who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell.<br /><br />Filmgoers who like masterpieces like " Friday 13th part XXXXVIII : Jason goes to college " might find some entertainment . The rest of us , who have developed pubic hair , will be bored out of our skulls .
0 Beautiful attracts excellent idea , but ruined with a bad selection of the actors . The main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers . Apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring . First , it considers it illogical behavior . No one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves . It all represents a typical Halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence . Does such a scenario , or the casting director and destroy this question is on Halmark producers . Cat is the main character is wonderful . The main character behaves according to his friend selfish .
0 This is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching . The plot could be a lot " thicker " than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type movie.<br /><br />The acting leaves something to be desired , though you can not quite place your finger on what it is.<br /><br />This is one of those that you watch on late night TV , perhaps on USA , simply because you can not get to sleep . Watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it .
0 1st watched 12/24/2009  4 out of 10 ( Dir - Robert Ellis Miller ) : Emotional Christmas fluff that does n't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual - based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen for them . The three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to Washington D.C. to enlist the then President of the United States , Herbert Hoover . This trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer , which makes the story kind of like a Disney " animals on the run " movie and does n't quite fit here . At the ending , there is n't any details given as to how the President helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie , in my opinion . The movie does eventually bring tears , but it takes too long to get to this . The movie is n't supposed to have been an original TV movie(according to IMDb ) but it has the obvious fade - outs that make it look this way  so I 'm not sure their information is accurate . All in all , this is a simple movie(that could have been more complex ) with a happy Christmas - like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance .
0 This might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made . The writers and producers should study the German films of the thirties and forties . They knew how to sell . Even soviet - style clunky leader as god - like father - figure were better done . Disappointing . The loss of faith , regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be " saved " by the Hoover / God was not too bad . Unfortunately , it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough . A few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical Hoover up in the corner of the screen - beaming and nodding- would have added a lot . The best aspect is Hoover only saving the deserving family and children WHO had " proven " their worth . Unfortunately , other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the Hoover - God does n't help them . A better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition . Finally , bright and cheerful scenes of recovery ( after Hoover saved the country from the depression ) should have rolled at the end . We could see then how Hoover - God had saved not just THIS deserving family , but all the truly deserving . Amateurist at best .
0 I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever watched . I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5 . I did used to like this show when I was 4 and 5 , I still only watched it when there was nothing on . Now I am other 5 and I would rather do my homework than watch it . The cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing . Now I am older I am interested in show witch are not rated Us . I have started to watch Doctor Who ( 12A ) , Torchwood ( 15 ) and Sarah Jane Adventures ( PG ) . I am interested in things to do with Doctor Who so I am not interested in 5 year old cartoons . This cartoon did n't last very long it only had 6 seasons , it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons .
0 In 2004 , I liked it . Then it became very stupid . It suggests that kids are brainless . It insults children . Cartoon Network used to be great . One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro . It did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming . The show ( Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends ) is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your Sprite . It seems as if today 's television producers are only interested in making money , rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money ! Lately , my children are tuning in to the old shows ( 60 's ) to find something interesting to watch . Perhaps , in the absence of originality , for television to look to its past and recycle children 's programing from days gone by .
0 This is the worst show I have seen in years . I believe that it should be taken off of T.V. because of its retardedness . It is so dumb I could faint when I watch it . ( even though I never watch it because it is SOOOOO poor ) < br /><br />Goofs : When mac says he can;t eat sugar , in another episode he eats sugar . Almost everything in the world has sugar in it ! ! ! In episode " Eddie Monster " when eddy screams at Terrance he falls into the crate twice PLUS the seconed time he falls in he does n't fall in , he falls off to the side . What stupidity . I ca n't even say the word Fosters Home . I even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is . Byyyyyyyyeeeee
0 The idea behind this film was a good one . Too bad it was n't written well . Casting Sidney Poitier as the FBI agent was a good idea , and he did an outstanding job . Tom Berenger , on the other hand , only knows one emotion in most of his movies , anger . Kirstie Alley 's character could have been a great one , and even showed some possibilities once , but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female . This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be . I do n't care for Alley 's acting anyway . The movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did . The director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action . I will keep this in my collection only as an example of Poitier 's performances .
0 I had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is Sidney Poitier 's best movie . Poitier had just returned from over a decade 's break in film acting and he is clearly creaky here . 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and they do n't include this . 5 of his films are on the AFI 's list of top 100 inspiring movies , again , not including this . Berenger and Poitier , rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to Canada . Some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and Berenger and Poitier 's bonding was cringeworthy and awkward ( not helped by a completely bland script ) . Kirstie Alley ( as the hostage ) was underused , and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen . Some attempt at suspense is made , for example when you 're meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer ( all of them are type - cast villains ) . I understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there . I guessed who it was and I was n't really trying hard.<br /><br />If you 're a Berenger fan , watch the Sniper ( 1993 ) , you even get to see Billy Zane strutting his stuff . It 's much better . All in all I 'd give Shoot to Kill 3/10 . It 's not daring , and it 's just too straightforward for me .
0 What a complete waste of time . The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series , but with even worse acting . Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible . The ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists , not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending . I liked some of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end . It just does n't happen . It 's a total " Wrestler " ending with none of the good acting . I ca n't believe I spent the time watching this . It 's not " fun " as some people put it . A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out . The connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first .
0 I 'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw - type movie or 12 Angry Men ( people piecing together the facts to get at the truth ) . Whatever it was , it was poorly done and not worth watching.<br /><br />I do n't watch movies for blood and gore , but because this film had little else going for it , it should have shown the actual killing more . Most were off - camera , minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths.<br /><br />It also bugged me that the cop was among the victims ; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence ( given to him by MJH ) into the evidence room . ( And would n't MJH a the prosecuting attorney , have had access to that evidence -- taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back -- anyway , so she would n't have needed the cop 's help ? ) . The others , while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming , still played larger roles in his ultimate demise . The gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent . The insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need , etc . But the cop 's crime seemed minor in comparison since he did n't know exactly what he was doing . The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged MJH to plant the evidence , which would have made him more culpable . And MJH 's yelling that he ( the cop ) got her in that mess does n't make any sense at all.<br /><br />It would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he / she was there and deserved to die . The insurance guy , for example , could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them ; the Oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness , etc . Yes , more violent that the gun deaths , but more interesting.<br /><br />The dialog was n't witty , there were no twists , and the ending was one of the worse ( if not the worst ) I 've ever seen . The ending along knocked three stars off my rating.<br /><br />The actors did a decent job , especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with.<br /><br />Overall , a waste of time .
0 an very good storyline , good thrill to it ... but the 10 last seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened ? extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry to say but a 1 in vote ... that s what it it deserve , i would think that Chris Shadley could come up with a better end ... but maybe next time : ) all this meaningless blood gore for nothing ? the end would lift the story to close to a 10 , but it did n't .... the end destroyed the whole story , i think most people are n't lame and when they goes a movie thy want a good end , even if it is intricate ... but the only lame here is the end ... sorry
0 Before watching this film , I could already tell it was a complete copy of Saw ( complete with the shack - like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs ) . MJH 's name on a movie would typically turn me away ( ugh , can we say GROSS ? ! ) , but I still wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />Starting out , I was a bit interested . The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters ( especially the man that played " Sulley " ) . MJH was even worst , but I continued to watch.<br /><br />However , the ending was the biggest joke of them all ! I seriously sat in shock thinking " THAT was the ending ? ! Is this a comedy?!".<br /><br />I thought this pile of crap was funnier than the " Scary Movie " spoofs and that is REALLY saying something !
0 Do n't waste your time on this film . It could have been good , but the ending was one of the lamest I 've ever seen . I seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could 've looked at that final scene and thought , " yeah ! now there 's an ending ! " and patted themselves on the back about it . To me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas ! They built up the final scenes to have a cool twist , but instead just let the whole build - up fall flat on it 's face . When the last shot faded to black and I heard the credit music starting I was in shock - I could not believe what I was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending . The best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance . Seriously , I 'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room , look them in the face and say - WTF ? ? ! ! ! !
0 I wanted to like this film , yes its a SAW , blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films . If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good , not brilliant , but good film .... unfortunately those ingredients had gone off ! The acting was terrible , and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one ( hoods taken off ) , the remarks and one liners are just terrible , yes I know , bad writing .... but this is more than that , it was bad writing coupled with bad acting . Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film ..... <br /><br />Sorry , I m even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all.<br /><br />I will end with PLOT HOLES , PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES ! DISAPPOINTING !
0 Sadly it was misguided . This movie stunk from start to finish . It was hard to watch because I used to watch Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon . I LOVED her . Then the next thing I found she did a spread in Maxim and she was gorgeous ! I have n't really heard anything about her until I watched this movie on accident . I could n't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it . Everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship . Too bad .. I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie .
0 I stumbled upon Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking I could deal with an average movie . This movie however was slightly below average , yet watchable . The script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a B - level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good . The plot borders on that of Saw , teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more , but that is really where the comparison ends . Nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new . The main fault that I found in Nine dead , was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people wo n't see coming , in a bad way . Barring any spoilers I have seen the worse of bad movies and even they did n't end this poorly . Decent flick , bad acting and ending though ...
0 I watched this movie as I liked the plot , a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they 're connected.<br /><br />The setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first ( and best ) Saw movie & although there was n't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace.<br /><br />There was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering ' Alpha males ' and it was a welcome surprise ( for me anyway)to see Melissa Joan Hart has n't given up on acting yet.<br /><br />A few things let it down for me personally ; 1 . The paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies.<br /><br />2 . MJH 's line about her cop ex ' getting her into this ' when in reality , he was the least deserving person to be there , he had n't KNOWINGLY contributed to the events leading up to their capture.<br /><br />3 . The ending ..... what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on ? There was no resolution , no cliff hanger , no obvious end ... it just ends.<br /><br />And for that alone I dropped two stars off my rating . The first 2 points I would let slide but not the end !
0 you can tell they spent 5 $ making this.it is a waste of your time ... ugh .. there is not anything remotely good about this movie ... .. i do n't know why i kept watching it .. the chick is not hot . horrid acting .. you could do anything and its a better use of your time .. like watching TV playing shitty video games .. i feel robbed . simply robbed .. of my time . i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on IMDb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments . -there was no action- -no hot chicks- -no budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- it screams bad movie . * * * * the WHOLE movie is in a room . * * *
0 While the original titillates the intellect , this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities . Instead of intricate plot - twists , this so - called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development . Worst of all , replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four - letter words , leaving behind a stark , but uninteresting taste.<br /><br />There was promise -- unfulfilled promise . The prospect of Michael Caine pulling off a Patty Duke - like Keller - to - Sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing . Unfortunately , this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation , first by accepting the role in this horribly re - scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to Jude Law 's amateurish overacting.<br /><br />If you have n't seen the classic original , overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks . Hunt it down , watch it , and just enjoy a story - and - a - half . As for the remake , pass on this insult to the original .
0 86 wasted minutes of my life . I fell asleep the first time I attempted watching it , and I must say I 'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema.<br /><br />I have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner , and can only surmise that the actors were as hard - up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.<br /><br />Everything in this dire adaptation is overacted . And if it is n't the wooden acting , almost as though you can see the teleprompter , then the set itself , which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways , and overdressed to an unimaginable extent , is enough to put you off the entire farce.<br /><br />As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise , any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance , should check their eyesight immediately.<br /><br />Bad acting , and from two very decent actors , coupled with the hyper - coddled Branagh trademark overdirection , is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.<br /><br />On top of it all , there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this , heightened towards the end of it . All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people sha n't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again .
0 The main reason for writing this review is I found this " revisioning " of a great play and worthy 1972 film , a horrible movie experience . If I can save someone from watching it , I will have done a good thing.<br /><br />This " new " version is loaded with talent , and it all goes wrong . Kenneth Branagh OKs an ugly , sterile , one note set . He proceeds to film the movie from every arty , distracting , self - centered angle possible . We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel , on security monitors , shots of their heads from 200 ft above , close ups of eyes , chins , and on and on . The screenplay , by a Nobel Laureate , introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter , that is being faked by both parties , .... I think ? ? Given the character " twists " how would I know ? The characters themselves , so richly drawn in the original , are crass and unsympathetic . The running time has been cut by an hour , which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the Director did for us . The actors perform their lines effectively , but nothing they say or do is remotely believable . Jude Law is over the top more than Caine , but as the credited Producer , must have had Branagh 's blessing.<br /><br />All in all I found this to be an ugly to look at , unconvincing shell of a former classic . Why was it even made ? ? ? The paying public spent less that $ 4 M worldwide to see it ! A vanity piece of work that fails at every turn .
0 I saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand . The plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing . The movie did n't have the " battle of wits " feel to me . The actors just spewed out mouthful 's of nonsense , at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on . The plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end ( I 'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach ) , even the ending was predictable . And you could tell the detective was Jude Law in a costume , everything from the fake accent , terrible dental work , costume shop facial hair , everything pointed to it being a disguise . The whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life . This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show , really boooring in my opinion .
0 Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer 's classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways . The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine . Caine has the Olivier role in this version and he 's paired with Jude Law . Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh.<br /><br />The acting is spectacular . Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles . I really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities . It 's wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the script 's direction goes haywire.<br /><br />Harold Pinter 's dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play ( which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like).The problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful . Michale Caine walks Law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason . Conversations happen repeatedly in different locations . I know Pinter has done that in his plays , but in this case it becomes tedious . Why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that Law is sleeping with Caine 's wife ? It would be okay if at some point Law said enough we 've done this , but he does n't he acts as if each time is the first time . The script also does n't move Caine through his manipulation of Law all that well . To begin with he 's blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us.(Never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered ) In the original we never suspected what was up . here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why Law 's Milo does n't see he 's being set up . There are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much.<br /><br />Thinking about the film in retrospect I think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps . The opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between Caine and Law . Missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller . Instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that does n't let them be real.<br /><br />despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just does n't work
0 This reworking of Anthony Shaffer 's classic play did not last long in cinemas . Having recently suffered through it on cable , I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket . Director Kenneth Branagh , writer Harold Pinter , and star / producer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes , without the fun or class of the longer original.<br /><br />Michael Caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film . He now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead , played in that version by Laurence Olivier . ( Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars , but lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER . ) Looking puffy and washed - out , Caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as Batman 's butler . He had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER . What 's next -- ALFIE II , or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING ? < br /><br />But then , no one benefits from this inane adaptation by Pinter , who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer 's witty character interplay . Branagh 's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that would n't hold up in a second - rate nightclub . Neither the shadows nor the tight , overacted close - ups can help Law overcome his dull screen persona . The result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller , almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.<br /><br />Fans of the original stage production ( with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter ) and the Olivier / Caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream . The late Mr Shaffer , who wrote the 1972 screenplay , as well as Hitchcock 's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations , must be turning in his grave , wishing he could plan a real murder or two !
0 At the name of Pinter , every knee shall bow - especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned , by - the - numbers , sixth - form anti - Americanism . But this is even worse ; not only is it a tour - de - force of talentlessness , a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades - old reputation , but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece . The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind . Yes , it was a theatrical confection , and it is easy to see how it 's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen , but it still worked terrifically well . This is a Michael Caine vanity piece , but let 's face it , Caine is no Olivier . Not only can he not fill Larry 's shoes , he could n't even fill his bathroom slippers . The appropriately - named Caine is , after all , a distinctly average actor , whose only real recommendation , like so many British actors , is their longevity in the business . He was a good Harry Palmer , excellent in Get Carter , but that 's yer lot , mate ! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original . This is more of a half - pinter .
0 Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's Sleuth did n't need a remake . It 's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day . However , given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing ; I really ca n't say I 'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience . The plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man , Milo Tindle , who goes off to see an older man , Andrew Wyke , to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man 's wife . From there , a game of cat and mouse ensues . Its clear right from the outset that director Kenneth Branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location , which has been changed from the charming games - ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment . I 'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original ; plus there 's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at . Unfortunately , however , the positive elements of Sleuth 2007 end there.<br /><br />The original film was over two hours long , while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes . Naturally , therefore , that means that this version has less about it ; and unfortunately it 's the characters that suffer . The plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place . The film does not build the characters , or the rapport between them , enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense . One major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession ; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be VERY important once the twists come into play . Here he has some kind of security fetish that does n't really mean anything by the end . Kenneth Branagh 's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there . The original thrived on it , but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous , and mostly unwarranted , occasions ; which cheapen the whole thing . The final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion . After spending two hours with the original I understood , respected and liked both characters presented in the film - after eighty minutes of this , I hated them both . I do have some respect for Branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film ; but this is not a good adaptation of the great Anthony Shaffer play .
0 It 's a while ago , that I have seen Sleuth ( 1972 ) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier . Michael Caine is back , but he is now the husband and Jude Law the lover of his wife . The story is still the same and it 's a fantastic play.<br /><br />During the movie I always had the feeling to watch a play . That 's one of the reasons I dislike this remake of a classic . When I watch a movie adapted a play I still must feel to see a movie and not just a play . Director Kenneth Brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past , but this time he missed . Another reason was the look of the movie . The design was modern , stylish clean , uncomfortable and cold . I never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house . The photography was n't bad , but the lightening was awful . Sometimes there was blue light , dark , green light , to round it up not friendly for eyes.<br /><br />The acting was really good . Michael Caine 's and Jude Law 's perform at their best . I really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage . But I have to confess I never was a fan of Jude Law . The weakest part was the mid part . I remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed . I tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part I felt asleep . The end part is better and more interesting . Sleuth ( 2007 ) is n't awful , but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience . Sleuth ( 1972 ) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth ( 2007 ) .
0 A remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play , nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie . But doing nothing else nicely at all.<br /><br />A under - parr performance from the actors , Law and Caine , diluted further by weak self - indulgent direction.<br /><br />The warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super - modern homesetting . The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine which made the first movie so watchable , is replaced with a horrid , brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer . But this is not the clever , to - ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well , this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both character from the word go.<br /><br />This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing , watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act .
0 I thought the film was good in parts.the start was exciting .the first 30 minutes of the film were good.the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely.<br /><br />i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films.<br /><br />the dialoques did not make sense and i do n't think they were very witty.<br /><br />i felt as if they were trying to copy films like phonebooth in terms of dialogues , but failed miserably.it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story.<br /><br />the entire film features only law and caine.<br /><br />i do n't think it was a waste of time , its an OK film , but not gr8
0 I loved the original . It was brilliant and always will be . Strangely though , I actually looked forward to seeing the re - make . I 'm usually a little bit against re - makes because there 's far too many of them , but somehow this intrigued me . I was really enjoying it to begin with . Caine brilliant , as usual , and Jude Law managing to hold is own next to him . It was quite clever how it was modernised and it was working . What stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes . It goes completely away from the original , so far in fact that is ceases to be clever and just gets annoying . The end in the original was fantastic ! So much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever ! This ? It grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make Caine 's character a homosexual . It was if they were trying far to hard to be different . And then ... BANG ! Law 's dead . Roll Credits . This film is worth the watch simply for the performances , but those last seven minutes really do drag it down . What a pity ....
0 Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the South Seas . The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie . The landscapes are beautiful , and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch . The film loses momentum , though , when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers . The storyline just never gets that interesting , despite being handled well by Murnau . Won an Academy Award for best cinematography , although the award probably should have been for best scenery . You ca n't really credit the DP for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location .
0 I heard many stories about this film being great ... Well , I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month.<br /><br />I watched it , and I have only a few comments about it:<br /><br />1 ) Terrible story - line , 2 ) Terrible acting , 3 ) Bad fighting - scenes ... <br /><br />I never seen any worse movie in my life so far ! ! When the storyline is bad , than at least make the fights something more interesting . But BOTH are done ridiculously bad ... <br /><br / > * The only positive thing about this movie ( in my opinion ) is Nikki Berwick . God , she looks nice in this movie.<br /><br />That 's about it ...
0 First of all when I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu , I was definitely excited . Brenda Song , one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel , would be doing martial arts and I was fine with that ... until I saw the movie . The action was poorly constructed , the movie could n't have realated to anyone , the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked ... along with the plot . If you really think about it 's a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer , a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women , a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen , the watcher who bug 's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil . The idea just was n't all that original , the movie is waste of time .
0 I 'd give it a 2/10.<br /><br />I was really , really disappointed.<br /><br />The storyline was poorly developed , for instance , the incidents were too short and brief , hence the moral was not clearly brought out . I thought Brenda Song did a fine job , but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role . I could see the need to put in western elements in the show , however , there are certain parts , where Chinese elements were needed too ! The villain for example . His physical appearance resembled a robot , instead of something out of the Chinese culture . The final and the worst flaw , were the incorrect , and distorted facts placed in the show.<br /><br />Others may point out that this is a ' Kid 's show ' and hence , there is no need for the such high standards . However , there are other Disney shows , such as Mu Lan , which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.<br /><br />In conclusion , I feel that Disney movies should be better researched and better planned . A good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on .
0 This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie . The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles , it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous . If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed , but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts ( which I might add are poorly done ) and wish you were some warrior to . The casting in this movie was n't very good , and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it did n't fit at all . On a scale of 1 - 10 ( 10 being excellent , 1 being horrible ) the acting in this movie is a 4 . Brenda Song is talented in comedy , but with this kind of movie , in some of the more serious scenes , her acting was laughable . When she made some of her " fighting " poses , I started laughing out loud . I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing , for example , the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing , how her voice turns dark and evil , I think that was incredibly stupid , and how Wendy 's ( Brenda Song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks , that was pretty ridiculous to . So to sumamrize it all , a disappointing movie , but okay if you 're 10 or under .
0 I thought the movie ( especially the plot ) needs a lot of work . The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie . I 'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:<br /><br />First , when Shen told Wendy that he would help her study the history of China , I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history ; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history ; yet instead , the movie only shows Wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied , which frustrated and put me in dismay.<br /><br />Second , which really bothered me , is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes . Yet they did n't really mention the real significance of it . The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival , which they did not explain or go in depth . They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady . The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising , but one day all ten suns rose up , drying up the land with the rising intense heat ; so the Divine Archer , Hou Yi , shot nine of the ten suns , leaving only one sun ( there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the eight out of nine suns ) . Because of his heroic contribution , he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again , but his wife , Chang - O stole it . After stealing it , she fled to the moon , where she met a hare . She then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth , giving everyone immortality . ( There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood , I , most of the time , heard about this version ) . I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented.<br /><br />The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie . The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra - cotta Warriors ( the life - like statues of the soldiers ) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese . The Terra - cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China 's past and it was very westernized ( where evil must be killed in anyway possible ) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection . It would be understandable if Wendy , considering she is Chinese - American and does n't have full Chinese knowledge , had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.<br /><br />The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight ... I mean , it 's rated TVPG due to violence , which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony . It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.<br /><br />All in all , all of or either of the producer , writer , or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead . I would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re - shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information ; however , I would give it credit ( 2 stars ) for removing one stereotype of Asians and Asian - Americans of being smart and quiet .
0 I thought this movie was terrible . I 'm Chinese , so I thought everything was totally wrong . Many of the facts were incorrect . The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy 's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi . I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake . Many of the actors and actresses were not very great . Some of the jokes that were supposedly " funny " were really stupid . I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get . Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie . Mulan was quite accurate . Watch this movie if you want to waste some time .
0 There are several things wrong with this movie- Brenda Song 's character being one of them . I do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- I honestly do n't . I believe she is given poor lines . She is just supposed to be , " that vain , rich girl " , and while it is funny in the TV shows she plays in , it ca n't even get a dry laugh from me here.<br /><br />Either way , I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this film.<br /><br />The movie was not that terrible ... initially . Wendy 's reaction to Shen was completely natural . I mean , how would you feel if a man , claiming to be a reincarnated monk , chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight " the great evil " and save the world ? Which brings me to another point . I know this movie is entirely fiction , but it is still has a founding in Chinese culture . It seems like all of the " warriors " in Wendy 's family line were women . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I doubt that the monks would 've just been okay with that . Sure , maybe they could 've worked it in somehow , but they offered no explanation whatsoever . By doing so , they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media.<br /><br />Nevermind that , however- let us continue.<br /><br />Wendy 's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on . Yes , she is a teenager , and it is near homecoming- I mean , who wants to fight evil during homecoming ? The problem is , when " the evil " starts to manifest himself , Wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be . She is extremely careless- even for someone like her . She continues not to care about her training . I will use this conversation as an example , Shen : " If you do not win this battle , evil will take over , and everything good will be gone . " Wendy : " Whoa , talk about pressure . Well ... let 's talk about something else . " Yes , let 's Wendy . Let 's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training . Of course Shen lets her , but his character has an excuse . Better that he cooperate with her , than that he not , and she not train at all , and get them both killed.<br /><br />Oh , speaking of which . Shen also told Wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle , as he had for her great - grandmother ( I am assuming that part).<br /><br />This makes Wendy 's actions more unforgivable.<br /><br />As the script - writer would have it , Wendy 's homecoming and this " great battle " are on exactly the same day . Do you know what Wendy does ? Do you even have to guess ? Yes , she does end up going to the battle , for when she tries to leave for homecoming , the monks , ( who Shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she " felt weird fighting an old man " ) inform her that Shen has gone to battle alone , so she goes to save him.<br /><br />We initially see some half - decent fighting , that is actually entertaining . Until finally , the great evil comes out of Wendy 's rival - for - homecoming 's body , and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.<br /><br />Don't ask.<br /><br />Anyway , Wendy gets all " panicky . " Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.<br /><br />Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.<br /><br />She screams title of said article out.<br /><br />Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful far , far too fast . No , I will not let it be excused because it was her " destiny " and she had " the power within " her.<br /><br />Since when , though , did she learn healing ? No , worst ... since when could she resurrect people ? So Shen is raised from the dead . Then , Wendy and he fight the guy.<br /><br />He loses way to easily . The worst part , is when they jump together , and kick him at the same time , and he is banished forever . Then the monks commend Wendy on her sacrifice.<br /><br />Two things , # 1 : Do n't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more " finesse " to it ? # 2 : What sacrifice ? The fact that she did n't go to homecoming ? Because the girl did not break a sweat , or even bleed . I mean , come on now , this movie was TV PG , I wanted to see somebody get hurt.<br /><br />Ah - hem ... moving on.<br /><br />I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie a one , based on my comments . Part of critique , you must know , though , is breaking a thing down . You do n't necessarily try to look for the bad , but if it 's there , you bring attention to it . This movie has a lot of bad , but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.<br /><br />So , I suppose it was all right . Not that me not saying it was n't all right would 've stopped anybody from watching it .
0 There is n't more I can say that saying this film was awful . The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell . But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just laughable . That is like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino , etc , etc . It just is n't believable.<br /><br />The story is flat out hideous . It talked about Shin being from a Monastery in China - later identifying it from Bejing . However , the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on Mongolia . I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own , granted . But its a distinct nation and it even labels " Mongolia " on the map . Did Disney Studios fail 5th Grade Geography ? < br /><br />The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best , and yet she somehow feels connected to him . Her training is just cheesy as well . And , lets cut to the chase : everything about this film is bad . Its bad enough to laugh at and cry over . The Taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.<br /><br />The evil eyes thing was cheesy . However , the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it . They should have left the evil eyes ending in it . But instead somehow evil is defeated . Yey ! < br /><br />Overall , not worth the time of the dog in the film . Brenda Song should get on with another studio . " F "
0 Worst DCOM I have seen . Ever . Well , maybe not as bad as Smart House . This was just bad . The acting and story was fine , but the effects SUCKED!<br /><br />They were so fake ! The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen . That was probably the only scene in which I was excited.<br /><br />Overall , I found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly . < br /><br />I will give it a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.<br /><br />4/10
0 I 'm here again in your local shopping mall ( of course , 'cause that 's where the high school kids hang out ! ! ! ! ! ) to demonstrate how awful " BENDY POO : PROM COURIER " really is ! ! ! ! ! To prove how bad this joke of a DCOM this is ... <br /><br /> ... we're going to take these four sumo wrestlers , and stuff them into this photo booth . How ... cozy ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />Hai ! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Uh ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />How awful is it ? ? ? ? ? It 's so bad , Disney Channel flushes away its money , yet again , with those exciting yet determining 10-second promos , keeping the viewers wondering , " WHEN IS THIS GOING TO BE ON ? ? ? ? ? " And then , suddenly , when it DOES come on , for one , this not only got a higher TV rating than usual , but this was only seen once ! ! ! ! ! Oh , no ! ! ! ! ! One time everyone ! ! ! ! ! Plus , this movie is about high school and stuff , and believe me , I will NOT go any further with what else is in there ..... <br /><br />Say ch ... smile ! ! ! ! ! ( SNAP ! ) < br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs . 0/10
0 Wow . This was probably the worst DCOM ever . I watched the first half hour and I laughed . Brenda Song plays Wendy , the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be Homecoming Queen . She is supposed to save the world as a warrior , and Shin comes to her aid to help her with her Martial Arts . Shin teaches her the skills of a snake , tiger , etc . and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world.<br /><br />This movie is great for kids who want to learn about Martial Arts and the Chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible.<br /><br />Brenda Song is a comedic actress and I ca n't see her playing a serious role . It was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over Shin . Shin could n't act at all , and everything was totally unbelievable.<br /><br />I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar , and the thing I came up with was the Power Rangers . This movie is so fake and the stunts were so Power Ranger - esquire that it was just corny and stupid . The characters were n't likable and I just could n't stand to watch it . Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies . High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel , along with other movies like Jumping Ship , Color of Friendship , Go Figure , Read It and Weep , & Stuck in the Suburbs.<br /><br />If you like action - adventure and corny jokes , you 'll like this movie .
0 Wendy Wu : Homecoming Warrior has a very good , strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie . I am a younger teenager and did n't enjoy this movie very much . I thought the effects were horrible , but they might seem entertaining to younger children . The matrix moves ruined the action , you know that it was absolutely fake . Then there was the Yen Lo , an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which Wendy was striving to win . It all ends like a typical feel good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo ( and destroy him forever ) in the end . So Wendy learns a lesson ... blah , blah , blah . I 'm ready for the next DCOM .
0 I am so insulted by this movie , it 's not even funny ... And I thought " Mulan " was unbelievable ! However low my expectations of Disney have become , I never figured they 'd do something so stereotypical yet so off . There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture , just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts.<br /><br />I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy into a normal teenage girl ... But , fortunately , most normal teenage girls -- particularly Asian teenage girls -- are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life . And from a cultural stand point , it 's almost impossible . Yes , there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion , but they 're pretty rare . And even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars . Another stereotype , maybe , but a fairly true one . Because that 's how Chinese parents work . That 's how Chinese values work . If they wanted to go for authenticity , they would 've made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love - hate relationship with her family.<br /><br />This just adds to my frustration with American movies . Asian culture is n't about meditation and vague , nature - oriented phrases that sound wise . We do n't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time , and we do n't all know some form of martial arts . We 're a PEOPLE , and I 'd appreciate it if someone would write an Asian part that does n't portray us as some sad caricature .
0 The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi 's fate as an assassin , fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.<br /><br />That 's as poetical as I 'll get when talking about Azumi 2 : Death or Love , because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood - driven assassin , after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.<br /><br />Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience . In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics ( which is their number one priority ) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape . But I wo n't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi 's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma . By the way , Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go , minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.<br /><br />This brings me to the final blow which is the action , simply disguised in the title as the ' Death ' side of the epic . In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons . To no one 's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily . In Azumi 1 , the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile . Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter . I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.<br /><br />The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.<br /><br />As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation , I wo n't lie and I 'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film , but I 'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2 , the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece . For what it 's worth , Azumi 2 : Death or Love could have gone straight to video , with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins , doing their best to restore the peace , with an unwavering courage to die trying .
0 I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga , compelling storyline , cool soundtrack , directing ( Kitamura rocks ! ) , editing , and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly . So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2 , but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket : ( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off , however these are completely 2 different movies . The pace is a lot slower , the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development . This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise ( if that is possible ! ) . I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity . If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment . There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off . Even the real bad guys , get killed off too easily without too much of a fight . The fight with the Spider guy ( straight out of an episode of Monkey ! ) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene . Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects , Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam ! ! Azumi 's rampage at the end was unconvincing , but Aya still does an okay job . She looks great in the cape ... but where did she get it from ? I do n't think i will be watching this one over and over again ! ... what a pity .
0 I loved the first " Azumi " movie . I 've seen Ms. Ueto in a variety of her TV appearances and I 've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks . I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I 'd expected.<br /><br />Given the movie 's cast and set up in " Azumi " , they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie , but instead it was slow , plodding in parts , and sprinkled with very poor , unconvincing , and wooden acting.<br /><br />When they bothered to reference the first movie , they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak . In " Azumi " , the title character is the best of a group of superior killers . In " Azumi 2 " she seems somehow diminished and less - impressive.<br /><br />That 's not to say it was a total loss . There were a few decent fight scenes and some over - the - top characters . Unfortunately , the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama . The latter two truly captured the " manga " feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite " got it . "
0 The movie deserves 2/10 . 1.5 stars for the girl , ( I 'm sorry I 'm biased , i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies ) , and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1 . I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating . I amazed myself being able to sit through it . < br /><br />Lets talk about the plus points of the movie . The girl . Ueto Aya is cute . That s all there is to salvage the whole movie . The fact is , if the main character was male , i am sure that most people ( including me ) would not have touched the movie at all . < br /><br />Now lets talk about the minus points . Firstly , it is real draggy , with lots and lots of repeated scenes . Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back . It seems more like a drama way of shooting . Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks , and this movie too . Secondly , the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting . I do not mind unrealistic movies . But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness , by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs , etc ... it reminds me of Shinobi , though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting . Moreover , to portray " i - don't - know " what effect , the director films people dying with blood spraying ( literally ) all around ... people not realizing their head was cut off ... etc .. etc ... etc ... Too many of these spoils the show . It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie . It degrades the show greatly . Thirdly , Is n't Azumi supposed to be an assassin . She seems more like an one - man - army to me , just that she is a female . I do n't think you see assassins charging into army camps . The only time i felt she acted " assassin - liked " was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1 . Lastly , the plot was thin in both movies . Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way .
0 One of the worst movies I 've seen shoddy camera work , crappy filter usage , film was grainy , script was terrible , i mean come on , how predictable was the big battle at the end ..... <br /><br />some of the fight scenes were okay i guess .... <br /><br />some scenes were so bad it was comical ... like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end ... LOL i mean really .. a horse ? Oh ca nt forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie .. one would think that after killling key witness and federal agents , they woulda been tracked down .. ETC , ETC really do n't bother watching it ...
0 I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick , but this is just bad . And not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3 K make fun of it . It 's just nauseatingly bad like you ca n't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try . I truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap . You can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers . Apparently " Walking Tall " has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment . If it 's not the worst film I 've seen , it 's so bad that it 's blotted the worse films from my memory .
0 Les Visiteurs , the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny . I like Jean Reno as an actor , but there was more . There were unexpected twists , funny situations and of course plain absurdness , that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.<br /><br />Now this sequel has the same characters , the same actors in great part and the same time traveling . The plot changes a little , since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers . So they jump up and down in history , without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie . The duke , Jean Reno , tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing , but his character has been emptied , so there 's not a lot he can do to save the film.<br /><br />Now the duke 's slave / helper , he has really all the attention . The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be . Fact is ; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience , but he does not succeed . It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke , you already know , but he insists on telling that joke till the end , adding details , to make your suffering a little longer.<br /><br />If you liked Les Visiteurs , do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel . If you did n't like Les Visiteurs , you would never consider seeing the sequel . If you liked this sequel ... well , I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies .
0 In a way , Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands . But it fails at making them laugh ... <br /><br />Les Visiteurs has had its success , because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis 's Back to the future , here comes the old France , the middle - age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life . Full of pride , funny thanks to the ancient words he uses , Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor . Then comes the sequel.<br /><br />Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs , the first . And it 's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.<br /><br />The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs , and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought . Explanation : it 's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; do n't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry ... And that 's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails.<br /><br />Let 's have a look at the characters : Montmirail does n't change , he 's just a little more boring . Regarding Frenegonde ... that 's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role . And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her . And Poiré does n't realize that a cast of humorists is n't enough to make a good comedy.<br /><br />Forget about the time travels , about the digital effects , concentrate on the story and you 'll see that there 's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.<br /><br />The main interest of this film is the landscapes . A movie for youngsters , let 's say up to 13 years old .
0 This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion . Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it . What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny . The actress replacing Jean Reno 's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married . Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it 's a waste of perfectly good film . The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions . This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well . This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a ' necklace ' . No script since it was apparently written and added to daily . No attention to camera or shots in mind . Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so . This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101 . How this pile got through no one can tell . It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries . This movie has one good part ... its END ! This film is my # 1 worst film of all time , finally " Howard The Duck " is no longer the goose .
0 Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie ! It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie ! My grandma could have done better than that ! But that 's not the only reason why this movie is really bad ! ( It 's actually so bad that I 'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark ! ) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs ' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . Clavier is over - acting his role even more than in the first part , Robin is trying to act like Lemercier ( because she 's replacing her ) but that 's grotesque ' . Lemercier is Lemercier , Robin is Robin ! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage , she is not in this movie because she 's not acting as she used to act . I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role ( Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie ) but she made a big mistake : instead of playing her role , she played Lemercier playing her role ' ! As for the story , it 's just too much ! Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . The gags are repetitive , childish and déjà - vu . No , really , there 's no more than 3 funny parts in this . The only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . So you have only 2 reasons to watch it : 1 ) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie , 2 ) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment ' ! 2/10
0 In 1993 , " the visitors " was an enormous hit in France . So , the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately , this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made . < br /><br />This is a movie that does n't keep its promises . Indeed , it 's supposed to tell a sole story . Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course . The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century , and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard ... Instead of this , the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot . As a consequence , the movie becomes sometimes muddle - headed , sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors . Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie : they 're going over the top and become annoying . Then , why did Jean - Marie Poiré the film - maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role ? He made a mistake because she seems ill - at - ease and is absolutely pitiful . The other actors are n't better : Marie - Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau , unbearable.<br /><br / > Of course , the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness . Certain sequences and dialogs are affected . It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie . Thus , a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.<br /><br />A labored and disappointing follow - up . Anyway , what 's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?<br /><br / >
0 The original " les visiteurs " was original , hilarious , interesting , balanced and near perfect . LV2 must be a candidate for " Worst first sequel to a really good film " . In LV2 everyone keeps shouting , when a gag does n't work first it 's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny . LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1 , except of course that a parody should be inventive . If you loved LV1 just do n't see this film , just see LV1 again ! !
0 Corridors of time . The movie you can watch if you 're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide . Some use guns , ropes , or gas , but you want to ruin your brains ? Do not wait any longer ! Corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes : thinking Christian Clavier is able to act and to bring you fun . I do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me : sometimes , one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero . This film deserves a 2/10 , but that 's only because I like Jean Reno . Too bad for him , he also stars in Ronin . I think I 'm gon na dislike him ...
0 Where to begin ? Anachronism ? High tech cross bow with a scope in about 500AD ? Arrows with explosive charges in 500AD ? A monster Grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him ? The heart torn out of his victim 's chest without any sense of contact ? Possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make - up and streaked hair ? The ancient Danish court represented in Classical Greek style ? The queen played by Marina Sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness ? The effects are way too weak to carry this story . There are some stories that do n't mind or even benefit from cheap effects , but this Grendel is n't one of them . < br /><br />What about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation ? A bravado idiot prince whose home has already been savaged more than once by the monster Grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than Beowulf who was sent from afar from the land of the Geats to help the desperate Danes . In this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth.<br /><br />Beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure . I suspect that any modern telling which does n't make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail . I did n't love the recent " Beowulf and Grendel " which sees Grendel essentially as human and sees Hrothgar and his Danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize Grendel 's attacks as well - justified vengeance , but I had to respect its revisionist position that Hrothgar 's Danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never grasped , even after it was all over , that they had brought this nightmare on themselves , and therefore , the original story of Beowulf , as it was written , was a misrepresentation of the real story . I think there 's a more complex meaning to be understood than that , but this " Grendel 's " terrible secret that Grendel 's attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice does n't really bring us closer to the shame experienced by Hrothgar and the Danes . < br /><br />This Beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy . I give it a 4 : higher than it deserves , but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently . In the meantime , Sci - Fi 's movie - making seems to be following the NASA policy that it 's better to build lots of probes that fail than a few that succeed .
0 Just once I 'd like to see a version of Beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem . Yet again , after watching this Sci Fi presentation , I 'm disappointed . < br /><br />I'm not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in Old English , but I wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern English and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires . The story is exciting enough ; why add plot elements that are non - existent and ruin the story ? What 's wrong with being faithful to the text ? < br /><br />Grendel is immune to weapons of any kind ; why introduce some super - crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period ( as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer ) ? The fight with Grendel was Beowulf vs. Grendel . That 's it . No one else took part in the battle . The only way Beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons , the mistake made by all previous challengers . Yet , in this version , Danes and Geats fight the beast and Beowulf hacks off Grendel 's arm with a sword ! Again , why could n't they portray what really happened ? Personally , I think a one - on - one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting . < br /><br />Overall , this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale . Why add in a pact with Hrothgar and Grendel 's mother that includes sacrificial offering ? Why create extra characters , like Finn , that add nothing to the story ? There was no love story in the poem . They could n't even set the scenes in the appropriate locations ( a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake ) . They fail to notice the metaphor that Grendel 's lair signifies  it 's supposed to be underground to represent hell . Why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem ? Even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on Beowulf , since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story . If Hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot , then that would be a truly great movie .
0 I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget , now my take on things.<br /><br />The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way . The fight scenes were n't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all . When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro . In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets . They may not look as fancy but at least they interact , just look at Peter Jacksons early films.<br /><br />As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where.<br /><br />The script seemed confused to me . One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech . I 'm not say it should be all ' ye ' and ' that it be ' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person.<br /><br />I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents.<br /><br />In short , this film is a very slightly polished turd , but a turn none the less .
0 Why oh why ca n't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale ? This is the second adaptation of " Beowulf " I 've been disappointed with in a year . But I have to say , the previous version ( " Beowulf & Grendel " , starring Gerald Butler ) was far superior to this . That one was only a little disappointing . This one is a mess ! ! ! < br /><br />What bugged me most ? Was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason ( Human sacrifices ? Pointless love interest ? ) , or the bad CGI , or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting ? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible ! ! ! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow ? < br /><br />And why did they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men , and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film . He was tossed around by both monsters he fought , relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon . Even when he slugged the arrogant prince , he did n't knock him out . He was much too reliant on weapons . Beo - wimp is more like it . This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem ! < br /><br />I'd like to end this on a positive note but I ca n't really think of one offhand . All I can say is , if you 've ever read " Beowulf " , you 'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal , inaccurate excuse for an adaptation !
0 This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG ( rocket - propelled grenade ) . It was like someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop . I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim , " I LIKE IT!" < br /><br />I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from " The Dead Zone " TV show and he did his part . He chose a strange accent , but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie -- unlike any of his costars . They kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old English to modern English , sometimes in the same sentence.<br /><br />There are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material . However , even on its own , this movie 's plot is not good . It 's just boring , which even the low budget does n't excuse . Having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story , dialog and decent acting . Those things do n't cost much . Instead , they spent their money on half - assed CGI and some decent costumes and sets.<br /><br />Life is too short to watch this movie .
0 This is a made - for - TV and rather needless Sci - fi Channel retelling of the Beowulf story , especially after the recent 2005 film " Beowulf and Grendel " . This movie does n't really get into Beowulf 's story , but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior , Beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster 's rampage . If this is successfully accomplished , the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay . After a few failed attempts , the creature is slain , but it 's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks , leaving it up to Beowulf to , again , lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it . " Grendel " looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible . Like I said , this movie is absolutely needless .
0 I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a Public Service Announcement.<br /><br />Grendel is another version of Beowulf , the thousand - year - old Anglo - Saxon epic poem . The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies , and the previews promised an inauthentic low - budget mini - epic , but this one refused to let me switch channels . It was staggeringly , overwhelmingly , bad . I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you could n't tear your eyes away from . I reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what I was seeing . The following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity . You 've been warned.<br /><br />- Just to get it over with , Beowulf 's warriors wore horned helmets . Trivial issue compared to what came after . It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next . Fit , appearance and function were apparently irrelevant.<br /><br />- Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the Ringling Brothers , Barnum and Bailey circus . She managed to avoid a red rubber nose , but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup.<br /><br />- Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king . His character , Hrothgar , must have become king of the Danes only minutes before the film opened and had n't had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet.<br /><br />- To facilitate the actors ' return to their day jobs waiting tables , none were required to change their hairstyles at all . The variety of hair included cornrows , sideburns , buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog . To prove it was a multi - national cast , all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose.<br /><br />- As is typical with this type of movie ( at least since Mad Max ) , leather armor was a requirement . In this case it was odd - shaped , ill - fitting and brand - new.<br /><br />- The female love interest , Ingrid , played by Alexis Peters , followed a long - standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down.<br /><br />- The unintended focus of the movie was a repeating , compound crossbow with exploding bolts . It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired . It managed to shred the laws of physics , the integrity of the original legend , historical fact and plot suspense all by itself.<br /><br />- Hrothgar 's palace , Heorot , rather than being a Norse long hall , apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with Atlantis.<br /><br />- Beowulf arrived at the Danes ' homeland in a two - masted stern - castled ship that originally was part of a set , the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta.<br /><br />- Prince Unferth observed Beowulf 's ship 's approach using a telescope . Before you could recover from that astounding innovation , you got to see the ship from his point of view . Judging from the angle , the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.<br /><br />- Fun fact 1 : In Bulgaria , fire ( as from a fireplace ) creates light without heat . This explains why you could see the actors ' breath whether indoors or out.<br /><br />- Fun fact 2 : Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade.<br /><br />- Fun fact 3 : You , too , can make a catapult with a timed - release air - burst explosive . But , do n't expect it to actually harm anything . Incidentally , Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II , yelling " Incoming ! " to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />- Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he could n't leave footprints . Even in snow.<br /><br />- Grendel 's mom ( " Hag " ) was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior had n't inherited her wings . Recessive gene , I suppose . By the way , we can now make an educated guess that Grendel 's pop was probably Swamp Thing.<br /><br />- Grendel and mom chose to randomly kill , fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script.<br /><br />- Fun medical fact : Being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that do n't bleed much.<br /><br />- The sword of legend Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge . Luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight.<br /><br />- Best line of the movie : Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet . Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said , " You 're going to be okay , my prince . " So much for that job at the triage clinic.<br /><br />I feel better now .
0 After having seen the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 production of " Beowulf & Grendel , " which I thought brilliant and stunning , I approached this -- the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year -- with trepidation . As soon as I heard " Viking " and saw the horned helmets , I groaned . These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes , not Vikings ( they came later ) . And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets ( horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you ) . Then there 's Hrolfgar 's palace , which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome , not 6th - century Denmark . The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods . I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in " Kingdom of Heaven , " and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from " Beowulf & Grendel " ! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem , the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing . The biggest yuk was a secret - weapon crossbow , complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles , that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents . The special - effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm , as he did in the poem . Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows ! I could go on , but I wo n't .
0 May the saints preserve us , because this movie is not going to help.<br /><br />Someone with access needs to e - mail Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf . Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature.<br /><br />The recent ( since 2000 ) versions of Beowulf make we wonder two things . First , why is there so much interest in the story . Second , why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crap.<br /><br />The only reason this got a two is that the version with Lambert in it ( Beowulf 2000 ) was worse and needed the 1.<br /><br />What is even worse , some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem . How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong . I mean really , the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much.<br /><br />And PLEASE , horns on helmets ? Spare me . This is insulting.<br /><br />/hjm
0 I stopped five minutes in when Beowulf was given a double - shot , automatic crossbow with sights on it . Not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights , but Beowulf beat Grendel in hand - to - hand combat . The terrible , wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci - Fi Original Movies did n't help either . Having only gotten a few minutes in before I felt my bile rise and decided to watch I Love Lucy reruns instead , that 's really about all I have to say . But , you might as well just realize that it 's a made - for - TV movie and skip it right there.<br /><br />A travesty .
0 It 's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show : the bad acting , poor acoustics of different portions , bad CGI , improper sets for the period , the poor script . It would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer -- there 's enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material , and a better story line , than the scriptwriters could come up with.<br /><br />And why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts?<br /><br />I see that this movie was made in " only " 21 days . It shows in the lack of quality . I 'm beginning to think this is general ( poor ) attitude taken by Sci - Fi channel ( and others ) when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years.<br /><br />What a waste !
0 I work at a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies , these are the kind of movies that the Sci - Fi channel shows . The kind of movie that nobody ever wants , and only that idiots rent , when they bring it back I ask them " was it any good ? " , they say " no we turned it off after 15 minutes ! " Movies with terrible computer generated , super imposed monsters and such like , very unappealing.<br /><br />This is the same type of movie that Grendel is , and absolute waste of time , if you want a reasonably ( and only reasonably ) good Beowulf based movie then try Beowulf & Grendel , starring Gerard Butler , who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300 , as King Leonidas of Sparta.<br /><br />Plus , later this year we have another Beowulf movie , with a star studded cast ranging from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson , to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich.<br /><br />But do n't let that get your hopes up like we all did with Eragon , or we are all in for another big disappointment.<br /><br />And regarding rentals , here is my rule of thumb : If there is only one or two copies , do n't rent it because its a load of crap . ( This is true 99.9 % of the time , usually not true if the title is foreign , or a documentary . )
0 Good Folks , I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers . My academic specialty is Anglo - Saxon literature , and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves . The Icelandic " Beowulf and Grendel " is the least offensive I have seen , and I did pay $ 3.00 for my copy . This Sci - Fi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version . Yuck.<br /><br />What did n't I like ? CGI for one . Amazingly bad . More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline , not to mention the stilted acting . I am used to both with all the versions I have seen.<br /><br />Delighted Regardless , Peter
0 First off , this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the Sci - Fi Channel has produced ; that is n't to say that Grendel is a good film , in fact , it is very bad , but it definitely had potential to be a lot better . The flaws of the film come from character design , character , absurd additions to the story , the visual effects , the music , and for the most part : the acting.<br /><br />When speaking of character design , I , of course , mean the way our heroes and villains look . Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings , rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly . Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle - attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />The characters are very limited . Beowulf is same from beginning to end , however Finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two - dimensionality , due thanks to his romantic subplot , and Unferth gets some notion as well , as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />Much like Finn , there are useless additions to this story to make it its own , while still holding to the source material . The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous , I 'm surprised the cast did n't walk off the set . Besides additions , there 's omissions , such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism , as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />The special effects are mighty terrible . Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived , and as such , they 're portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />The music is overbearing , especially when a character dies.<br /><br />All in all , this is not Sci - Fi 's worst film to date . No . It is actually one of the better films , though trash it still it is , it is good trash , making it a guilty pleasure at best . The only thing that works is the dialogue , which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis ' take on the ancient story of Beowulf , simply because this film ( Grendel ) is only half the tale , and not the whole thing , which garners this movie a three - star review .
0 I was expecting the movie based on Grendel , the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970 's . It was based on the Beowulf epic , but told from the perspective of the monster . < br /><br />Whatever you may think of Gardner 's book , a movie based on the Beowulf epic should not be entitled Grendel , when it does n't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a modified Predator . < br /><br />On top of this , the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass TV audiences throughout the US.<br /><br />Typical Hollywood to get this so wrong . < br /><br />Very disappointing and a complete waste of time .
0 SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately ( such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers ) . Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf , however , it deviates so much ( and offers so little in comparison ) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it ' some shitty Christopher Lambert movie ' . I was n't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production , but I did however expect the ' artistic integrity ' to not interfere with the actual story ( even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing ( did any research go into this ? ) . Obviously not , as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew ( save for mullet boy ) are wearing . One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel  if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him , should n't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons ? Grendel 's death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script ; for example : Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf  not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs ! And Grendel 's mother  did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds ? And honestly , what the hell was with that mullet ? < br /><br />If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic  .don't , as there really is n't one ( other than character names ) . The only way I could recommend this film is if you liked the movie Druids ( directed by Jacques Dorfmann )  although I do n't recommend watching either .
0 I understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel . Deathstalker , The Throne of Fire , Barbarian Queen , Conquest , the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor . The primitive costumes , dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film , but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters . Compare this film to Beowulf ( 1999 ) . It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci - fi/ adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters .
0 For such a great classic tale , the setting ( location ) , Grendel was disappointing . As a writer , I blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension . The rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic . For some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on . To know this was shot in 21 days says to me , " rushed " and it unfortunately shows . Now we 'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen . I word on FX , I can tolerate really crappy CGI but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow , spartan and lacking in drama . I 'd blame it on the actors but ... since I know writing more than acting , I 'll pick on my colleague .
0 This movie is a farce ! Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast . And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / crossbow weapon . Beowulf does n't need a weapon like that ! In the poem , he rips off Grendel 's arm with his bare hands ! And I ca n't believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing . The way Grendel is portrayed is impressive however . That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature . My English teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination . Unless you are a die - hard fan of the epic poem " Beowulf , " avoid this film at all costs . And even then , I would n't recommend it .
0 turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable sci - fi channel . i am not sure who wrote the script , and interpreted the poem , but i am sure it was by some 17 year old teen who thought it would be awesome to a have a scoped crossbow in the movie . AAAAAAAH ! when i saw that part , I lost all hope . Then ... they set off for heorot in a what looks to be the ship that Christopher Columbus sailed in ! when they reach Heorot , ( which is supposed to be a Norse mead hall ) the sci - fi group of idiots decided to make heorot look like a big stone castle . when i saw that part .. i wanted to scream . i really wanted this movie to be good , but sci - fi has yet to produce a good movie , so i do n't know why i got my hopes up . Oh .. and Grendel and his mother , are stupid also . ( this comment is off topic about " Grendel")If anyone from the sci - fi channel is reading this .. here is some good advice . NOT EVERY MOVIE YOU MAKE HAS TO BE ABOUT A BIG MONSTER THAT CAN RIP PEOPLE IN HALF , THATS NOT WHAT SCIENCE FICTION IS ABOUT ! AND ALSO , STOP CASTING LOW - GRADE ACTORS LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN TO BE IN YOUR FILMS ! ITS NOT HELPING THE MOVIE , BUT MAKING IT WORSE ! ! !
0 99.999 % pure crap . And the other .001 % was a brief moment where I thought the blond chick was going to disrobe . Nope.<br /><br />The dialogue was legendarily bad . The action sucked , and there was no sex ( the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed , alas , the whole movie ) . The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I 've ever seen on film , and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring . Acting was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis , the only ' names ' in this movie . And Marina Sirtis looked really , really bad.<br /><br />I've seen high school plays more capably produced . This is the kind of movie that MST3 K thrived on . Heads should roll at Sci - Fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air .
0 And that s about all that is . This thing is slow . The actors have ability , they just do n't seem motivated to put forth the effort . The plot is n't that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all . The accents , when there are any , are British . Uh , lots of these folks are supposed to be Danes . OK , OK , accents are n't that important . But language is . I do n't think they used words like " yeah " and " OK " in Beowulf 's day . And that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him ? Did he ever reload that thing ? Did he ever sight it in ? Or was Beowulf just that bad an aim ? Well , his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters . Those were rather off too . Bad special effects . Bright spot ? Just one that I can think of . Marina Sirtis has held up well over the years .
0 I am a great fan of the Batman comics and I became disappointed when I could no longer find Batman : The Animated Series on TV anymore . I was excited to learn that there was going to be a new Batman cartoon on TV . I watched the first episode the day it premiered and I was very disappointed.<br /><br />First of all , the animation is very poor . It looks like a cheap , crappy Japanese anime . Then again , just about every modern - day cartoon is like that.<br /><br />The character designs are even worse . Batman looks more like Birdman , Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman , Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk , the Penguin is a Kung - Fu master , Mr. Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head , and the Riddler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson look - alike ( which is funny because I do n't expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic).<br /><br />The worst character design is that of the Joker . They turned him into a monkey / demented Bob Marley / Kung - Fu fighter ! The Joker is supposed to be Batman 's deadliest enemy , but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless . In one episode his plan was to put his Joker venom in dog food ! Oh , how evil ! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents , which is why he fights crime . This version of Batman does n't seem haunted by his parents ' deaths and is not interesting at all . He 's also not a detective , just a fighter . If there 's an enemy he ca n't defeat , he wo n't study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would , he 'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them . A lot of times this show does n't even feel like a Batman show , just another brainless anime that 's nothing but pointless fighting.<br /><br />What I hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains . They 've taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys . Man - Bat is the biggest example . In the comics , he 's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness . When experimenting on himself , he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature . In this show , he 's a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason . Just about all the villains are like that ; none of them , with the exception of about one or two , have an actual motive for their crimes.<br /><br />The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze . In the comics , Freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode " Heart of Ice " , which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic , three - dimensional , and likable villain . The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin . Even that crappy movie Batman & Robin used it as his origin . In this show , he 's a petty jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze . After becoming Mr. Freeze , guess what ? He 's STILL a petty jewel thief ! Great origin . No wonder they used it over the one Dini created.<br /><br />As a Batman fan , I do n't dislike this show just because it is n't like the comics because I also liked BTAS , the Batman cartoons that came after it , Tim Burton 's Batman films , and obviously , the superb Christopher Nolan Batman films . None of them were 100 % loyal to the comics , but they were still very good . The problem with this show is not that it 's not exactly like the comics or BTAS , it 's that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other Batman media so popular.<br /><br />I've given this show so many chances , but the more I watch , the more I find that disappoints me . I miss the good old days back when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy .
0 Remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90 's ? The one that people praised ? The one that people of all ages could all appreciate ? The one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the Hulk in a bat suit ? The one that had villains you could relate to ? The one that had villains with real motives?<br /><br />Well clearly , Warner Bros. does n't . Hence this dreck.<br /><br />Honestly , do these people know anything about batman ? Have they even looked at a batman comic before ? Do they know Batman 's meant to be a ' detective ' ? Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective ! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!<br /><br />This is the basic layout for an episode:<br /><br />Penguin steals something . ' Opening credits ' . Batman finds dead giveaway of where he is . Batman goes there and get 's into trouble . Commercial . Batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it . Penguin escapes . Penguin does something obvious again . Batman follows . They do kung - fu ( by the way everyone , and i mean EVERYONE know 's kung - fu for some reason ) . Batman punch 's penguin . he get 's knocked out . goes to arkham . ( Note : it 's usually a different villain every episode)<br /><br />Well as you may have noticed from that , Batman 's not a great detective . " Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground , maybe he 's at the old amusement park " ! Yeah maybe , he was there the last 6 times.<br /><br />And I 've already mentioned this but , EVERYONE KNOWS KUNG - FU ! EVEN PENGUIN ! what where they thinking ? ( probably because it 's from the people who made that Jackie Chan animated series)<br /><br />What 's really upsetting is that the show is just action . No smarts . None . If batman needs think , he 'll use technology , then do some kung - fu.<br /><br />But hey , let 's not forget the villains . Afterall , what would batman be without his rogues gallery?<br /><br />Well first off , I got ta say , kudos for originality . I do n't think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread - locked monkey man , riddler like an emo , and poison ivy as a minor ( which is kind of confusing when you think about , is n't her sexuality meant to be her main strength?)<br /><br />What 's even more crap however is that , every character is now a 2-Dimensional , stereotypical crook.<br /><br />E.G.<br /><br />Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason.<br /><br />Man - Bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason.<br /><br />Penguin just wants to steal everything . For no reason.<br /><br />noticing a pattern here?<br /><br />But the most insulting has got to be Mr Freeze.<br /><br />Do you remember the Emmy award winning ' Heart of Ice ' episode from Batman : The Animated Series ? The one that gave Mr Freeze motives for his crimes ? The episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story ( mad scientist ) ? The one that made him a victim , with a goal ? Hell , even Batman & Robin acknowledged that , using that as Mr Freezes origin in that P.O.S. movie.<br /><br />Well this series says " F#ck that " and makes Mr Freeze a jewelry robber before his accident , with only wealth in his mind , then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold . He then continues to steal jewels for no reason , while saying sh!t lines like " Have an ice day".<br /><br />Maybe they did watch Batman & Robin after all.<br /><br />But hey , look on the bright side . This series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that you 're a good person . Good for you .
0 Not only did they get the characters all wrong , not only do the voices suck , not only do the writers seriously need to get girlfriends , not only are the drawings really crude , but it seems like it was mainly created for ages 1 - 6 . The only episode I 've ever seen of this show that kept me watching , was " A Mattter Of Family " , because I liked the Robin character . And sometimes I think it 's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series . Example : In BTAS , Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent , yeah ? Over a two episode story , he transforms into the unlikely villain , TwoFace . In the " Show " Bruce is Friends with that Ethan guy , and over a two episode story , he Transforms into the unlikely villain ClayFace . That was just a small example ( That may not even be true ) , but in short , this is the WORST attempt on a Batman series . And That 's saying something .
0 I ca nt believe some people actually like this . Yet still call themselves Batman fans . Even going as far as to say it 's better than BTAS . Which it 's not . It should be plagiarism for them to use Batman 's name for this piece of crap . It 's not Batman.<br /><br />The whole premise of the show is ' ' if you ca nt defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you '' Batman is n't all about weapons . He uses his batarang and grappling hook and Batmobile , that s it . He does n't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he ca nt beat someone . I do n't know where the hell they got the idea for a Batbot . or whatever . They have ruined all the villains . Mr. Freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing . Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume . Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft . tall top hat . The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface making the Dummy the whole centerpiece for the character . They even got a dumb idea to make him a giant ! wtf ? and the two worst character changes are that of The Joker and Riddler . they have changed Riddler to a Gothic / retro teenage freak . and The Joker to an acrobat with dreads . He looks like a bob Marley wannabe . they have completely and utterly ruined batman even moreso than B&R did ! i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could whack them in the head with a metal baseball bat .
0 When this cartoon first aired I was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent , boy was I wrong . I must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago . I watched a few episodes and two of them had Batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the crap out of Batman and I watched another episode where Batman got his butt kicked again by the Joker , who apparently was using Jackie Chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja . Since when were the Joker or the Penguin ever a match for Batman ? and worse yet when were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li . It 's truly embarrassing , depressing and sad the way the image of Batman is portrayed in this show . The animation is awful and the dialog is terrible . Being a Batman fan since my boyhood I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost , because it does n't project the true image of Batman . This cartoon is more like a wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really wanna see a classic Batman cartoon I strongly recommend Batman the Animated Series , but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T ! Get Batman : The Animates Series and do n't waste your time with this cartoon .
0 In light of the recent and quite good Batman the Brave and the Bold , now is the time to bear a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of Batman . Being a huge fan since the first revival by Tim Burton 20 years ago , I have been able to accept different tonalities in the character , dark or campy . This one is just not credible : too many effects , poor intrigues and so few questions . What is great about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality : detective , crime - fighter , playboy , philanthropist etc . The Batman shows him only in his karate days . And by the way , how come the Penguin is capable of such virtuosity when jumping in the air regardless of his portly corpulence ? And look at the Joker , a mixture of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man , what Batman fan could accept such a treason ? Not me anyway . Batman is much better without " The " article in front of his name .
0 I was raised watching the original Batman Animated Series , and am an avid Batman graphic novel collector . With a comic book hero as iconic as Batman , there are certain traits that can not be changed . Creative liberties are all well and good , but when it completely changes the character , then it is too far . I purchased one of the seasons of " The Batman " in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators ' reasoning for making this show such an atrocity . In an interview on the making of " The Batman , " one of the artists or writers ( I 'm unsure which ) said that " We felt we should n't mess with Batman , but we could mess with the villains . " So , they proceeded to make the Joker into an immature little kid begging for attention , the Penguin into some anime knockoff , Mr. Freeze into a super - powered jewel thief , Poison Ivy into a teenage hippie , and countless other shameful acts which are making Bob Kane roll over in his grave . < br /><br />To sum it all up : I wish I had more hands so I could give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN . It squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name . Warner Bros ... rethink this ! Please !
0 I have never commented on IMDb before , but I feel I have to after watching The Batman animation . Its absolute rubbish ! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula ? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB . The original animation was dark and brooding , exactly the way Batman was intended to be . WB had to mess this up with some tripe Batman of the Future . Now they produce this drivel . The Joker does n't remotely resemble the Joker from DC comics . DC should sue . I urge everyone who agrees with me to email or write to WB and use people power to get back the original formula
0 Okay , I 've always been a fan of Batman . I loved the animated series , and even Batman Beyond . I even read a batman comic now and then . So as can be imagined -- I was a little excited when I heard about this series , and then I was SEVERELY disappointed . This series is nothing . It does n't even begin to compare with the original series . It 's like one long TOY commercial . No depth whatsoever . And what the heck was with the Joker ? Who , in my most humble opinion , is the best Batman villain of ALL time and they KILLED him . I wish I could say his design was the worst part . Actually , I wish I could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting . In short ( because believe me I could say so much more)do NOT waste your time on this show , or your money .
0 I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a " thumbs in the middle " review , remarking that I 'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode . I 've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006 . And as a lifelong Batman fanatic , I can say without hesitation : this show is utter crap.<br /><br />Everything 's wrong with it . Everything . Getting past just the lousy animation and design , the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br /><br />And for God 's sake ... is it just me , or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE ? ? Is Gotham that much of a revolving - door justice system ? Or , again , is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains ( see " no character development " , above).<br /><br />And to make matters worse , every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br /><br />1 ) Joker gasses people.<br /><br />2 ) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br /><br />3 ) Batman saves the day.<br /><br />Pfeh.<br /><br />There was one episode I saw that was n't a Joker story . The title escapes me , but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster ... the " Think Thank Thunk " episode with the quiz show . That was the single - worst Batman story I 've ever seen , heard or read . Yes , worse than " I 've Got Batman in My Basement . " < br /><br />I ca n't really say what I feel this show is because it 's probably against the ToS , but it starts with " B " and rhymes with " fastardization " . Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm / Dini / etc . era of Bat - entertainment , back from the Fox and Kids WB days . Stuff that good , and I should have known this , just could n't possibly have lasted forever , unfortunately .
0 I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything . Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet . It 's just too damn good . Was Batman Beyond good ? " Yeah , but it was no TAS . " Is Justice League good ? " It 's not too bad , but it 's no TAS." < br /><br />The Batman is certainly no TAS , either , but I wo n't hold that against it . It would be unfair and besides , it has plenty of other problems with it.<br /><br />The concept of a younger , less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one , and at times the art is very nice . But all of the rest of the time , the art is worthless Americanime , and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself . It is paced , written , and designed like an Americanime . If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures , I 'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures . Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect . The Joker is a homicidal , mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits , unpredictability , and clever gadgets to fight Batman . When he is forced to fight hand to hand , he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched . He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung - fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air , accompanied by speed lines . If they had wanted to do that with a villain , there were other less important characters they could have used or * gasp * they could have created a new one entirely . And it 's not that re - imaginings are a bad thing , do n't get me wrong . TAS ( there I go again ) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun - wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character . Of course Freeze was n't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade , but the point stands . What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large , smelly dump on them . Guess what ? They were eating corn.<br /><br />It 's obvious this show ca n't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still does n't work for me . The plots are n't good and they do n't develop any better . They 've been written for the demographic of children under twelve . Should children be able to enjoy a show ? Of course they should . This should n't be an adult show with swearing , nudity , and gratuitous violence . But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages . This show misses that mark.<br /><br />Is this show a TAS ? No , of course not . The problem is it 's not even a JLU .
0 OK OK , it might be hard to put the entirety of a man 's life in one film . Traditionally therefore , biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject 's life . Now , Byron was a " my week beats your year " fellow , which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder . Furthermore , just as Byron 's poetry is inseparable from his life , the man 's life itself must be seen as a whole . Lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture , it 's showing a different picture altogether.<br /><br />Now , in short my review comes down to this : supposedly , Byron was indeed the " my week beats your year " prototype , a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime . True , he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in - but in the end , this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we 'd all want to lead , no ? Well , I did NOT , at ANY moment , want to live the life depicted in this film . So it gets 3 . Not for being so badly done ( which , direction - wise , it more or less was ) , but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot.<br /><br />Some more detail . Well , to over simplify things , a Byron bio should have two distinct episodes : 1 . Post - first Europe trip : England and his rise to fame + marriage / 2 . His life abroad . Now , the important thing is that the SECOND part should be at least as important as the first . Not only was it a lot longer , but the most significant change in Byron took place then . Furthermore , it 's where he created his best works ( Don Juan , the Vision of Judgement etc . - all the stuff that makes him * really * unique in English literature).<br /><br />Instead , in this film ( a ) Byron 's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining , ( b ) it only gets * worse * after he leaves England . They did two good jobs : first , they started at his return of his Europe trip ( though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue ) , second , they chose an angle , and they chose his incestuous love for Augusta ( who is rather perfectly cast ) . The problem with this last thing is that they never let it go . True , Byron remained strongly attached to Augusta for the rest of his life , but , especially as he was such a mood swing person , the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life.<br /><br />Anyway , the first part of the TV film should have ended with him leaving England . There 's no doubt about that . The thing is : once abroad , a life of debauchery began ( with the infamous Geneva period ) , but in Italy Byron also discovered a new life , both for his poetry ( inspired by Italian comedy ) , already in Venice , and for himself when he found the Contessa Teresa Guiccioli and moved to Ravenna ( afterwards , at the request of Shelly , with Teresa , to Pisa ) . In other words , he was also * liberated*. His mind and life opened up ( and not only in the decadent sense ) , while England 's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the Victorian age . True , freedom was Augusta - less , but this bitter - sweet freedom tastes sour in this film . We see a lonely , bored snob getting older.<br /><br />I mean , hell , Byron never thought much about his poetry , except when he finally found his own voice in Don Juan ! Apart from poetic and romantic developments , his relationship with Shelly ( and the down - break ) should have been more documented . Also , it is in Italy in Ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas . This is important , as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of Childe Harold is changing into the more planted - in - life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of Don Juan . Life and work are one . True , still a bit naive , but it 's what got him to Greece ! And the whole thing came full circle in Pisa , where Shelley 's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark . Missolonghi was n't the bored snob suddenly looking for some action . It was the insights in Italy ( the Gambas ) stirring him into action . It can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient - style battle excitement while the rest of Europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism . But it was n't just that , there was a true inspiration behind it . Meanwhile , Byron wrote massive amounts of Don Juan . True , his end is a bit sad , but it 's not like he 's worn out . THAT is the essence of Byron 's life : he may have had some strong emotional attachments ( 2 : Augusta and Teresa ) , but EVERY time he managed to reinvent himself truly . Meaning that he was n't ' less ' at the end of his life - no , he 'd made a physical and mental JOURNEY that , at the time , few people were prepared to make.<br /><br />I wonder . Why is it that so often the second period in Byron 's life is overlooked ? Because it had less obvious conflicts , as the man was finally coming to his own ? In focusing our attention on the frustrated England years fraught with scandals , we show ourselves to be not much better than the English aristocracy at the time , which Byron so despised , and which , despite the fact that he had no choice , he * willingly * fled in 1816 , to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self - obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause .
0 I 've always been enthusiastic about period dramas , an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past . This presentation of " Byron " was unbelievable . Unbelievably bad ! The script was dreadful , the acting uninspired , and all the characters woefully insipid . Apparently Byron was " mad bad and dangerous to know " , and set the ladies hearts all - a - flutter . Not in this production . Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped - up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence . It is said that Byron walked with a limp . This portrayal of the man was just limp all over.<br /><br />I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life . Not a splutter , not even a glimmer . It was utter tedium , if not downright boredom , from start to finish.<br /><br />Having the opinion that no - one will ever better the Bard of Avon , I also believe that Byron 's poetry is over - revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner , and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment.<br /><br />I think the BBC lost its nous with this one
0 Dieter Bohlen , Germany 's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like " You 're my heart , you 're my soul " felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer . The result was a funny book about his life . Well , more or less a fuzzy image of it . He did n't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself . No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital . However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of " American Idol " - especially his unforgettable comments.<br /><br />This should be the end of the story - really . In the hype of the mentioned " Idol " TV show called " Deutschland sucht den Superstar " ( abbreviated DSDS ) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book . The result is " Dieter - der Film" < br /><br />I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely . None of the gags really hits the point . Naddel 's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona 's voice should have done that more . Obvious , childish , predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes . The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen 's sloppy idealized memory . They could have used this freedom to do almost everything . It was supposed to be a satire , but they failed . The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.<br /><br />It 's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release . The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success . With the " friendly " help of Germany 's biggest yellow press newspaper " BILD " and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show " Wetten dass ... ? " is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.<br /><br />Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.<br /><br />Therefore : 2/10
0 Admittedly , I watched this piece with already VERY low expectations . Dieter Bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego.<br /><br />This was the first cartoon movie that I watched that was 100 per cent humor free . It is rude , offensive , redneck and blatantly anti- women . As such , it is a creation befitting Bohlen , but the average viewer will be rather put off by it . No wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater : It would 've bombed BIG time!<br /><br />Not even the expense of 6.5 MegaEuros were able to save this utter piece of crap . Save your time ... and money !
0 Sure , this one is n't really a blockbuster , nor does it target such a position . " Dieter " is the first name of a quite popular German musician , who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and that s exactly what this movie is about . It is based on the autobiography " Dieter Bohlen " wrote a few years ago but is n't meant to be accurate on that . The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content ( at least for American standard ) which is either amusing ( not for the other " actors " of course ) or dumb - it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a " Bohlen "- Fan or not . Technically speaking there is n't much to criticize . Speaking of me I find this movie to be an OK - movie .
0 So why does this show suck ? Unfortunately , that really is the only question , because there is no doubt that it does.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show , the doomed - to - be - shortlived series Cavemen focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day America and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for Geico Insurance . The concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully.<br /><br />I had to think about it for awhile , but then the tagline from the commercials -- something to the effect of " We 're not that much different from you " provided me with the key to the show 's suckiness . Even though cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity , the title characters of this show , it turns out , are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks.<br /><br />Maybe its my background as a game writer -- rather than a soulless , hack , committee - based writer from California -- but this show had so much potential , and none of it has been realized . To start with , the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us.<br /><br />What could conceivably be funny , for example , about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk , when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks ? Why would they play prosaic games like squash , when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears ? A show like this could write itself , and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring.<br /><br />Another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities . Yawn ! This has been done so many times before , and never more drearily than this . And , as noted previously , Neanderthals really are a different species , so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark.<br /><br />Responses are welcome , including those from anyone who wants to tell me why I 'm wrong . I 'd like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that I have thus far been unable to.<br /><br />Michael J. Varhola , Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
0 I have watched 3 episodes of Caveman , and I have no idea why I continue except maybe waiting for it to get better . < br /><br />To me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials , with no real humor . As we sat around watching these shows , we all speculated on what was going to happen.<br /><br />The episode of the woman cave - woman with a attitude was actually a big , yea right , for us . she 's crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers , and truth be told , she needed a slap < br /><br />I consider myself a pretty good reviewer , taking in everything , but I must say , Cavemen is comparable to the old show , My mother , the car . I give it a 2 , only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it .
0 Every new fall line - up show deserves , at least , my " 3 strikes and you 're out " policy . I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh , that is , 3 complete episodes . After Episode 1 , I actually said to the TV,"Cancelled tomorrow " . It was that bad . I have now watched the first 4 episodes of " Cavemen " and have yet to manage even a smirk . Not a titter , a guffaw , a chortle , as a matter of fact , no facial movement at all . I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this show . I 'm simply not " getting " it , but I believe that a comedy on a major TV network in prime - time , just HAS to be funny ; but there are no laughs from me YET . There 's just no way that ABC would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m. I KNOW there has got to be an inside joke that just is n't jiving with my brain . I 've read each of the previous comments , I " get " the social aspect of it , but , WHERE ARE THE JOKES ? ? ? ? I shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week , until I have a light - bulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting " Eureka " .
0 I actually did n't mind the Geico commercials the first 50 of so times I saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing , BUT SERIOUSLY ! This is the BEST thing that these people could come up with ? ! ? This show sucks ! It is bland and feels like watching an episode of " The Office " with the characters disguised as cavemen ( I know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but " The Office " just does not do it for me ) . Okay , I get it : we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him ; the pseudo - intellectual who really just has a barely - functioning intellect ; and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted , but SO WHAT ! ! ! I have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as I do on TV ... why would I want to waste another 1/336th of my week watching more of those type nominates ? ! ? Please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it , you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment .
0 This show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious DVR hard drive space . I did n't expect much and I actually received less . Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode , I can not believe that Geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign EVER again . I would have preferred spending a night checking my daughter 's hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse . I wonder what ABC passed on to make this show fit into the ' 07 fall schedual , perhaps a hospital / crime / mocumentary reality show featuring the AFLAC duck ? In the event that I failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good .
0 Peeew this stinks ! As everyone knows it 's based upon some Geico insurance commercials ; what no one knows is WHY ? ! Those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best ; hardly fodder for a series . ( The talking Geico gecko -- that 's another story . Now that would make for an intriguing series ! ) And why on earth did ABC -- as reported in the press -- actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from Geico for this ? After all , the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to TV ; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago . And that 's how a concept like this works best -- as an occasional installment . But a regular series ? Fuhgeddaboudit . ( A 1960s series called " It 's About Time " also used the cavemen in the modern world concept . It lasted one season . ) < br /><br />One of the show 's directors , who was also responsible for the Geico commercials , was recently quoted as saying : " We were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell . " Wrong.<br /><br />In the annals of bad TV , this is destined to take its place alongside 1972 's " Me and the Chimp " as one of the all - time worst . The lead actor in the embarrassing Chimp fiasco actually went into shame - by - association hiding after it was abruptly canceled . No doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit .
0 Cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap I have ever wasted my time watching . This show based on the Geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for Geico . The makeup was half ass - ed to say the least , hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist . This show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials , that in it self makes for a lousy show . Perhaps if the writers were the same from the Geico ads this may of had a chance , instead the pilot lacked a good story line . I give this show a 1 out of 10 , I would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option . I pray for a quick death to this show , I 'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death .
0 This is 30 minute show about one joke . The joke , Cavemen are not treated fairly . HaHaHa ! ! ! He ca n't dial a phone because he is a Caveman . Cavemen are not as smart as human beings . Oh jeez , those Cavemen are so unsophisticated . There is no humor in this show . They can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the Geico commercials . This show does not deserve a time slot on national T.V. < br /><br />This show tries to hard to be funny , but it just is n't . Watching this show , I was thinking that it was trying to be like a " Bachelor 's Gone Wild Show . " Meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women . The crying caveman is annoying . The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman(HAHAHA ! ! ! ) . All three of them have personalities , but I ca n't figure out why I do n't care about them .
0 I wasted my time and gave this show a chance . This has to be one of the worst new shows . If they gave an award to shows that suck THIS one should sweep the category . The acting is poor and the story line is contrived . Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining . That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped . This new show , based on an insurance companies commercials , is not funny and really has nothing going for it . Possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were , and still are , repeated is what is wrong with this show . It just came to TV and already we are tired of seeing the " caveman " characters .
0 " Cavemen " exceeded my expectations , and not in a good way . It was even worse than I thought it would be . Basically , here 's the show : The Cavemen are an alternate race , they face prejudice , etc . Quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created ; almost being worthy of jail time for the writers . One show featured the cavemen going into a club , trying to pick up girls , and then nothing else happened . It was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute Andy Rooney dialog , followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals . For those who have not seen this show , here 's an example of the dialog : " You 're sure you 're okay with going out with a caveman . " " Yeah , that 's fine . I 've had like 10 - thousand ! " Hilarious ... Possibly the best writing I 've ever witnessed.<br /><br />22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup , tackling tough social issues ... Sounds like an entertaining night . I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they 're resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials . I wonder if they 'll do the Gecko next , so that I can have a new title for the worst show I 've ever seen . I would even say that this is worse than " Viva Laughlin . " At least " Viva Laughlin " was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired.<br /><br />Shows like this make me hope that there 's a comet up there somewhere aimed for Earth.<br /><br />(Unratable honestly ... )
0 Warped take on the Pinocchio theme , and set during the Christmas season( .. after the previous entry abandoned ties to Christmas ) has booby - trapped toys sent to murder a child( .. yet through this , other victims are accidentally harmed in the process)perhaps by a toy maker 's " son " . Screaming Mad George was responsible for the killer toys( .. including a larvae which enters a victim 's mouth and out his eye , another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy , operating from a remote control ) . The little target is a mute child named Derek(William Thorne)whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face , causing him to land on a fireplace poker . Mother Sarah(Jane Higginson)worries about her son 's mental state , figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or , more importantly , talking , derives from watching her husband 's horrific murder . Derek 's real father , Noah(Tracy Fraim)fears for his son't safety , and informs , reluctantly , his ex - girlfriend Sarah that the local toymaker , Joe Petto(Mickey Rooney)once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash .. kind of a retaliation in saying that if he could n't have a son , then others should n't either . Still quite a heavy drinker( .. often seen swigging Jack ) , Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids , but his creepy son Pino(Brian Bremer)hasn't and Derek he harbors angst towards . Why ? You 'll soon understand.<br /><br />Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise . Rooney 's name adds an allure to the film , gaining it a notoriety , but his histrionics can only help so much . Attractive lead actress Higginson(Slaughterhouse)and Fraim as the man who re - enters her life are n't so bad , but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously . I 'm guessing that 's the point , but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this .. he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation , quite volatile , barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino , when not downing liquor . Bremer is appropriately weird and " robotic " as Pino , longing to have Sarah as his mama . The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing .. Screaming Mad George 's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film . The sex everyone talks about is n't as gratuitous as many would have you believe( .. I ca n't even recall any nudity ) . Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted , but that 's not exactly an endorsement . I 'm pretty sure written on paper , this was an entertaining concept , the idea of spoofing Pinocchio using horror elements , but the result does n't exactly blow you away .
0 This movie was n't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original . It 's directed by Martin Kitrosser of Friday the 13th fame . The acting is very bad indeed , but the gore and special effects help make it interesting . That s one thing I like about Screaming Mad George ( make up effects artist for the film ) , his effects are so off - the - wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they 're gon na get . The movie is n't really all that gory , but there is an EXTREMELY nasty eyeball - munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot ( what ! ? ! ) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably was n't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time , possibly ? If you liked the weirdo 4th installment ( my favorite of all 5 ) , you 'll probably like this one . I liked it better than the Matrix ! Enjoy .
0 Silent Night , Deadly Night 5 is the very last of the series , and like part 4 , it 's unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that it 's a Christmas - themed horror flick.<br /><br />Except to the oblivious , there 's some obvious things going on here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and his creepy son 's name is Pino . Ring a bell , anyone ? Now , a little boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one evening , and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him . Even though it said " do n't open till Christmas " , he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad , who scolds him and sends him to bed , and opens the gift himself . Inside is a little red ball that sprouts Santa arms and a head , and proceeds to kill dad . Oops , maybe he should have left well - enough alone . Of course Derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs , but he does n't grow up to be some killer Santa , he just stops talking.<br /><br />There 's a mysterious stranger lurking around , who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes . We even see him buying a bunch when Derek 's mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma . And what exactly is this guy doing ? Well , we 're not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick . He does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a " Larry the Larvae " toy for his kid , but of course " Larry " is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course , well , things are n't pretty.<br /><br />Anyway , eventually what 's going on with Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed , and as with the old story , Pino is not a " real boy " . Pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from " Kenitalia " ( a smooth plastic crotch ) so that could account for his evil ways . And the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too , and there 's even kind of a happy ending of sorts . Whee.<br /><br />A step up from part 4 , but not much of one . Again , Brian Yuzna is involved , and Screaming Mad George , so some decent special effects , but not enough to make this great . A few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too , like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter , but that does n't really make any difference . Anyway , I now have seeing the whole series out of my system . Now if I could get some of it out of my brain . 4 out of 5 .
0 This time we get a psycho toy maker named " Joe Petto " ( get it ? ) who makes living , evil toys that kill people . He goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son " Pino " ( again , get it ? ) used to live.<br /><br />Easily the worst ( and hopefully [ presumably ] the last ) in this semi - series , this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies , but without the sex and nudity . It 's kind of like a low rent hybrid of " Halloween III " , " Puppet Master " , " Dolls " and bad home movies . Supposedly in 2000 they started to do a sixth chapter in the series , but it was abandoned and never completed . We can all only hope that it stays that way ... <br /><br />1/2 a star out of * * * * < br /><br / >
0 Bad actors , terrible script , totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all . After seeing films like this , you wonder why the makers bothered at all . This film has absolutely nothing to say , all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films . A total waste of time .
0 The spoilers in this review are offered as a public service , because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist , the Lady Barbara Skelton , gets raped and gunned down in the end . And not a moment too soon . I 'd have shot the screen myself but I was afraid I 'd hit James Mason.<br /><br />The original 1943 novel , called " The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton " ( I guess people did n't whine about spoilers back then ) , was written by a woman , an English navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both . Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful , and the author seems to think that if you have beauty , nothing else matters . But other things do matter , such as the fact that Lady Barbara 's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide . She murders three men in five attempts . A serial femme fatale , she 's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either Bedlam or Newgate . < br /><br />Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp , wearing so much makeup that I thought of her as a Restoration - era Joan Rivers ( or a restoration - era Joan Rivers , ha ! ) . Yet Lady B. is irresistible to all three principal male characters-- Michael Rennie , James Mason , and Griffith Jones , all of whom do good work , as does Patricia Roc . Of course , all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch Barbara is , but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down - accidentally , in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts . Given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward , I presume we 're meant to give a damn about her death . But hers is the first corpse we do n't care about .
0 This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day . A wealthy upper class English woman schemes , plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction . She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti - social kind . There 's a clever sex - role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters . But naturally there 's a tall , dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest , and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.<br /><br />The wishy - washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme , but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that .
0 Lois Weber , self proclaimed missionary via the cinema , wrote , directed and produced other films on controversial subjects , but this may be the first to get wide viewing , thanks to TCM . This film is her indictment of abortion , but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control , leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion . Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here , but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically . If you have wondered what Tyrone Power , Jr. 's " famous father " looked like , here is your chance . 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece . It 's enjoyable even if you do n't appreciate the propaganda .
0 I saw this movie for 2 reasons -- I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer . Unfortunately , these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie . I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot , because it does explain his disdain for all things Christian , but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been . I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public ( me and the 5 other people who saw this film ) that he still exists . I actually enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself .
0 Please do n't waste your time . This movie rehashes the worst of Bram Stoker 's Dracula ( Van Helsing ) , Anne Rice 's Vampire Lestat ( rock music and silly biblical references ) , and Blade ( high - tech toys ) . I really like vampire movies and novels , and there are many out there that are very good . But not this stinker . Not even the soundtrack helps it , mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the " kick - ass metal " some reported . Only a few times did I hear any metal ; mostly it was tortured violins . Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes .
0 This film is really bad . It maybe harsh , but it is . It really is . Poor script , every vampire cliché in the book is used , and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole Dracula . There have been some truly brilliant Dracula / vampire movies in the past , but this does n't even make it into the " dire " slot.<br /><br />Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen - slasher move , add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious / surreal day - dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - Dracula 2000.<br /><br />I really can not find any good things to say about this movie , as if it was n't bad enough that it was made in the first place , they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent ... What s the problem with that I hear you cry ... Well , he is English , but he sounds like an American trying to do an English accent.<br /><br />All in all you may as well say your money ( if you were thinking of buying it ) , or rent it out , watch it , and discover for yourself why it 's about as scary as the Tellytubbies.<br /><br />P.S. Although La La is pretty frightening !
0 This has to be one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . This movie has nothing positive about it . Some of you people actually like this movie ! I 've seen a lot of Dracula movies and I 've liked everyone that I 've seen , but when I saw this movie I said to myself , " What the hell is this ? " What a stupid movie . Now they have Dracula becoming who he is because he is Judas . For those of you who do n't know who Judas is , he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty he hung himself . You have to be kidding me . That 's the dumbest reason I 've ever heard for why Dracula became evil . Who asked for a reason anyway ? What a piece of sh * * this movie is . Who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a movie should be beaten . Even the Dracula is horrible . If you ever saw this movie you would n't even think it was Dracula . Wow , Dracula 2000 ! Is that title supposed to impress me ? Do n't waste your time or your money on this trash .
0 DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on Sky Movies in Britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . Actually seeing as I`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . My theory was proved right for the most part < br /><br / > ! ! ! ! ! MINOR SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved . For example early in the film the bad guys are flying Dracula`s coffin from London to America ( In a twin engine turbo prop plane ! ) and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where Dracula comes to life . A fight breaks out , there`s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don`t hear a sound until the script demands it . It also appears in this segment`s climax that Dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . Sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there`s numerous scenes of characters being at the New Orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they`re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced < br /><br />There`s something else that yanked my chain - Product placement . There`s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record label / retailer chain is in full view . I won`t dare publicise the company brand ( Except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in Britain ) but I was under the impression this type of advertising was against British broadcasting guidlines and I`m surprised the BBC showed this movie if that`s the case < br /><br />There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 like the visuals for example . This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it`s something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - A very good looking movie that`s very dumb
0 Put the blame on executive producer Wes Craven and financiers the Weinsteins for this big - budget debacle : a thrash - metal updating of " Dracula " , with a condescending verbal jab at Bram Stoker ( who probably would n't want his name on this thing anyway ) and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher - styled jolts and gore . Christopher Plummer looks winded as Van Helsing in the modern - day -- not just a descendant of Van Helsing but the real thing ; he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from Count Dracula 's corpse , which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing 's vault and flown to New Orleans . This is just what New Orleans needs in the 21st Century ! The film , well - produced but without a single original idea ( except for multi - racial victims ) , is both repulsive and lazy , and after about an hour starts repeating itself . * from * * * *
0 A very slick modern ( keeping it sensually hip ) revamp on the Dracula story ( although staying with the traditional customs ) with quite an interesting , if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness . The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through , before losing interest . Again it gets off to a good start ( especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula ) , but then for me it got less involving when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing 's daughter . A great place to set it , but never took advantage of its settings ( despite etching a paradise in damn , where Dracula could flourish ) . Produced by Wes Carven ( and yeah they throw that name out there ) , but written / directed by Patrick Lussier . Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals , but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts do n't help . The messy script does get considerably silly . Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy , inserting a lot of blood ( the make - up is suitably achieved ) and a lot of " Virgin " advertising . No I do n't mean virgins , it 's the music company , as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing 's daughter works there too . Oh that was n't obvious planting . The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes . Now the performances are all over the shop , but there are few familiar faces to spot ( Danny Masterson , Sean Patrick Thomas , Nathan Fillion , Shane West and Lochlyn Munro ) . Gerard Butler as Dracula just did n't come off , as not much of a presence was formed . He was simply out - shined by the succulent ladies of the night ; Jennifer Esposito , Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula 's brides . The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably okay . Christopher Plummer gives out a grizzled turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps has fun with his role .
0 I 've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as I was by Ali McGraw 's in this movie . God is she bothersome or what ? ! She says everything in the same tone and is horrible , so horrible in fact that , by contrast , Ryan O'Neal is brilliant . < br /><br />There is not much of a story . He 's rich , she 's wooden , they both have to Sacrifice A Lot for Love . His father is Stonewall Jackson , hers is called by his first name , in case you did n't notice the Difference in The Two of Them that They Overcame in the Name of Love . < br /><br />The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year . John Marley is fine as Wooden 's father , but a Supporting Nomination ? At least Ali did n't win . < br /><br />I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer , but then again , if it were up to me , Katharine Ross would have been in a lot more movies . She 's certainly a better actress than McGraw . < br /><br />I did n't even cry when she got sick , never occured to me to even feel sad . < br /><br />It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones looking like he was about 15 , and the score is good . But this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long , and the sin of that is its not that old , but it feels it .
0 A wealthy Harvard dude falls for a poor Radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father ( Ray Milland).<br /><br />Syrupy , sugary , and most of all , sappy story about a battle of the ' classes ' when rich - kid Ryan O'Neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule . Ali MacGraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while John Marley plays her devout - Catholic father , but no one in the film is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as Harvard 's champion yuppie.<br /><br />Followed 8 ( ! ) years later by ' Oliver 's Story ' .
0 * * * * SPOILER WARNING * * * * < br /><br />Absolutely without a doubt , one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen . Totally impossible to take any of this seriously . It would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it . During the glory days of her program , Carol Burnett and company , who often did take - offs on films , skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine . Carol played Jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from . Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked Ryan O'Neal . The only thing funnier than this bit , is the real film.<br /><br />What a death scene at the end . Jenny really looks like she 's dying alright ... dying for her make - up artist to come in and give her a little color . And of course , we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient 's final moments . The ending scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic . He had plenty to worry about . He never did recover from this .
0 This 1970 hit film has not aged well , but frankly , it was not that good when it was released . Yet , it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War . The plot is pure drivel as it concerns Oliver Barrett IV , a privileged Harvard hockey player , who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri , an antagonistic Vassar music student proud of her working class background . His old - school father naturally disapproves of Jenny , and in a typical act of rebellion , that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie - era , extemporaneous ceremonies . He lands his dream job in New York , but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease . There is a veneer of then - contemporary film - making techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller , but none of that can hide the old - fashioned , cliché - ridden story at its core . The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.<br /><br />Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling . At least the boyish O'Neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach , but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it 's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic façade . John Marley ( two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in " The Godfather " ) does better as Jenny 's plainspoken baker father Phil , as does Ray Milland as the seemingly insensitive Barrett paterfamilias . The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years . The print quality on the DVD is good , though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller . The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal ( upon whose book this movie is based ) conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew  Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones , who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Oliver 's roommates .
0 One of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of Love Story ; one loved it or hated it . But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10 . For me , this movie rated a 4 . There are some beautiful scenes and locations , and Ray Milland turns in a fabulous job as Oliver 's father . But the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story , and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings , at least , not for me . I may be a bit of a snob , but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal -- I still have n't seen Barry Lyndon -- because most of them , but not all , are ruined for me by his presence . The lone exception is What 's Up , Doc ? , in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisand 's goofball protagonist -- and , not coincidentally , he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure ! McGraw and O'Neal tend to mug their lines , rather than act them.<br /><br />This movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career : it was Tommy Lee Jones 's first movie .
0 I love a good sappy love story ( and I 'm a guy ) but when I rented " Love Story " I prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for Ali McGraw 's character.<br /><br />Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes . When we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness I could n't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care . If she did n't die her grating personality would probably have pushed Oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court.<br /><br />People love this movie but it 's one of the worst of the 70 's .
0 Another wonderful Patterson book made into an incredibly awful movie . If the big budget movies do n't work then why make a low budget made for t.v . movie that 's 10 times worse ! I am desperate for a good movie that will do ONE of his books justice !
0 Having not read the novel , I ca n't tell how faithful this film is . The story is typical mystery material : killer targets newlyweds ; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease . Yes , it sounds like a soap opera and that 's exactly how it plays . The first 2/3 are dull , save for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion.<br /><br />Acting is strictly sub par , though it 's hard to blame the actors alone : the screenplay is atrocious . During the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting , but that 's only the last 1/3 . Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element , but there 's only so much he can do with a TV budget and the network censors on his back . He 's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses , though he managed to squeeze in a couple " under the floor " shots during the murders in the club restroom . Unfortunately , as this is made for TV , the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found . Note to producers : give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him.<br /><br />Summing it up : this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by TV standards(watch CSI , instead ) . If you 're in the mood for a film like this , I 've some excellent suggestions : pick up a copy of Dario Argento 's " Deep Red"(my highest recommendation ; superb film ) , " Opera " , or even " Tenebre " . They 're stronger in every category .
0 First To Die 2003<br /><br />I'll admit my mistake first : I did n't realize this was a made for TV movie . I was " thrown off " by the " R " certification . The plot is strong , but the movie is about 40 minutes too long . The direction and continuity were excellent . For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters . The down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the " chick flick " genre . Although there are some violent scenes , none of the violence should call for an " R " rating . There is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes . Actually , there are no sex scenes . Ona Grauer ( who is absolutely beautiful ) , Kristina Copeland , Sonya Salomaa , and Glynis Davies were all guests on the SG-1 series , but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses . Robert Patrick was fantastic , as he usually is and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin . The very talented Megan Gallagher who I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series , was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities . The greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was Tracy Pollan . Aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive , her voice is absolutely annoying . I found myself muting the TV during her dialogue . I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV type of programs . I would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however . Considering I found nothing that would cause censorship , this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on TV , since nothing will be cut out . As a TV movie I would rate this as a 5 out 10 . As a feature film with an " R " certification and such as strong cast , I rate it as a 2 out of ten .
0 The word " 1st " in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims . At least they do n't have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise.<br /><br />1st should refer to : 1st draft of a script ; 1st takes used in each performance in the final film ; 1st edit in post production ; etcetera , etcetera.<br /><br />The movie is not cast too badly , it 's just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate , from the goofy script , to the wooden performances . And while suffering through this cobbled together film , by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery . At 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours.<br /><br />Going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes . Even in the equally awful , Lake Placid , at least the performances Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script , were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie . In 1st to Die , one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead 's suicide.<br /><br />The editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters , who I think ( were never quite told ) is a D.A. She just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation . Obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor 's floor . And no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy.<br /><br />In a word , do n't waste your time with this one . My wife and I wish we did n't . But at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was Mystery Science Theater . " Meanwhile , in Cleveland . . . . " ! ! ! !
0 That 's right , you heard me . I am a huge fan of James Patterson . I own 10 of his books , and I have read the entire series about Lindsey Boxer . In my opinion , the screenwriter should be shot . < br /><br />What right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre ? If I ever thought that Harry Potter was butchered , then Michael O'Hara has proved me wrong . < br /><br />I can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice . To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy : do n't quit your day job .
0 This movie is supposed to be taking place in and around Seattle . The , why is Porteau Cove P - R - O - V - I - N - C - I - A - L Park shown ? Provincial parks are in CANADA , and not the United States . The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with stylus to ' read ' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop . I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device . A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced . We learn half - way into the movie that this woman works in the District Attorney 's office . Then , in the correctional center a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender ! ! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional setting . The director really messed on this one -- this does n't happen in real life . The acting is adequate . The Plot is good . The Cinematography is good . However , the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote .
0 SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!!!<br /><br />I had read the book " 1st to die " and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I watched it . For the most part it did . There were some MINOR differences(location of the last violent scene for instance ) but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies.<br /><br />This may have been a mistake - although the movie was perfectly cast - with Pollen and Bellows especially - I was not that impressed with the book . Or let me take that back . I started off very impressed , gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped . No difference with The movie . Here is why.<br /><br />There is no " payoff " in the book , or the movie . Rarely have I read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it 's final resolution and I had hoped the movie would vary a little.<br /><br />The whole-(he did it , NO she did it , NO they BOTH did it)-was not interesting , not fascinating and more confusing , annoying and depressing then anything else . Add to that , that the love of Lindsay 's life dies at the end(after HER disease cleares and she cries at his grave ) .. and then cut to where she 's contemplating suicide .... then all of a sudden she 's in a fight for her life with the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested .. but it turns out he and the wife were in it together .... HELLO ! ! ! This whole thing has now become " GENERAL HOSPITAL " instead of a good old fashioned thriller . I felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie(I must admit it held my attention nicely -the acting was very good for a TV movie)was hoping it would n't follow the book which it wound up doing.<br /><br />I still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book(or maybe it 's just that I knew what would happen)But I have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all .
0 Well I do n't know where to begin . Obviously this was a made for TV movie , so my expectations were low . I was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour , but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie.<br /><br />And talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives . .. < br /><br />I would go more in depth , but this movie does n't really deserve it . Grade : D+ ( IMDB rating 3/10 )
0 I am usually disappointed by network movies . Even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the TV people . However , this one is the worst of the worst . The screenplay is weak and the acting , especially that of Tracey Pollan is abominable . I 've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting . Pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks . When she tries to express fear , anger or grief , it 's extremely hollow . Because of the overall quality of the production I found it difficult to take it seriously . If you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment . Scary things wo n't scare you , sad things wo n't make you sad , romance wo n't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as I was to see the end arrive . " First to die " says a lot about this movie .
0 Teamo Supremo are three kids , consisting of their leader- Captain Crandall , Rope Girl and Skate Lad , all with their own battlecry ( buza ! chika ! woopa ! ) and outfit and moves . They work for the governor , Kevin , and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game . They lead normal lives as well , and have family and school duties , but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains . The villains all have rather unique and singular traits , such as Mister Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway . From an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil , and often strange , plans to gain power , take revenge etc.<br /><br />The animation itself is quite nice and smooth , but the style appears to be simple on purpose . The backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic . The music is quite nice , and the show is n't too bad altogether , although the style is n't my favourite.<br /><br />The plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous , but after all this is a cartoon and one ca n't blame them for that . However this would not be in the same rank as Fillmore ! or Pepper Ann .
0 I am never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean , Hongkong or even China . Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film . I do n't consider myself as hard - to - please audience as I am , in fact , a fan of indie movies . However this movie shows weak plot and slow pace . I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going . The acting certainly does not make it better . Rainie 's acting is sub par as she ' over - act ' , trying to be perky and cute . Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at . Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused , sad , regretful , extremely reserved character . Overall I find this movie is a disappointment .
0 Almost in the same league as Yonfan 's rather atrocious Color Blossoms , Spider Lillies drives the point home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge , or much in the way of cutting . It 's a Taiwanese film , which in this day and age is becoming a novelty at an alarming pace , but more than that tidbit , we can find very little in the way of the noteworthy here.<br /><br />You should know that ostensibly Spider Lillies is also a lesbian - themed story , but in every aspect this is nothing but a plastic ploy to lure in the easily seduced and gullible . In several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent Taiwan release Eternal Summer . Then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment , now we have the same thing with women . Zero Chou presents , for your non - existent edification , a tale likely to titillate at most a fifteen year old . They managed some of the art house stance , but in the end this results in a most inane , simply uninteresting foray.<br /><br />The Hong Kong angle comes in the form of Isabella Leung ( Bug Me Not , Isabella , Diary ) , here sporting her most butch look yet . Although somewhat likable in her previous jobs , Isabella in Spider Lillies is listless and lacking in most departments . Either her heart was n't into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch did n't quite appeal to her sensibilities.<br /><br />She does a Taipei tattoo artist who 's shy , reclusive and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother , played by John Shen , who thankfully grants the movie its only thespian - related redeeming feature . Isabella 's character , oddly named Takeko but supposedly hailing from Hong Kong , soon hooks up with disaffected youth Jade ( Rainie Yang from fondly - recalled Meteor Garden ) . The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by her parents and life in general . Sure , the grandmother component works well and is touching , but otherwise Jade as a protagonist is just as unmoving as her counterpart Takeko.<br /><br />The two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered angst , with Jade working as a webcam girl while Takeko keeps her father 's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm . Jade also wants to acquire this very design , which leads to Takeko exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal discourse with the spunky Jade.<br /><br />Well , if there 's little discourse to write the homebase about , is at least the intercourse memorable ? In a word , no . They kiss and feign doing the nasty close to the end , but just as Eternal Summer reminded us not long ago , there 's a gulf measured in lightyears between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they 're about to see sexual content.<br /><br />This cynical expectation - building seals Spider Lillies ' fate . With a weak story , ho - hum acting and an overall dearth of relics to take away from the theater with you , this one kind of makes Color Blossoms look good , come to think of it . At least there we got a bit of Teresa Cheung 's mammaries . No , Spider Lillies is no AV masterpiece and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid GLB movie festival.<br /><br />Amazingly for a pseudo - indie release , not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration . That 's just as well , since it makes passing on Spider Lillies much easier . Believe you us , avoid it and you wo n't be missing out on anything good.<br /><br />Rating : * *
0 The BFG is one of Roald Dahl 's most cherished books , but in this animated adaptation the magic just is n't there . This version remains pretty faithful to Dahl 's original story so one ca n't lay the blame on John Hambley 's script . If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation , the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice - overs . One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy , vibrant , fun - filled movie ..... instead , the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch . Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first ! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children 's ' classic.<br /><br />Young orphan Sophie ( voice of Amanda Root ) lives in a none - too - friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers . One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street . The figure realises it has been seen , so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed , placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night . Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country , and fears that he will eat her . But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG ( voice of David Jason ) . The BFG refuses to eat people , instead restricting himself to foul - tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers . However , Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast - every night , as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans . Sophie and the BFG become great friends , and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants . Together they go to the Queen of England ( voice of Angela Thorne ) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man - eating giants . The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.<br /><br />Jason voices the BFG quite well ( one of the few pluses in the film ) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality . The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired , with very little to bring the characters to life . Similarly , the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated - Sophie lacks appeal , and the giants are boringly designed ( and look almost indistinguishable from each other ) . Even the places are uninventive ; Giant Country especially comes up short , being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons . At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy , yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences . Little of Dahl 's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily . One chapter in the book deals with the BFG 's love of " whizzpopping " ( farting ) and is laugh - out - loud hilarious . In the film , the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling . I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest , fun and enjoyment , but what I got was pretty much the opposite ! This one is a failed misfire that simply does n't match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately , therefore , it must go down as one to skip .
0 SEX WISH was actually released ( minus ten minutes of more , ahem , ' extreme ' footage ) here in the UK back in the early days of the video boom , and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case . Strangely enough , the papers brushed this ultra - disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON canned , and the film has been all but forgotten as a result . I jumped at the chance to watch it on a DVD - RW and spent most of the film 's duration with my jaw on the floor . It 's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented , a triple - X take on Michael Winner 's DEATH WISH ( did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned ? ) with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze . If you do n't consider yourself to be squeamish , this may force you to think again . By the time SEX WISH is over , you 'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself . If any film truly deserves the " it 's only a movie , only a movie , only a movie " tag - line , it 's this one.<br /><br />Highlights ( or lowlights ) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her , Harry Reems 's scene - stealing moustache , the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer ( they 'd have won Oscars for their entirely credible performances if the Academy had gone mad ) before the man is castrated for his troubles , and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind - house origins . Do n't say I did n't warn you . If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago , SEX WISH will prove you very , very wrong .
0 After Harry Reems ' teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt ( The Night - Walker ) , Reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians . Meanwhile , Colt , who carries a cane and dresses like a magician , rapes some more women . Eventually , Reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree . Despite being shot on film and marginally nasty , it looks like any other 70 's porno and is ineptly executed . The rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on " Death Wish " is laughable . R. Bolla ( " Cannibal Holocaust " ) plays a cop . Colt , who is usually over - the - top , wigs out in a couple of scenes , but he 's too well behaved for my money . This roughie could have been much rougher .
0 The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating film to watch . Infuriatingly enigmatic , it treats each shot like a work of art . You get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession ; Expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were cranked out in the nineteenth century and mimicking their construction , the camera here hardly ever moves  apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers . Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken . This curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that , even as the story progresses at a snail - like pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed . Unfortunately , for me at least , this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark . I began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of wills.<br /><br />Had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to Western audiences . As it is , there 's an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious ( or possibly dead ) woman that is so repugnant that , while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women ( the users and the used ) it is so over - zealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective . Of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fast - forward button of the remote.<br /><br />For all its problems , the film is definitely a stayer , and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make . Ironically , for a film in which so little happens , the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time . For me , however , once was enough 
0 This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming - Liang for me . It oozes laziness from its every frame . So I 'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either . But some observations:<br /><br />1 . If the premise is drought , why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees ? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film ( in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy , and watermelon the trivial substitute , sex ) . Or it is only a matter of lousy film - making , not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2 . We do n't get to know what had happened to the porn actress , why she is unconscious or , presumably , dead . It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully ( = bombastically ) delivered , but in retrospect , her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick , a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.<br /><br />3 . Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni had n't expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actors.<br /><br />4 . The musical numbers ( recycled from ' The Hole ' ) felt like a secondary - schooler 's idea of artistic counterpointing , executed on that very secondary - school level of skill . If that was the point , the point sucked .
0 I 'll start with what I liked.<br /><br />I really liked the songs , everything about them was great , the costumes , music , lyrics ( as long as the translation was good :) ) , choreography , everything.<br /><br />I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene.<br /><br />But that 's about it.<br /><br />I get it , arty cinema , blablabla , but too much is too much . Too much silence ( it was interesting for an hour , but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time , really ... ) , too much boredom ( no movie should ever be boring , no matter how deep it was to be ! ) , too much porn - like scenes ( I do get it really , I get that they were filming a porn movie there , but really , REALLY , really that is too much ) I truly think , that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way.<br /><br />3 stars for the songs .
0 the acting itself was n't even that bad , since it did't come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind ? the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the mark, .. <br /><br />almost all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of reacting on things that you do n't really attach to any actor in the movie, .. <br /><br />Empty silences, .. In this case , see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical brilliance, .. which just was n't here at all, .. <br /><br />I guess I 'm bitching but shit, .. 2 hours of my time , ..
0 Redundant , everlasting shots , useless shots , useless scenes are what you will find in this film . In other words , it seemed technically poor to me . The musical bits are amateurishly directed ( no synchronization in the would - be dancing , badly post - synchronized , bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time , etc ) . < br /><br />The film is long and boring . Eventually , it makes few point and even less sense . < br /><br />There are some good ideas though . Some of the comic elements are actually efficient , especially the opening scene . However , the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end . < br /><br />The trailer I saw was very dynamic , that is not true for the film . That is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off .
0 The movie is actually too slow . There are some nice images but it can not outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring . You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more . It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is n't fun at all . Though you laugh several times but it 's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun . To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video - clips into the movie . They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50 's but it 's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it 's really sad . Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something , that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that 's it . Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music . The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost . Personally I can not recommend the movie . I believe that art is something that should n't be boring . During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review .
0 they have sex with melons in Asia.<br /><br />okay . first , i doubted that , but after seeing the wayward cloud , i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons , with people dead or alive . no safe sex of course . the ( terrifyingly ugly ) leading man shoots it all into the lady 's mouth after he did the dead lady . never heard of HIV ? guess not.<br /><br />the rest of this movie is mainly boring , but also incredibly revolting . as a matter of fact , in parts it got so disgusting i could n't take my virgin eyes off . sex with dead people ! how gross is that ? and what 's the message behind it all ? we need water , we need melons , we need to be dead to have sex ? sorry , but this stinks !
0 I want to clarify a few things . I am not familiar with Ming - liang Tsai movies , and I am very familiar with art cinema ; I grow up in the seventies times of Goddard , Fellini , Bergman , Bertolucci and many others.<br /><br />Art movies then were really ART ; like paints . People did it to express their inner feelings , not really worried about if other people understand anything . They were beyond commercial values ; just look some old Antonioni ( or early Picasso ) and you will understand.<br /><br />Tian bian yi duo yun ( The Wayward Cloud ) has nothing to do with that . It is an opportunistic movie , intended to fool festival judges and critics , playing many things without saying anything.<br /><br />The story makes no sense . The lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate . A girl in desperation , steal water from the public bathrooms WC . There is also a porno start ( neighbor ) trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with . There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star . The mess ends with a sexual scene ( not pornographic ) that many people feel shocked about , but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence.<br /><br />The two main characters never talk . Sometimes , a musical number 60 style appears and explains ( through a song ) what is happening in characters minds . These video clips , are really welcomed because the previous scene , without dialog or music only people looking at each other , takes sometimes 4 , 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is TOO MUCH . < br /><br />There is also a few bits about " the difficult to make sex without love " , the " selfish mind of the porno industry " . < br /><br />It is obvious , this movie intended ( get away with it ) to fool festival juries and critics . It have a few pseudo - shocking scenes ( within the limits of Taiwan censorship ) and many subjects are open , but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere . < br /><br />These tricks , got the movie a few ( disputed ) important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success ( I see the movie in France and the theater was packed ) . < br /><br />However , please , do not be fooled . There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie . It is boring and empty ; really a fraud to public . Boogie Nights ( which I did not really liked ) , Intimacy and 9 Songs are far better movies .
0 A movie about Vixen ( Erica Gavin ) who has a Mountie husband who she loves ... but she loves sex too ! In the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bed -- including her husband AND brother ! Also there 's a ( tame ) lesbian sequence.<br /><br />This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was ( I believe ) the first critically acclaimed X rated film ever . It was a big hit when it came out . Unfortunately , it does n't date well.<br /><br />It is well - directed and Erica Gavin is just great ( whatever happened to her ) , and it was VERY colorful ... but by today 's standards it 's extremely tame . I 'm surprised it has an NC-17 rating now -- there 's no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all . Also it 's ( sadly ) pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing ( and pretty silly ) . It is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968 . Purportedly I saw the cut version ( which has an R rating ) but I 've heard only a few seconds here and there are missing . < br /><br />Meyer 's next film " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " is much better and dates VERY well . Catch that instead .
0 The line is funnier in England , where , away from Vixen ! 's native America , the word " fanny " has a whole new meaning . Sadly , it 's the only laugh you 'll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny.<br /><br />Oddly unalluring with painted - on eyebrows , Erica Gavin ( Acting ability : zero ) is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother , but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons . As if in revenge , he asks her if she would go with a Shetland pony . Reference is also made to " making it with monkeys " . Gavin 's ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it 's lack of appeal by her seduction dance  which involves a bonfire and a haddock . Personally , I preferred the haddock.<br /><br />For ' 68 this was pretty tame stuff , and belies the controversy it attracted at the time . A character claims to be " getting stoned " , though it 's only on bourbon , and for one of the original " X " certificates , there 's no full frontal nudity . Just six years later we would be getting Timmy Lea and his Confessions , but here we have to make do with topless shots . Only Gavin 's final seduction of her own brother really shocks . Another activity for Vixen is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both . The two women clearly are n't enjoying acting out their scene together , and make a poor effort to disguise it . After Vixen irons out their disharmony , the romantic husband concludes of his wife " I guess she 's got it coming to her!" < br /><br />The only near - worthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of Cuban Communism . It seems out of place with the rest of the film , though is spliced with shots of Gavin 's breasts to rope it in to continuity . This then leads into a vague anti - Vietnam stance , which is commendable , though dropped in the middle of such a frivolous film it seems trite and insensitive , not to say downright tasteless . Incidentally , the part of would - be Communist Niles Brooke is taken by Harrison Page , the same Harrison Page who played Captain Trunk in amusing comedy Sledge Hammer ! Page must be embarrassed by his back catalogue ( Which also includes Meyer 's Beyond The Valley of the Dolls ) , though Meyer apologists would have you believe the terrible dialogue , lousy acting , sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm , but wholly intentional . As a defence , it fails to hold water.<br /><br />The irritating incidental music  a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and muzak used by TV stations when the transmission breaks down  is omnipresent and intrusive ; while even the silly , amateurishly skewed camera angles ca n't generate interest . A wonderful world of jazz saxophones , where women have been " asking for it " , black men  or " shines "  are n't good enough for anyone , and rape is an acceptable form of revenge . Absolutely abysmal .
0 Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should have left well - enough alone when he made " Criminally Insane " 10 years before the release of this god - awful waste of time and effort . The fact that the original " Criminally Insane " was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it ... but instead he opts to use TONS of footage from the original in this one as well , even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence ! Unfortunately , bringing back the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save this one . What little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand - held camcorder ! If this film cost more than $ 100 to make I would be very surprised and I would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount ! Avoid this one and watch the original instead !
0 The first movie is pretty good . This one is pretty bad.<br /><br />Recycles a lot of footage ( including the opening credits and end title ) from Criminally Insane . The new footage , shot on video , really sticks out as poorly done . Scenes lack proper lighting , the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible , there 's even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on.<br /><br />Like all bad sequels , it basically just repeats the story of the first one . Ethel kills everybody who shares her living space , often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants.<br /><br />At least it is only an extra on the DVD for the first one , which also includes the same director 's film Satan 's Black Wedding . Too bad it does n't include the Death Nurse movies though .
0 Due to budget cuts , Ethel Janowski ( again played by Priscilla Alden ) is released from a mental institution ( even though she killed six people ) and delivered to the Hope Bartholomew halfway house . Once there , she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food.<br /><br />HOLY MOLY ! Does this movie suck ! You know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film , apparently filmed off a TV screen . Nick Millard ( under his pseudonym Nick Phillips ) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend . Let 's just say that Millard 's unique style does n't translate well to video . Seriously , I have made home movies with more production value than this . And Millard tries to pull a SILENT NIGHT , DEADLY NIGHT 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film ( which looks like it was taken off a worn VHS copy ) . Alden is again good as Ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage . I mean , at least the first film tried . Here we have no music , weaker effects ( if that is at all possible ) , shaky camera work , horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two VCRs hooked up . Avoid this at all costs !
0 I should have listened . I was warned , and still , I paid money for this , after reading all the reviews , after knowing the original is " so bad it 's good " , and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all , still , even then , I could n't resist . Exactly what happened here ? Part one was Hilarious , it had so much politically incorrectness , and other Crazy , Fat Entertainment , and this one , there just could n't possibly be a worse sequel on God 's green earth , not Basket Case 2 , hell , not even Troll 2 . This is truly the worst sequel in history and that 's really saying something considering the groundbreaking , bottom of the barrel qualities of the original . Criminally Insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad . Shot on Video , zero score , zero entertainment value , 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original , and on top of all that , crazy , fat Ethel has lost a portion of her girth . I mean , honestly , is this some kind of sick joke ? ! ? Thank 's a lot , Nick Milliard . 1/1
0 Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan 's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane , and it 's a good thing too , because when I 've seen a movie and know there 's a sequel ( especially something that 's as obscure as this ) I 'm always curious . I 've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again . Most of CI2 is nothing but " flashbacks " to CI , and footage of Ethel asleep , recalling fond memories , I guess . Thanks to Proposition 13 she 's released from Napa State ( wonder if she got to see The Cramps play while she was there ? ) and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that Ethel promptly takes to calling " granny " . This is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic , and it 's even complete with a couple of " rolls " . Of course Ethel does her thing , which is to dispatch anyone between her and food , especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert . Also , you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink . Guess that 's all a matter of misguided " trust " . If you liked or disliked Criminally Insane , either way there 's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity . One wonders why the makers of this even bothered . 2 out of 10 .
0 During the cheap filmed in video beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II , I wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover . Unfortunately , it was . The story itself is mindlessly simple . Ethel , a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder , is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding . She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another 's soup . Ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food . Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then .... well , you get the idea . If this all sounds like fun , it is n't . This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting . The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store . To make matters worse , half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first Ethel movie , Criminally Insane , which is little better . A VERY poor effort .
0 There are some bad movies out there . Most of them are rather fun . " Criminally Insane 1 " was one of those flicks . So bad that it was enjoyable and had re - watch value to it . " Criminally Insane 2 " has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me , that 's saying a lot because I am not the type of person to say anything is the worst . But trust me , this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long.<br /><br />The movie has a rather incoherent storyline , but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she is n't being fed . Well , you do n't see that in this movie , except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one . The new storyline could have been really funny with Ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there , but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is just atrocious . This literally reminds me of something I shot with friends of mine back when I was 15 . The sound quality is something else as you ca n't understand a word most of the characters are saying . To give an example of how bad it is , go into a New York Subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers , that is what this movie sounds like . Not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood.<br /><br />Now I know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words ca n't describe just how bad this movie is . If you do n't believe me , see it for yourself . 1/10
0 This is the most boring worthless piece of crap I 've ever wasted an hour of my life on . All I can say is thank God it was only an hour . Over half of this ' movie ' is footage from the original " Criminally Insane " . At the very least , I was able to see the highlights from that rare exploitation classic , since for some reality - defying reason my video store only has " Criminally Insane II " ( as it had it , " Crazy Fat Ethel II " ) . But the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home - video acting and backyard filmmaking you 'll ever see . Why is it my video store has this and not the original ? Why does stuff like this actually end up in video stores ? Why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they 've seen its sheer horror ? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why , God , why?<br /><br />Unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits eating an entire candy bar in an excruciatingly slow scene , or said fruit getting hung from the stair railing in an even slower scene , or a character getting stabbed sideways ( do n't ask ) multiple times in the back , or brain cell - murdering monologues about giving poisoned tea to one 's wife and then complaining that all the talk has made one 's own tea go cold , or the mentally - retarded eating fly soup , or just simply want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden : Do n't watch this movie . Repeat : Do NOT watch this movie . Do not rent this movie . If at all possible , do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it . You can still be saved , but it is too late for me now . . .

0 Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor ? The answer is Yes ; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture . The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work.<br /><br />Was this considered a good ' B ' in 1942 ? Hard to imagine . The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast , which contains several well - known faces from the ' 30 's and ' 40 's , such as Warren Hymer , Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong ( I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in " Lives of a Bengal Lancer " , so I was n't counting him).<br /><br />Can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice , get a root canal .
0 If you want to make a movie like this , have the threat be real . Do n't surround your patsy with a bunch of Bonzos . There is no credibility here . The plot is dull and unbelievable . The acting is even worse . I thought that I was watching Arthur Lake ( Dagwood ) who is one of the worst actors in history , when I saw the main character . Oh well , at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad . I do n't care . Do you ? There are all these long scenes set in this austere office ( the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite ) . People talk and smoke and do n't do anything . Most of the action happens in a five minute sequence . After that , it 's over . Do n't bother .
0 Frank Capra 's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film . While it has a few charming moments , and many wonderful performers , Capra 's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story , Broadway Bill ( 1934 ) , is downright shoddy . It is understandable that he would re - use footage from the climactic horse race , which is thrilling . But he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors , then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice , for example , that Ward Bond is 14 years older ! Unless you want to see one of the last appearances of Oliver Hardy , skip this one and watch Broadway Bill instead .
0 ... when he remade Broadway BILL ( 1934 ) as RIDING HIGH ( 1950 ) . Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a screenplay that was ' dated ' in 34 let alone 50 . This sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles , unless they were dead . Though being older did not seem to matter to the Director . Nor that the Cars and Clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s ' standards . Not even ' der Bingel ' singing can redeem this effort.<br /><br />We rated both the original and the remake IMDb Four****Stars . Frank 's touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA - CORN . That did not stop Mr. Capra though . After floundering around the 50 's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY ( 1933 ) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES ( 1961 ) . Again a fine cast was let down on that IMDb Six******Star effort compared too the originals Eight********Stars . Sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead , right after STATE OF THE UNION ( 1948 ) .
0 My grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998 , and so we happily bought the tickets , the popcorn and soda , and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie . When it was over , the audience did n't applauded strongly , I remember that I heard a few people say that they did n't like it at all , I did n't like it , I thought that it was rather stupid , and not worth seeing . Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this , but apart from him , the whole movie was bad , I rarely laughed at the parts in this , I also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed . And what I really thought was bad was making the animals talk , because talking animals only exist in cartoons , in live action movies , they are totally a mutt ! I said that apart from Eddie Murphy 's hysterical twist he brings in , this movie is not worth watching , it is rather stupid.<br /><br />I have seen Eddie Murphy in several of movies and I thought that he was funny in those , I have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie , I also have not seen Eddie Murphy in the really " great " movie , The Adventures of Pluto Nash . This movie is not a movie that I would really recommend that you see , because apart from Eddie Murphy , you probably are not going to like this , especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it ! < br /><br />I'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars .
0 Too bad neither the animals or Eddie Murphy had anything to say worth saying . this movie is just bland.<br /><br />Children 's movie ? Well , if you 're trying to get them to take a nap , then maybe . It 's just 90 minutes of some eye - wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that are n't funny . And the lip - sync'ing makes the old Godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison . Meanwhile , Eddie " Pluto Nash " Murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience . Apparently , he 's trying to modify his old manic persona , but to what ? In short , all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re - imagining , or whatever it is . A town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff . No , really . And Pluto Nash can psycho - babble with them . Things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises.<br /><br />Rent the ' 67 movie . Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons .
0 This is definitely a stupid , bad - taste movie . Eddie Murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom . He is surrounded with his perfect family , full of good family values . If you 're looking for politically correct entertainment , this movie is for you . But if you hate the idea of being the only one not to laugh at obscene gags in a movie - theater full of pop - corn addicts , just flee .
0 Production line collection of fart jokes that pretends ' Babe ' was never made ; the writers clearly hoped that the gimmick of seeing animals talk would be enough to keep the movie going . It 's not . Eddie Murphy sells out yet again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift for understanding the incessant and witless chatter of guinea pigs , tigers , rats , dogs and pigeons . The voice cast is impressive ( Albert Brooks , Julie Kavner , Reni Santoni , John Leguizamo , Garry Shandling , Ellen DeGeneres , Paul Reubens , Brian Doyle - Murray ) but the script is so unimaginative , charmless and depressingly unfunny that the whole thing rattles down the bin chute pretty quickly .
0 ... And that 's why hard to rate . < br /><br />From the adult point of view ( hmm , student point of view : ) ) . i must say i fell nearly asleep here . Sure , there is some laughing scene ( all the credit takes here Eddie ) , but that ca n't save the disney type of script and whole movie , that 's why < br /><br />2 out of 10
0 The movie is bad . Nothing special - just a " kid " movie with no serious thing in it . There is though one reason to watch this for : the animal talk . Some of them are so funny in what they say , you just ca n't stop laughing . So if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying " I 'm Keyser Soze " , or another animal saying " You 're a dead cat walking " , or many other funny one liners , see it . Cause there 's no other good movie to watch it . Vote : 4 out of 10 .
0 This film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside . [ Spoiler ahead ] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends . Whereas Babe ( the original ) bucked the trend of big - budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts , all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat - grinder ( even more so if one could understand their pointless babble ) . Without Eddie Murphy 's zany behavior , this film would be a flop .
0 At first i thought that it was just about Eddie Murphy talking to some stupid animals . I was right . Some people called this movie Eddie Murphy 's comeback ! Who are these people ? Jesus if this is the best he can come up with he can just stay away . What was the story again ? I was so annoyed by all the lame jokes i forgot . I should have walked out on this one .
0 Just what we need ! Another remake of vintage Hollywood cinema , with Eddie Murphy miscast again in his second time around after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR ( 1996 ) ! This shows why we 're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie , ladies and gentlemen ! It has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans . Things can only get more worse , unfortunately . Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of " family " funfare instantly . Even parents and children saw the trailer ad on The Family Channel , which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater . Sad to say this is the more progressive pre - millennium era , but enjoy it while it lasts 'cause things can only get worse with time . More went wrong with the all - new DR . DOLITTLE . It is absolutely plotless , feeling too flat . I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock ! ! ! We need more talented voice - overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who do n't want to declare bankruptcy . I 'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998 . Then again , the original version was n't any good , either . Murphy 's next project could be PATTON if he 's not careful !
0 I have a feeling that Dr. Dolittle was intended for an audience composed entirely of children . I think I would have had a better time if I sat at home and watched a sit - com . My favorite characters in the movie were the pet hamster and the two alley mice .
0 I just did not enjoy this film . But then I loved Babe , a Pig in the City and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way . The animals were not likeable . They were all irritating especially Chris Rock 's guinea pig , but then what could I expect , it 's Chris Rock . I believe I smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines , but that 's it .
0 Everyone involved with this project should be ashamed as to the result of their efforts . Oh . I laughed a coupe of times , but I laughed a couple of times during Schindler 's list also . They really screwed up a good premise .
0 This movie is n't about football at all . It 's about Jesus / GOD ! ! It 's the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus , or pump iron for Jesus . Yeah , Jesus was totally buffed , liked contact sports , and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells . DUHHH ! This movie should have been entitled " Hiking for Jesus , " or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity , and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb . That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help . The recent sports movie " Invincible " was 100 times more inspiring than this was , and Jesus was n't even a factor . It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream.<br /><br />Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda . One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior . But this is simply not true , and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it . The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind . What does he do when he loses ? Does he curse Jesus ? Of course not ! When he loses Jesus is n't responsible . Jesus is only responsible when he wins . And the logic goes round and round and round , and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be , every time ! ! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath . Materialism is not what Jesus taught . I find it odd that most so called " Christians " seem to either forget or ignore this message from their " savior , " especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I 'm standing still.<br /><br />Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world . The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey . I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act .
0 I am a Christian and I say this movie had terrible acting , unreal situations and a completely facade front for Christianity . You might as well watch " Remember the Titans " and at least not mix Christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers . Let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film.<br /><br />1 . The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school . I did not notice a single black student or player in the school . I deal with the White " Christian " Academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation . This is troubling when the movie is about Christianity and Christ changing lives ... how about changing the hearts of segregation ? ( note : I loved the token black coach ; like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black ' Giants ' players . ) < br /><br />2 . The uncritical acclaim by everyone Christian about this movie . Can I get a couple people to say that it was bad acting , bad filming , bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies . If we were to compare this to another football movie , would it have the same charisma and energy ? < br /><br />3 . The half - baked Christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending . If Christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change , then do n't wonder when no one will listen to what Christians have to say . We want to sell Christ as a cure - all . He does n't need sold and He does n't need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles . No wonder everyone considers Christianity to be anti - intellectual with this unreal presentation.<br /><br />I recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people . To most , it will not be . It will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension . Most importantly to me , it is not Christian by any means or stretch . It has values but it falls short as a ' pull - yourself - up - by - the - bootstraps ' message as shallow as positive thinking . If you live alongside people who struggle and/or those in third world living conditions , this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion .
0 I want to state first that I am a Christian ( and that I do work in the film and TV industry ) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard . I 'm all for positive , uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life ( that this is a fallen world and that things do n't always work out ... even for followers of Christ ) . I 'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message ; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face . A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes , exposition aplenty , and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least . I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across . I 'm sure the Kendrick bros . will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well . Maybe they could direct someone else 's screenplay as their next project.<br /><br / > * Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one ( Hoosiers , Field of Dreams , etc ) can inspire in a multitude of ways . If you would be interested in a PG - rated film that inspires , give Steven Soderbergh 's ' King of the Hill ' a look . All truth is God 's truth ...
0 I rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie , since I 'm a big football fan . Boy , was I wrong . This movie is way too religious and preachy and is REALLY unrealistic . This movie pretty much says that if your a Christian you can get anything you want in life easily , like become a great football player ! You do n't become a great football player by becoming Christian and asking God , you do it through practice and hard work . All you got ta do is ask God and he 'll give you anything .... puh - lease . That s not true at all , duh . I laughed several times because of this embarrassment . The only part that was funny was when they were being dumb ( Shultz the cartoonist ? no , the dude that flew over the Atlantic , etc etc .. ) but really this movie was n't that great . I do n't recommend it , especially if you are n't a Christian , lol .
0 This had to be one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and I 'm 64 years old and a football fan . I went expecting to see a football movie . About 10 minutes into it , I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie ( particularly the acting ) could have gotten into a theater . About half way through , I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie . Although I was a little offended ( and can see how some could be VERY offended if they were not Christian ) at being preached to in a movie theater , it was n't that big a deal . It was , however , a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and , above all , the quality of the acting . It is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater . Do I go to church ? Yes . Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie ? No . Would I recommend this movie ? Absolutely not ! ! !
0 This film was bad . Bad acting , bad directing , bad writing . But it was n't bad in a funny way . It was bad in a boring way . I watched " Surface to Air " because I thought it might be a laugh . It was n't . Do n't make the mistake I did . There are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching paint dry or reading the dictionary . Seriously .
0 This movie was way too slow and predictable . I wish i could say more but i can't . If you enjoy action / adventure films , this is not one to see . I'd suggest you go see movies like;Behind Enemy Lines with Owen Wilson and Iron Eagle with Louis Gossett Jr.
0 Awwww .... yes , it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by ABC / Sears and has their home " renovated . " That 's where the humanistic appeal ends . I liked it early in its run , but now this show has become disgustingly excessive.<br /><br />Ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on . The people at Habitat For Humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief . For example , is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom , or have his bed tricked - out with " Low Rider " hydraulics ? Does the mom really need her dilapidated , non - running and rusted out old pick - up truck restored and " pimped " by some of the best customizers in California ? A new one would have done the job quite nicely , and probably for a third of the price . Do people really need a sixty - five inch plasma screen in every room of the house ? And then there 's the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills . Even after the zaniacs at " Makeover " leave , somebody still has earn a living . I doubt the friendly folks down at Social Services will see the humor in all of this largess.<br /><br />This show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for ABC , and a tacit commercial for its sponsors .
0 I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family , only to be sickened to see the house a year later . All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed , the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed , all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down , sprinkler system has been ripped out . It now looks like a disaster area . They do n't even live there any more ... they live " in town " and come out only for the weekend . It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result . The story that we all saw on TV was n't completely the truth ... do n't believe every thing you see and hear .
0 I occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes . I try to enjoy it for it 's basic idea which is helping a needy family , but several factors get in the way for me . Every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted ( which they are ) and tears flow seemingly on cue . The attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me . The fact that everyone who donates something to the house , be it Sears or whoever , has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying . Probably the biggest problem I have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family . Now I know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for Disney / ABC but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house ? Instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights ? Is n't life difficult enough for the average person ? Why do I need help finding things to feel sad about , why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative ? I know what is being done for these families is good , but they are also being used for ratings . You ca n't tell me they are n't being coached sometimes on the crying . I guess when I see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the U.S. could not afford for their children it really bothers me . I ca n't help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of Disney 's money . Instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen TV and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food , clothes , education and medical insurance ? I know so we can be entertained and have a good cry . In terms of money , I feel the same about Oprah . I do n't think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses . Yes her recent reality show did good things , but when she gave $ 30,000 to each losing " contestant " I 'm sitting here thinking ... that 's a years salary for many , many people ... if they 're lucky . Do n't get me started on game shows . So I realize that Extreme Makeover Home Edition is " doing good " , but forgive me if I see it as more self serving than giving of itself . Is there anyone out there that feels similar ?
0 " Extreme Makeover : Home Edition " is yet another ' feel - goody ' , so - called ' heart warming ' , and out - for - ratings show that ABC has had the time to put together.<br /><br />I understand the troubles that these families go through . For that , I am sorry . But would n't you think that putting four wide - screen plasma televisions , three flat - screen desktop computers , an inground pool taking up half of a backyard , and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a BIT too excessive for ANY family ? Sure , these families have been through a lot . Sure , they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had.<br /><br />But honestly , the things that Ty Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood.<br /><br />Another thing that really irks me about this show is how Ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family , or the family 's condition . Telling a wheelchair - bound person that he or she is ' so strong ' , or ' very brave ' really does get old after a while . That may sound rude , but believe me ; watch this show , and you 'll see what I mean.<br /><br />All in all , this show is overrated . If you want to watch it , go ahead . This comment is just a heads - up for what you 'd be watching .
0 I ca n't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear - jerking . For one , it 's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes.<br /><br />How can these families afford to maintain these new mega - houses ? And what about their poor neighbors ? Property taxes must surely increase after this happens . Plus , the noise would annoy me.<br /><br />Second , how excessive can a reality television show become ? It 's practically the same repetitive junk week after week . We 're introduced to a suffering family , they renovate the home , then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the Kleenex boxes.<br /><br />Not to mention how boring the renovation part is . The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like , but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing.<br /><br />"Extreme Makeover : Home Edition " is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat . Skip this one . If you like reality television , " Survivor " is far superior and moving .
0 There is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the US version . The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got . The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should n't be . Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt . I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive . The rather vulgar product placement that takes place , particularly by Sears , is also uncalled for . Rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires , it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home , build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to . Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses .
0 ALIEN LOVE ( As this movie is known in Britain ) is a very strange movie . I don`t mean that it`s an esoteric art house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman , I mean it`s a TVM with swearing , sex , some really good T&A , a bad script and a very retro feel . You can just imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years earlier , though of course he would have cut out the T&A < br /><br />Going back to the bad script , one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially Amanda . Why does she pick up Connie at the bar ? Just so she could meet an alien ? Do you see what I mean about retro ? ET , SHORT CIRCUIT and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here . The storyline continues to follow an ill defined , unconvincing and illogical path < br /><br />That said I did find ALIEN LOVE watchable and not only down to the T&A on display . As a a sci - fi sex comedy it`s much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
0 I guess there are some out there that remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl days on such TV shows as T.J. Hooker , Charles in Charge , and Who 's the Boss ? You perverts , you ! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants . No matter , you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man - eating aliens.<br /><br />There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained . How did she recognize the alien ? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon ? Why did n't the alien eat her ? You get the picture.<br /><br />Before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity , you get to see her in the body of Alex Meneses . This Mexican / Ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash . Stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend , and go on about your business .
0 Now what 's wrong with the actors that took part in that crap ? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise . John Diehl , does anyone remember him in Miami Vice ? Liked him there ... Well , whatever - what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead ? Nothing , and that 's what we get . None of the characters is even likable , the special effects are hilarious ( but not funny ) . The story is a ( very bad ) joke . There is no logic whatsoever for what 's happening . I got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of " Attack of the killer tomatoes " kind of thing . Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet ... <br /><br />If you happen to see it on TV , switch channels - your TV set will be ever thankful .
0 I 've long heard that to get their start in ' legitimate ' films , many behind - the - camera types work on porno films.<br /><br />The people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long.<br /><br />Poorly paced , staged and written , it uses a lot of perfectly good talent ( Diehl , Dorn , Eggert ) badly.<br /><br />Much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere - popping host to the alien creature , but it never crosses the line ... <br /><br />You'll still want to shower afterwards , though .
0 Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this , despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being much bigger stars than her.<br /><br />Basically this is a bit of a spin on the " Alien lands on Earth " film . Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an Alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise . A bit of nudity and partial nudity , a pointless sex scene all feature along the way.<br /><br />The film stumbles through a few obvious set - pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs . I quite liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene.<br /><br />It was fairly obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending , it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien passed to Eggert .
0 The one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel , was i would never get the time I used to watch this , back again . If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn try and earn what must have been then , the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned . Wooden acting , poor special effects , the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b - movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie . The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds , whilst the Police , Military and Joe public do n't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee , dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once . She must obviously be from another planet . Just where I wish I was when this movie was on .
0 This anime series starts out great : Interesting story , exciting events , interesting characters , beautifully rendered and executed . Not everything is explained right away , dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer , enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode . But imagine the disappointment to find that the sci - fi thriller / giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho - babble and quasi - religious preachy exploitation . If you want to hear " You 're OK . It 's good to be you . " after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters ' negative emotions , then this is for you . If you want a good sci - fi flick that is simply fun to watch , forget this one . Both the original , and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me . All that , AND this movie was too preachy .
0 This incredibly overrated anime television series ( 26 episodes , 25 minutes each ) is about a 14-year - old boy ( and two of his girl classmates ) who pilots a giant robot to defend Japan against invading beings called Angels . There is very little explanation given to the Angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times , and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason ( why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans you 're attempting to destroy ? ) . The robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles , but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch . Almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs.<br /><br />Some might be intrigued by fans who mention the ( very few ) symbolic references herein , but that 's all they are - shallow one - liners to religious or philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship . As a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters , who are really nothing more than self - pitying crybabies . The psychology is pathetic , with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like " I hate my father " repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value . It 's no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from time - wasting mediocrity to anger - inducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless , angst - ridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble ( some of which is totally meaningless).<br /><br />I'm not kidding when I say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed . Every day I 'd look at the DVD set sitting on my living room table and say to myself , " Damn , I 've got ta watch the next episode at some point . ( sigh ) I may as well slug through another one tonight . " The real kicker was that the episodes were only 25 minutes long , yet they were somehow able to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening 10 minutes . This is coming from a guy who will happily sit through 150-minute films with glacial pacing , so my criticism of this series is most damning indeed.<br /><br />Never in my entire life have I despised watching a series as much as " Evangelion . " I had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on IMDb , and I certainly was n't going to let it collect dust after spending my hard - earned money . What followed was 10 hours of pure , unmitigated torture . My love / hate relationship with anime is turning into a hate / love relationship after this highly acclaimed disaster.<br /><br />"Evangelion " represents everything anime should NOT be - massive quantities of dull , pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema . The universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable ; and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as " one of mankind 's greatest achievements " is probably the most stupifying comment I 've ever heard on IMDb - and I 've seen some doozies .
0 This has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made . And yes , I was even shown the " End of Evangelion " and that still made me hate it even more . Not to mention the countless rip - offs of this show!<br /><br />I do n't mind psychological and philosophy untertones , but Evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else ! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting . The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka , Misato and Pen - Pen . Other than that , mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers . They need to go to a psyciatric center , not piloting giant robots against aliens called " Angels".<br /><br />Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all . Goes something like this:<br /><br />"Well , there are these robots , and they are really cool because they bleed ( ! ) when they get hurt , but they are not really mecha , but captured angels , so sometimes they go insane and do n't do what the underaged pilots want , and they have to be controlled better ... blah blah blah!" < br /><br />I am so sorry , but I just can not recommend Evangelion to anyone , anime otakus or not . To those who love this series greatly , fine you 're entitled to that opinion , I respect you . But to thoses that have a " out of your mind " obsession to think that every one will like this series , you are more of an egotist.<br /><br />I prefer " Macross " , " Mospeada " , " Run - Dim " and " Robot Taekwon V " myself .
0 Contrary to most other commentators , I deeply hate this series.<br /><br />It starts out looking interesting , with mysterious aliens and giant robots , and I kept my hopes up until the very last episode . At the end of it , I still did n't understand what the alien attacks were all about ( maybe I missed something , who knows ? ) , and realized that I had sat through 26 episodes consisting mainly of the characters ' own self - hating , selfishness and self - pitying . It actually flips between alien / robot fights and these dark , depressing blinking - on - and - off scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout " I hate me / you / it " 10 - 12 times in a row.<br /><br />I ca n't really see either Shinji or Asuka ( two of the main characters ) showing growth or change . ( Nor can I see any of the other characters learning or growing either , for that matter . ) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes , and the feeling did n't change during the last ones . Shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable , and Asuka is such an infuriating know - it - all that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she came into view . Oh , and more than anyone else , these two hate everything , and say it veeeeeeeery often.<br /><br />I'm otherwise a big fan of animé and manga , and never before have I disliked one so much . I read that the series creator / writer wrote this while suffering from a depression , and I can believe that ; it made me depressed to watch it . Is that the aim of this series ? I 'm honestly asking . Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed ? And if suffering from a depression , why just not write a book or biography about it , instead of mixing it up with aliens and mecha 's ? This alien war plot , as far as I could tell , lead to absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />Finally , since I 'm truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead - end plots , I ca n't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good , and how many say they do because they 've been told it is .
0 Kurt Russell ( as Steven Post ) works as a mail - boy for struggling TV station UBC ( that 's United Broadcasting Corporation ) ; he is going nowhere at work , offering ridiculous projects like " Abraham Lincoln 's Doctor 's Dog " to studio executives - because Lincoln , doctors , and dogs are popular . Programming director Joe Flynn ( as Francis X. Wilbanks ) wisely rejects Mr. Russell 's proposals , but has no idea how to pick a hit TV show . His secretary Heather North ( as Jennifer Scott ) , who does double duty as Russell 's girlfriend , has a chimpanzee who bugs the heck out of Russell when he wants to watch TV . Turns out , the monkey watches all the popular shows , and can easily pick the hits . Russell discovers the chimp 's talent , and uses him to advance his own career . Understandably , things gets HAIRY for Russell and the cast!<br /><br />Raffles the chimp ( handled by Frank Lamping ) performs well ; Raffles does look bored and/or distracted during a few scenes , when the chimp is supposed to look interested ; these could have been corrected with re - takes or editing . A mild satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit TV shows ! AND , it 's a monkey who gets a BEER during the commercials ( drinking in a Disney film ) ! A look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun TV actors to recognize and try to place . You could make a drinking game , in honor of Raffles ' beer - guzzling , by guessing actors , and where you 've seen them before . Here 's a start - Hey , is n't that " Dr. Bellows " from " I Dream of Jeannie " ? Down the hatch ! < br /><br / > * * * * The Barefoot Executive ( 1971 ) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell , Joe Flynn , John Ritter
0 I sat through this movie this evening , forcing myself to stick with it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them , because the two leads , Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan , were major film stars of their era and I wanted to see them in " something different , " which this certainly was . They both gave fine performances , but of distasteful characters.<br /><br />Indeed , the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters ( the doctor is , of course , the major exception ) . What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained.<br /><br />This is supposedly based on a work by Jean - Paul Sartre . All I could think was that , if Sartre 's work is anything like this movie , it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating Camus ' masterful novel The Plague , which dealt with a plague in North Africa.<br /><br />A well - acted but uninteresting movie .
0 This movie sucked . The acting sucked , the script sucked , and the movie overall sucked . There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out , but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are . Examples:<br /><br />The heroine 's negative comments about the hero . The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance 's death . The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy 's death as well.<br /><br />Also , all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes . No explanation what - so - ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we did n't feel like we wanted our time back . It was fun to bad - mouth the movie while watching it , so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment . ;-)
0 I 've just visited Russian forum of our TV - channel that had showed this film . Well ... 99 per cent of active Russian audience is disappointed . We wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film . But authors had in mind something else ... :( We are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here . We are proud of all our space dreams , real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand . So I 'd like to ask authors : Where is our LUNOHOD ? And where , the Hell our MIR station ? Ah ? I 'm quite sure , that LUNOHOD events took place much earlier Armstrong 's " walk on Moon " . And to comment numerous technical and science mistakes - I really have no time and enough space here ! Se our constructive critics in Russian forum on www.1tv.ru
0 Shocking!<br /><br />In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive . He was sincere , unpretentious and kindly , he was at ease and looked like well - educated and intellectual person . In this movie I saw a clown ! The actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry . They made a cartoon ! The real Gagarin was someone else ! Do n't believe in this movie!<br /><br />I saw this movie after the movies like " Taming of Fire " and " Apollo 13 " and after reading books " Rockets and People " by Chertok and " Korolev : Myths and Facts " by Golovanov . I was shocked by tiresome scenario , poor acting and producing , and a lots of inexactitudes of " Space Race".<br /><br />The movie is the tedious rendering of well - known in Russia historical facts . A lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated . Some facts and details were perverted . For example , in 1945 Korolev was already not a prisoner ( liberated in 1944 ) , and in 1940 he was already not in Kolyma prison gold mine , but in special prison design bureau . Korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners . But in the movie Korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 ( because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform ) . IMHO , the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they ca n't to make interesting movies .
0 My comment is for the Russian version of Space Race named Bitva za Kosmos ( Battle for Space ) shown on Russia 's First Channel on April 10 - 13 , 2006 . Bad translation could have ruined some details but I doubt it 's the case . The number of factual errors is such that it 's impossible to list them , especially in the first episode ( the development of first missiles ) . Even the U.S. half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions . The audience is not told of any V-2/A-4 launches from the U.S. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number ' UE ' onboard . Apollo 1 is to be launched to the Moon , etc . In the Russian half , each and every person is ludicrous . Korolev is scared of NKVD , Glushko is saboteur and traitor , Mishin is alcoholic etc . Men as functions ; no motivation , no life at all . Uniform and decorations are awful . Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch ( I think this was added specially for Russian version ) .
0 < br /><br />Whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration . If in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between Caucasian and Afro - Americans in Georgia , such as shown in this film , obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there . It is rather hypocritical , to say the least , if everyone adores Halle Berry , Whoopie Goldberg , Beyoncé , Noemi Campbell , Denzel Washington , Will Smith , et . al . , whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides.<br /><br />White grandmother suddenly gets black grand - daughter thrust upon her , only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater . The story is sweet , not lacking tragic overtones , and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of TV films , though the final scene has you guessing ............ will he ? wo n't he ....... ?<br /><br />Gena Rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering , and Louis Gossett is a good match for her ; the little Penny Bae fortunately does not steal the show.<br /><br />A ` nice ' way of relaxing after Sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much , though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it .
0 It 's so sad that Romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows , as superficial and brutal as the " Garcea " series or the " Vacanta mare " child - plays ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu , Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such sub - artisans never presume to claim their shows as " art " . Pintilie , who 40 years ago made a very good movie ( " Duminicä la ora sase " ) followed by another one , nice enough ( " Reconstituirea " ) , tries to declare his film - lenghts " art works " - but , unfortunately , he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression . As such , " Niki Ardelean " offers again a sample of " HOW NOT " - this being about its only merit .
0 This guy has no idea of cinema . Okay , it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth , and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship . This all is very good , but look carefully : HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB ! The scenes are unbalanced , without proper start and and , with a disordered content and full of emptiness . He has nothing to say about the subject , so he over - licitates with violence , nakedness and gutter language . How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art ? Why do n't they let him succumb in piece ?
0 Yes , he is ! ... No , not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies . Pintilie IS THE naked " emperor " - so to speak ... <br /><br />It 's big time for someone to state the truth . This impostor is a voyeur , a brat locked in an old man 's body . His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever . It is 100 % visual perversion : he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies . And if he does this in front of the audience , he might eve get a hard - on ! Did you know that , on the set of " Niki Ardelean " , he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss , by telling her : " Oh , Coca , how I wanna f * * * you ! " ? She is a great lady , very decent and sensitive , and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction ! And , as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences , so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities " works of art " ! Will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all ?
0 Terminus Paradis was exceptional , but " Niki ardelean " comes too late . We already have enough of this and we want something new.<br /><br />Big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time , not behind . Why people see Romania only as a postrevolutionary country?<br /><br />We are just born not reincarnated , and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times . Most people do nt remember or do nt want to remember , and the new generation of movie consumers do nt understand a bit . This should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi ! Maybe younger directors should make the move .
0 this movie begins with an ordinary funeral ... and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching , and started skipping scenes . it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance , unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction . well , i ai n't one of the dark kids from Southpark , i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story , i wo n't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral .. my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals , perhaps she might have enjoyed this " movie " .
0 I saw this movie twice . I ca n't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie . I 'm also a movie / theatre director and I know what I speak . This is not Romania anymore , but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September . No story , no plot , nothing . No conclusion , no message , nothing profound , nothing hidden . Just empty images.<br /><br />What most of Romanians do n't know , this movie is for the french viewers , not for us . They really believe that is the reality in Romania . Also for teenagers . Pintilie should stop making movies . I do n't really know if we can call this a movie , maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we 've got such an image in Europe . This WAS a reality , but is n't anymore . A good friend of mine from the Brithish embassy said : " You have no idea what a long way Romanian people walked from Ceausescu " .
0 I find it rather useless to comment on this " movie " for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon . It 's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it . But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... < br /><br />Filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other Romanian " movie " directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists to depict the so called " Romanian reality " following the Communist era ( 1990 to present days).<br /><br />Under no circumstances recommended for people outside Romania as for the others ( who lately find amateurish camera , lack of plot , lack of directorial / actors 's quality etc , noise etc . as being trendy and even art - like ) : watch & enjoy this " movie " ( as I know you will ) but do the other well intentioned IMDb members a favor , do n't write an online review for it will misguide , irritate and in the end waste their time.<br /><br />On the other hand this movie ( among others ) has some value whatsoever , an educational one for it sets the example for : " How NOT to make a movie . "
0 It 's very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies . They get worse every time . Niki and Flo ( 2003 ) is a depressing stab at the camera . It 's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in Romania , the worst of them get to be sent abroad ( e.g. Chicago International Film Festival ) . This movie without a plot , acting or script is a waste of time and money . Score : 0.02 out of 10 .
0 Was there a single positive to this film ? Critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made . No damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example.<br /><br />And I may have missed something , but was n't Super Mario Bros. 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before ? Well if that IS the case , and I did not miss anything ... how did Fred Savage 's character , and even the girl , know so much about the game already ? We 're talking things that some people do n't know about by their second or third play - through.<br /><br />Beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself . Nothing here is honestly very memorable . The kid was n't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed . A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced . On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points . The characters are bland and completely uninteresting , the ' Wizard ' ( the youngest child ) is a very silent , completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma . It is n't that this is unrealistic , it 's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes.<br /><br />Honestly , the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature . If you grew up with this movie you 're going to like it whether it was good or not . It was about kids playing video games , and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well . But unless you loved it as a kid there just is n't anything that 's going to keep you interested , and very little that will prevent you from turning it off.<br /><br />No sir , I did n't like it .
0 This is a review of The Wizard , not to be confused with The Wiz , or Mr. Wizard . The Wizard is a late - eighties film about a seriously silent boy 's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits . The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz , and Mr. Wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />Now that we 've gotten all that out of the way , let me say this : there 's really no reason to see this movie . It 's simply a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove , the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3 . I use the word " designed " in the loosest sense possible , because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played Nintendo , and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother . Maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together , they 'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.<br /><br />I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you . It sure has n't been for me . In fact , I think I might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it . Next time you 're at the video store and you see the The Wiz , The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row , give them all a miss and play Duck Hunt instead .
0 What a great actor to have in such an awful story ... <br /><br />The film and its production , however , is quite good , even though set in London but with exteriors in Bristol . No matter  see one cathedral , you 've seen 'em all , sort of.<br /><br />The story however ... is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything , should he so wish . With just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis , the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy , a teenager and finally as a man ; so much so , in fact , that he exacts vengeance at will , literally . Over time , he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it!<br /><br />The trouble with the narrative , however , is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi - religious claptrap to produce a hodge - podge theory about it all . Mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and I 'm afraid Richard Burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing . His very best scene , however , is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home : sharp , witty and deadly dialog , delivered as only Burton could.<br /><br />A good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better , though , beginning with Lino Ventura , whom I last saw in Garde A Vu ( 1981 ) , as Inspector Brunel ; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner ; the much under - rated Lee Remick as Dr Zonfeld ; Derek Jacobi as a publisher , Towney , and a few other well known character actors.<br /><br />I liked the way the story was presented , as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar ( Richard Burton ) , the writer with the killer disposition . Up till that point , it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick . Still , it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would - be murderer.<br /><br />Then , they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes . If you want a clue about what that is , think Samson and Delilah ( 1949 ) , from the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille , and how Samson got the bad guys in the end . And , the very last scene is just plain stupid . Why ? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar 's rampaging could have been stopped , absolutely.<br /><br />Shame , actually , because this could have been a lot better story and movie . I guess Burton really needed the money.<br /><br />If you 're Burton fan , then spend the time to see that scene I mentioned above . Otherwise , do n't bother .
0 If 1977 's " Exorcist II : The Heretic " did him no favors , it 's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire Richard Burton saw in this drab exercise in non - thrills . You 've seen it all before : Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind ( and you thought " Carrie " had no impact on Hollywood ! ) . Though adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway , " Medusa " plays like recycled goods , though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid ( if typical ) . Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor , but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak . Burton is hammy but weary ... not even telekinesis could save him at this point . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 It was pointed out in a now deleted post from another IMDb user that anyone who might see " The Medusa Touch " should be warned about a scene that 's eerily reminiscent of the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in NYC . But I hope anyone reading this will consider this warning . Despite an interesting pedigree ( producer Elliott Kastner produced " Harper " and " The Long Goodbye " ; co - producer Arnon Milchan co - produced the Oscar - nominated " L.A. Confidential " and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for " Gandhi " ) and an international cast , I found " The Medusa Touch " to be a heavy - handed , unintentional laugh riot . It was a poorly directed , horribly written and acted mess . It tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre . The movie fails on many counts . Please consider " Carrie " and the underrated " The Fury " ( both directed by Brian DePalma ) . They were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter .
0 The Last Station , director Michael Hoffman 's melodrama about the last months in the life of Leo Tolstoy , begins with fog and sleep . Tolstoy ( Christopher Plummer ) lives with his family in a compound at Yasnaya Polyana , taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his " movement " , people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism , vegetarianism , sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away . His wife , Sophia ( Helen Mirren ) wars openly with the head of his movement Chertkov ( Paul Giamatti ) , who she claims in his efforts to convince Tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the Russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death . Observing all of this is Tolstoy 's new steward , Bulgakov ( James McAvoy ) , a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife.<br /><br />Hoffman 's script , which is based on the novel by Jay Parini , quite often veers itself into confused territory , building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately do n't resolve themselves in any satisfying way . The scope of the film is grand , and its story should reverberate just as Tolstoy , whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the Bolsheviks ' and those of pacifists like Ghandi . It unfortunately does n't , it 's un - unpickable , building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness . The three - way relationship between the Church , the faithful Sophia and the unbelieving Tolstoy , for example , is referenced often . In the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up , but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy . There are a ton of details in the film , but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered , overburdened , energetic but unfortunately pointless.<br /><br />At its heart is the love story between Sophia and Tolstoy , and that story , as baffling and cramped as it is , is the reason to watch the film . Mirren and Plummer are , unsurprisingly , the best things in the film . Plummer 's Tolstoy is vague , at once confused and resolute , apprehensive and full of joy and certainty . Mirren 's Sophia is in full panic , in a righteous lather , forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time , his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas . They 're great performances , all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple 's place in history and the script 's ability to support that , both Sophia and Tolstoy seem willed into the film by Mirren and Plummer alone , both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there . Giammati and McAvoy , both talented actors , are unable to do the same and Giamatti 's Chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief ( and not both at once , either ) but rather a cipher , a stand - in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses . The scope of this thing never boils down to anything , it hitches along , getting by on the strength of Plummer and Mirren and not much else . It 's interesting and pretty , but ultimately unrewarding . 4.5/10
0 The animation was good , the imagery was good , although not totally original , however , the story was too long , way too confusing , and over the top dramatic . After about an hour I could n't wait to get it over with . With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really was n't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies . If you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it , but frankly , I 've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell . Go rent a Miyazaki film and watch it twice , you 'll get way more out of it .
0 I saw this movie two weeks ago at the " festival des nouvelles images du Japon " in Paris . Though i was n't expecting much from it , i have to say i 've been disappointed just like many people in the audience ... if i wanted to sum up how i felt , i 'd say i 've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end . Of course it 's silly . But i could n't help it . The stories are quite different , but the worlds pictured are very much alike . And from this point of view , " a tree of palme " definitely ca n't stand the comparison with Miyazaki 's masterworks . Even if it 's quite good technically , boredom remains ... in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it . I rated it 2 out of 10 ( a bit harsh , i guess it deserves 3 or 4 )
0 The teasers for Tree of Palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning , then immediately start raving about the animation . I should have known what that meant.<br /><br />The main character , Palme , is a good example of the whole movie 's problem . One minute , Palme is a humble hero in search of himself , the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of.<br /><br />Like all of the characters in the movie , Palme is poorly defined . You do not bond with the characters at all , although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls . It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters ' motivations and personalities.<br /><br />New , useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie . The writer seriously needed to streamline his story . Perhaps he was trying to be epic , but it was simply too much information for a two - hour movie . However I ca n't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a TV series or graphic novel.<br /><br />In the last five minutes of the movie , I simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters , the relationships , and the whole plot was . I touched my companion and he started cracking up too , as did a young man seated behind us . We tried so hard to control ourselves , but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.<br /><br />On the bright side , the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs . The animation almost guides you ; when you do n't care about the characters , it tells you how to feel .
0 And a self - admitted one to boot . At one point the doctor 's assistant refers to himself as Igor.<br /><br />Working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions , this movie does n't spend enough time exploring the premise . Most of the screen time is split between girlfriend - in - a - coma domestic strife and chasing down the brain donor 's killer . It attempts to be a sci - fi / drama / thriller but fails to deliver on any of the three.<br /><br />As a Frankenstein remake this one is missing everything that made the original good . Nobody calls the doctor insane or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital . The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye and the amazing computer that makes it happen is n't even shown . When the experiment works there is no praise , and when it starts going wrong there is little reaction.<br /><br />Any suspense over who the killer might be is shattered by progressively showing him in the same room with all of the possible suspects . Finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and interviewing one person.<br /><br />San Francisco as a setting is both overplayed and underused . The opening sequence hammers home the point that this is happening in SF , a cable car plays a significant role , the leads live in a hilltop Victorian , Pier 39 makes an appearance , and the final showdown happens at Golden Gate Park . More specifically along ten feet of cliff side at the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times . Once the obvious scenery bases are rounded no other attempt is made to explore the city.<br /><br />The acting is the only saving grace here . Keir Dullea shows a good range and pulls off a couple of genuinely emotional scenes . Suzanna Love portrays recovery from a coma well . Tony Curtis only gets a handful of lines and twice as many evil guy stares with most of the Frankenscience explained away by his assistant . The little blond kid hits his cues fairly well also.<br /><br />I also gave it one extra star for the scene where the husband drives south from the bridge , it cuts to a U - turn in an unrelated parking lot , and then he 's instantly back on the bridge driving north . It takes a whole lot of something - bravery , ignorance , deadlines - to try and slip that one by the viewer during the one single car chase .
0 I ca n't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did . I guess it 's all part of the dumbing down of America . Personally , like David Spade said , I liked this show better when it went by its original title - " Seinfeld " . What bothers me the most about this show , aside from the obvious , base sense of " humor " , and general smuttiness , is the pretentious way the episodes are titled . Truly great shows are still funny after many , repeated viewings , like , " the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized " , on the " Dick Van Dyke Show " , or " the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory . " In other words , it 's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers . That the writers and producers of " Friends " would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes , themselves , in such a fashion , before anyone 's even had a chance to even see it a second time , speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers , but , also , of the stultified minds of their viewers.<br /><br />You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card - like Neverland , full of greeting card sentiment . The true meaning of friendship ? I want to be a friend ? I want to live in Manhattan ? Wake Up . These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors , but they somehow manage to live in $ 4000/mo . apartments ? Get real . All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas , good luck with all of that . That New York does n't exist for anyone making less than a serious six - figure income . But , good luck with all of that , anyway . Now , shut - up and pass the Soma .
0 TV does influence society ... just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted . Besides , real people who look as good as these people do do n't have any problems.<br /><br />Besides , does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living ? NBC just loves to insult the viewer 's intelligence , even if they 're just around Gump 's level . I know a person who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one - bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2200 a month in rent . < br /><br />I'd like to see a show called Phriends , where it 's six ugly nobodies in dead - end jobs , living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week ... and then the landlord jacks up the rent . Now THAT I would watch .
0 I have a severe problem with this show , several actually . A simple list will suffice for now , I 'll go into more depth later on : superficial characters , a laugh - track and boring humour.<br /><br />If you do n't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior ( as if you see anything in this show I did n't ) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I 'll summarize : Friends sucks , not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new , good shows ( Arrested Development , Dexter etc . ) . Friends is as much to blame for reality TV , " Two And A Half Men " and " The King Of Queens " as the television executives . Now then , on with the review.<br /><br />These characters have no soul , they are exactly the same in every way ( outside of gender and hair colour ) . They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies . Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it ? Why is n't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel 's enemy ? Why does n't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously ? Oh right , cause he 's the dumb one and he 's comfortable with that . This is the curse of having perfect characters : lasting conflict and ( god forbid ) personality becomes an impossibility.<br /><br />The laugh - track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born . Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny . How can I make such a broad generalization ? When a show that claims to be " comedy " requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it . Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks . Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity ( see The Office , Arrested Development).<br /><br />This leads to my next point : the humour is boring . There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous ( without a laugh - track apparently ) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws . So what if Monica dated a 17 year old ? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing is n't right and breaks up with him . There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution . Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him . That would be great , it would be like a custody battle ! So now I 've provided evidence for my position . Many of my friends love this show because they have n't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development , many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development . < br /><br />I have watched very little of " Friends " in my life , but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show , in my opinion , completely unwatchable . If you 've read this far , thank you , and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned .
0 I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has . Have n't said that Friends was , at best an ' average ' sitcom , and not as great as others have made out . Let 's face it , if it was n't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette , David Schwimmer , Matthew Perry , Lisa Kudrow , Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc , then who knows whether this show would 've lasted as long as it has done . I very much doubt that . Although as the series progressed , Friends got more progressively predictable , lame and boring that I could n't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight , nor of who was sleeping with whom . And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny . And even when it had all these A - list Hollywood actors from the movie world , I still did n't bother to tune in . The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending , well it was predictable to say the least.<br /><br />What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons , whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three , four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good . The show should 've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries . In truth , as much as the series waned , it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves , not the other way round . < br /><br />When it ended in 2004 , I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom . Now , there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon . And yet , I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever .
0 It is quite simple . Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults , with unsophisticated sense of humour.<br /><br />It is also painfully obvious that towards the end , they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons , most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld 's 9 season run . The trouble with this is , Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing , Friends had ( and I 'm being very generous here ) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.<br /><br />It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that were n't that good so start with , then got worse at the 100th time you saw them . I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly . It is truly awful .
0 This is the worst show . Buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing . Even Sesame Street has better humor and more adult than friends " Friends " may be the worst thing I 've ever seen on television and I 've been sitting in front of the tube observing Friends " simply does not stack up well to other , contemporary series . It lacks the smartness of " Seinfeld " and the wonderful self - ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of " Frasier " . The characters in " Friends " seem designed to make them repellant dullards . This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.<br /><br />The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort . The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so . ( It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of " Friends " . )
0 This movie is just plain bad . Weak story , weak directing and below average acting . The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well known internet provider . It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that , advertising . This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this.<br /><br />Do not watch this , it not worth your time .
0 I do n't believe they made this film . Completely unnecessary . The first film was okay . But there was no need for a sequel , certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film . This film feels like a soap - opera . The writing is so bad , it 's utterly simple . The jokes do n't come across , the acting is flat , it 's shot like a soap , it lacks any direction . The first film had a good emotional spine behind it . Every character had a little arc . It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film . But this time around , there is no cohesive story - line . The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens . One good thing : the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire 's son is pretty well cast . That was their one moment of creative success on this film . I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to ' Team Spirit 2 ' but please God , do n't let them make a third feature installment ...
0 Awful movie . It 's a shame that a few of Flanders 's top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor film.<br /><br />There is barely something changed since the first movie and the TV series : same actors , same prototype characters , same scenario ( emotional complications , the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tip - top after a predictable grand finale ) . Another constant fact in the work of Jan Verheyen is the exaggerated product placement ( company logo 's on the team 's shirt and along side the pitch OK but two times a commercial ( by one of the characters ) about an internet provider is just over the top.<br /><br />Meanwhile , rumour has it about the making of a second series for Flanders commercial TV station ' VTM ' ( coincidental or not , the station where Jan Verheyen is programmation manager since a few months)<br /><br />To conclude ... and the golden raspberry award for worst foreign movie goes to ... Team Spirit 2
0 This movie is bizarre . Better put , it 's " freakin ' weird " . I could give you a plot summary , or some hoity toity analysis , but I would consider it a waste of your time . All anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters , one incestuous relationship , homicide , post mortem mutilation , and one really disturbing infatuation . At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself , but not in a good way like after " Pulp Fiction " or " Fight Club " . It 's like you 're a teenager ( or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager)and have just done something you A : wish you had n't done , and B : hope to the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about . And nobody likes that . My advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth , just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch " Kazaam"(yes , I would rather watch " Kazaam " than " Murderous Maids " , read into it what you want ) .
0 Anurag Basu who co - directed the flop KUCCH TO HAI made his debut in this film < br /><br />The film was ahead of it 's times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to HAWAS which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better business < br /><br />The movie starts off well , Malika 's guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with Emraan- Malika is too crude / vulgar < br /><br />The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well handled and the twist in the tale where Ashmith confronts Emraan is brilliant < br /><br />The pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of Emraan is n't fully convincing < br /><br />Also the cop track seems half baked < br /><br />The finale is too filmy too < br /><br />Direction by Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner , all songs were fab Camera - work was stunning < br /><br />Emraan played his naughty streak very well , this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb Ashmith too was good in his role for once , He did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too Malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half but her dial delivery was at times not up to the mark Sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is okay
0 This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful . Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere , Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane . They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses . < br /><br />Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful , though it could n't catch up with the original . It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers , where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show . Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer . In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors . Though the film bombed at the box office , the actors got the undue recognition . In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film . < br /><br />All said , this is not a family film , so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family .
0 If you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters , this is the one . The acting is superb , both from John Cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom , as the saying goes , they REALLY ARE out to get , and from Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue . Big mistake , but since they 're both amoral mobsters , and misogynistic bastards to boot , it 's hard to decide whom to root for LESS . Only writer / director Elaine May could have gotten away with this one . I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD , he disclosed that the two stars had " very different ideas " about the script , that the director was nearly impossible to work with , that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him , that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting , and so on . This mood of one big VERY dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen .
0 ( When will I ever learn- ? ) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane . Please allow me to vent my spleen ... <br /><br />I will admit : the setting , presumably New York City , has never been so downright ugly and unappealing . I am reminded that the 70 's was a bad decade for men 's fashion and automobiles . And all the smoking- ! If the plan was to cheapen the characters , it succeeded.<br /><br />For a film to work ( at least , in my simple estimation ) , there has to be at least ONE sympathetic character . Only Ned Beaty came close , and I could not wait for him to finish off Nicky . If a stray shot had struck Mikey , well , it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most.<br /><br />I ca n't remember when I detested a film as strongly . I suppose I 'm a rube who does n't dig " art " flicks . Oh , well .
0 Very outdated film with awful , cliché - ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction . In addition , Cassavetes and Falk overact constantly . A pseudo " good movie " . It takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is . The first scene is a total bore , filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges . The sound is horrible . Camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters . No poetry , no subtle psychology , no interesting shots . The actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages . Very cheap , indeed . ( one exception : Ned Beattie"s nice and simple way of playing the hit man ) .
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * Let 's start with the " good " of this film -- the serviceable acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton . The rest of the acting is awful ( this is n't aided by the atrocious script ) . The worst culprit is the villain , Buntao , the head of an Asian crime syndicate ( played by Frans Tumbuan ) . I was laughing my head off as he was expressing his " fury " over having lost a bunch of money ; horrid performance . Patrick Muldoon is n't much better , and his " it 's a hostile takeover " line ( that 's the remainder of the title of this film ) was delivered about as badly as one could do it . There are no other main characters , but no other actor / actress distinguished him / herself in this film . We next come to the plot . This should tell you all you need to know : In the original " Rage and Honor , " Cynthia Rothrock , who plays Chris Fairchild , was a teacher in the inner city . Now , she 's a C.I.A. agent ( or was it some other governmental agency -- sorry , but this film was so bad that I do n't even remember ) . Hmmm ... I can imagine what that C.I.A. application process was like . Interviewer : What past job experience do you have ? Chris : I was a teacher . Interviewer : Okay ; you 're hired ! I only give it a " 2 " because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end ( though we know that Tommy ( Muldoon ) , the secret villain , will be caught ) .
0 Two years ago at Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth 's directing debut - Haiku Tunnel . So I was looking forward to his brother ( and frequent collaborator ) Jacob 's , The Best Thief in the World . This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower - class area of New York . The movie is not without its poignant moments . But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious : Life can be very difficult for some people . And life is n't fair.<br /><br />More subtle , and more important , is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti - social behavior they may spawn , these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity . We can recoil at their language and their living conditions , but we are can not discount their intent . And in fact , their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate . Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood , and his compassion for the people is evident throughout.<br /><br />Having said all this , The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws ( including the title ) . The characters are n't very believable . The writing is uneven . And the plot - line is barely discernible . And for many the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes . To each his own : But while I do n't question the potential realism of this phenomenon , it pains me to see 5-year - old children mf'ing and talking about having sex with a line - up of women . It 's unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest .
0 We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes : an idée reçue few would challenge . Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film . A sweet , earnest , though tongue - tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy . They ponder the results . He mumbles some more , she composes another eulogy , etc . , etc.<br /><br />The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad , but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring .
0 I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people , being killed , taking drugs and talking trash.<br /><br />I do n't agree with that because the film actually had more to it , but it a way , I can see what this person is trying to say : this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with.<br /><br />It is self - indulgent Stone at his best . He really wanted to show , not only how war leads to death , but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive . Unfortunately , the film seems to over " glorify " this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne , grand - standing , Oscar - hunting " let 's create an enduring image " for my liking.<br /><br />The problem I have with Stone and other film - makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept : depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war . We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq . In case you 're missing the point , let me put it to you bluntly : if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers , would you think it was an unjust war ? If that fact alone does n't convince you that it was an unjust war , then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance . < br /><br />Personally , I do not support America 's decision to go to war in Vietnam , but i certainly do n't subscribe to the " this war is wrong because people died and suffered " theory . I do n't think that motivations are always wrong by default , just because war in itself is terrible.<br /><br />This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big " twist " was a bit stupid . However , this is not Stones first oddball departure . Wall street was a magnificent film , up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful " wrong turn . " JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well.<br /><br />But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around . And this is why i gave it such a low mark . It was virtually story - less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy .
0 Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing . Oliver Stone 's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it 's laughable . While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10 + year span of US military involvement in Vietnam , to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame ( weeks ) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war . In Platoon , the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two : US soldiers murdering civilians , US Soldiers raping civilians , a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant , a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant , US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire , 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon . For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace . Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers ( the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam ) and HBO 's A Bright Shining Lie .
0 I 'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam , and WERE NEVER THERE . This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers . Yes , bad things do ( and did ) happen , but in general the people there are just like you and me . They have morals , they are not killing machines , they do not all do drugs . Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam , not the rule . They happened far more infrequently than the " hype " would lead you believe . Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath , but are based as much in reality as Star Wars . If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam , do yourself a favour and learn the truth . Fact : the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did . Fact : the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did , and they were WELCOMED when they came home . The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect ; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint , no one could have asked for more from our soldiers , and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of " mostly true " fiction is the way things really were there .
0 Oh my , this was the worst reunion movie I have ever seen . ( That is saying a lot . ) I am ashamed of watching.<br /><br />What happened in the script meetings ? " Ooooooh , I know ! Let 's have two stud muffins fall madly in love with the Most - Annoying - Character - Since - Cousin - Oliver . " " Yeah , that 'll be cool!" < br /><br />Even for sitcoms , this was the most implausible plot since Ron Popeil starting spray painting bald men .
0 A group of us watched this film are were really disgusted . We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo was n't on ( it 's not like the writers / producers could do anything about that ) . The writing was poor , the script was sub - par . What REALLY annoyed us : 1 . When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie , they did n't just leave they put up with that stupid ( and ultimately degrading ) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys , not because they really wanted Natalie . 2 . Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion , Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him ? ( and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy , it 's as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film ) . 3 . Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children , she blissfully agrees with him .
0 I tried . I really did . I thought that maybe , if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance , I could enjoy his movie . I know that after seeing O FANTASMA I felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core , but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor , so I was like , " What the hell . At least you did n't pay 10 dollars at the Quad . Give it a shot." < br /><br />Sometimes it 's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain . I often wonder if it would n't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it . On other occasions , I often think that the world is really flat and that if I sail away far enough , I will not only get away from it all , but fall clear over , and that some evil , Lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995 , still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of me.<br /><br />Is there a reason for Odete ? I 'd say not at all ... just that maybe her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness ( one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake ) look not only creepy , but flat - out sick to the bone . She first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend ( in shrieking hysterics ) because she wants a child and he believes they 're too young . She later crashes a funeral of a gay man , and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him , she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead man 's mother and lover in the sickest of ways . Oh , of course , she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one , but a good three times on his grave . And there 's this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes " Pedro " which sums up some weak - as - bad - tea explanation that love knows no gender . Or something.<br /><br />I'd say she 's as nuts as a can of cashews , unsalted . But then again , so 's the director . And me , for taking a chance on this . At least the men look good . Other than that ... not much else to see here .
0 I was n't really going to comment , but then I figured I had something to say . I saw this film two days ago and , although I think it 's not a complete waste of time ( it might have been of money though , for the producers ) , it 's obvious it has serious problems . It 's got really good cinematography and ( little but ) nice music . A lot has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira but , let 's be honest , over what ? She is not really an actress an she balances permanently between over - acting and preposterous under - acting . Her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other film : crazy ? sad ? childlike ? an impostor ? no one knows , fellows . So she 's kinda sorta dictating the rules here.<br /><br />I thought this film was also a good example of the problem most Portuguese films suffer from : soundtrack . There is a permanent NO to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue . People in other countries may think Portugal is the noisiest of places . What thrilled me though , was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it did n't necessarily solve the syndrome . Bad dubbing too , I must say . It 's strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene , when the first character speaks is : it 's dubbed . And all this to say that the film has technical problems.<br /><br />It also has script problems . It tries to be classical from the first to the last scene . There was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows . The writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but ... it shows ! ! All dialog is too expositive and there is n't one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film . It 's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant.<br /><br />Not that the film is a total mess , I must stress . I just think the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to concentrate on the bad ones.<br /><br />Direction brings little to the weak screenplay . All shots are classical and un - innovative , but their beautiful . Great work from Rui Poças , by the way.<br /><br />Now , what I think was THE problem , the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously : The guy who plays the guy who DIES is obviously not an actor . Actually , It 's a rather important role and I ca n't see why non - actors are cast for such parts . This guy is neither an actor nor a good - looking man . Which means the whole film rolls down the mountain , since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he 's gone , and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss , when all we see of this character is apathy . Too bad . The world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers . The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after they 's gone . The world is full of great films and also of not that great films . C'est la vie !
0 Lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous Zhang Ziyi , in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 China , just prior to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria , and reunites with a former lover who is now working for Japan . Every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director Ye Lou 's somnambulist directorial style . Characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes , saying nothing , hand - held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to , edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy . We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses , only silence and static shots of lovers who do n't speak , who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy . A very sleep inducing film .
0 Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie : Too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing ( that the screen is cut off ) , because there seems to be important actions going on , but you can not see them . There is anyway already too much confusion in the movie , so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals . < br /><br />I like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work . I can handle deep and slow movies . But this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.<br /><br />Nothing to get attached to , to any of the characters , because they are not worked out well enough . To work out characters more is needed , than just minute long face shots , at least with this set of script+director+actors.<br /><br />I wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors . < br /><br />I will stay away from films both written and directed by Le You for sure in the future . < br /><br />What an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history , and for someone who spent time in Shanghai .
0 I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times . In addition , I 'm also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter . However , after watching it , I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The movie 's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous . The director lingered on certain scenes for much too long . There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers . There was barely any dialogue . Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting . At the end of the movie , you did n't feel any compassion for the characters . This movie was lacking in everything . The script was weak , the acting was poor , and the editing was non - existent . The director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably . A good movie is one in which captures your attention , maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by . This movie felt as though it would never end . Do n't waste your money on this movie .
0 I am a huge Ziyi Zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to Purple Butterfly . As much as I wanted to like this movie , I have to agree with many others who have commented on it . It is very confusing and also extremely slow . Because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera , significant portions of it are out of focus . < br /><br />The film has very little dialog and what there is does n't tell you much . There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation . The way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow . Even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about , I still had a difficult time understanding what was going on . < br /><br />I knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous Ziyi Zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed . She never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she does n't have anything to smile about . I could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find .
0 The main complaint with this film is the fact that I CAN NOT tell who is who . No racism intended , but these Asians look all the same ! I can tell somewhat of the story , but heck that s about as far as it goes . The peoples identities are not a mystery , if they were a mystery I would care about them . Instead I was n't them off the screen ASAP.<br /><br />Tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie . Heck is it boring , not only do I not know these people , but they are just sitting there.<br /><br />The production is typical Chinese John Woo , terrible video with blotched scenes . This looks only slightly better than Andy Lau 's " Fulltime Killer " ( Which was a great movie . ) You would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s Hollywood . I did n't know the Chinese had these art - house beatniks .
0 Ye Lou 's film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization ( Purple Butterfly ) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai . Ding Hui ( Zhang Ziyi ) and her ex - lover Hidehiko Itami ( Toru Nakamura ) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer from Paris . The film substitutes a convoluted , semi - historical conflict for a plot , without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes . The sudden time shifting does n't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless . Normally I do n't mind dark movies , but the absence of light , the bone - jarringly shaky camera footage , and the generally bad film - making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in . I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film " has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography " , but I do n't think that helps the movie . The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century , and I do n't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film . The overly melodramatic moments do n't add to its watchability.<br /><br />The actors are all suitably melancholy . Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films , brooding and looking generally annoyed . However , at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love - making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.<br /><br />All in all , a very disappointing film , especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He . 2/10
0 I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever . Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you 've seen contained no dialogue , long drawn - out far - away stares and silences , and hack editing , then you 're spot on.<br /><br />Complicated story - line ? Hardly . Try juvenile and amateurish . Exquisite moods and haunting memories ? Hardly . Try flat - out boring and trite.<br /><br />This was awful . I could not wait for it to be over . Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of " How are you ? I 'm fine . Are you sure ? Yes . " Wow ! What depth of character . I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.<br /><br />As a huge fan of many Chinese , Japanese and Korean films , I was totally disappointed in this . Even Zhang 's sentimentally sappy " The Road Home " was better than this .
0 Rex Reed once said of a movie ( " Julia and Julia " to be specific ) that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice . I was reminded of that as I snored through Purple Butterfly . This one appeared to be shot through gauze.<br /><br />The story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors ' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time . < br /><br />Also , everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters . I call this the " Dead Poets Society " syndrome.<br /><br />There was nobody to care about , nobody to become interested in dramatically , and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances.<br /><br />A total disappointment .
0 Did anybody succeed in getting in this movie?<br /><br />It 's a total mess to me : a vague historical / sentimental context instead of a plot , a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours!<br /><br />Shame on those who wasted money here .
0 Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town , she 's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week . Since Melissa is beautiful , every boy in town wants to hook up with her , but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die.<br /><br />To be honest the real reason I wanted to watch this film is because Dana Kimmel of Friday The 13th pt 3 was in it which is n't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie . When I started watching it I realized that " Sweet Sixteen " is n't a very good slasher , it 's really dull and boring and just does n't go anywhere . After over an hour , only three murders have occurred and the story has n't really developed in any possible way.<br /><br />The movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s , the movie suffers from being too dark at times . The acting is actually pretty good though and Melissa 's character is easy to sympathize with , even though she 's a complete slut.<br /><br />The story line is n't completely rubbish but it 's just way too dull to keep you interested , the only things that kept me interested was Melissa she was stunning and Dana Kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie.<br /><br />All in all pretty dull slasher flick that does n't go anywhere I 'd definitely would n't recommend it to Slasher fans .
0 SWEET SIXTEEN ( 1983 ) * * / * * * * * 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins , Susan Strasberg , Aleisa Shirley , Patrick Macnee , Dana Kimmell < br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it is n't long before folks around her start dying off . The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell . The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk . These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa 's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher is n't too memorable . It has a made for TV feel , without much score besides the title character 's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout . Lines like " the killer will turn us into coleslaw . " Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays . Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship . Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make - up . This movie would be hard - pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close - ups of her . The social commentary on Indians was n't developed enough to be taken seriously . I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets . Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt 's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver . But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow .
0 Melissa 's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she 's just discovering her sexuality with boys . But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic ' 80 's slasher film . It 's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke ( Bo Hopkins , The Wild Bunch ) and his annoying mystery - loving goody two - shoes daughter , Marci ( Dana Kimmell , Friday the 13th part 3 ) , to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it 's ' 80 's Slasher brethren . It does n't hurt that Alesia has a great body ( I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i 'm not overly perverted ) . On the downside , the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary , a grating theme some that is used a bit too often , and an ending that is a tad anti - climatic . But the good outweigh the bad ( barely ) . Give this a rent , but I would n't buy it.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Aleisa Shirley shows her tits , bush and ass < br /><br />My Grade : C < br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras : An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder , Scott Spiegel ; Both Director 's cut & theatrical version of the film ; Audio conversation with star Shirley and Director Jim Sotos ; interview with Shirley , Sotos & Bo Hopkins ; still gallery ; theatrical trailer for this film ; and trailers for Nightmare , Stunt Rock , Rituals , & Balalaika Conspiracy
0 I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film , and of the few reviews that there are to be positive . I saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed . I did n't find it very enjoyable at all . It was slow , and lacks the entertainment value . Even the murder scenes are lackluster , with real close - up shots of generic stabbings that do n't look good at all . And the supposed great twist ending is really not much , I did see it coming , and then the ending just seemed cliche . This movie may not get much mention , but by the little that it does get , it is overrated . I would not recommend this movie .
0 Murders are occurring in a Texas desert town . Who is responsible ? Slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions ( the latter really does n't fit ) , but otherwise strictly for slasher fans , who will appreciate the gore and nudity , which are two conventional elements for these films.<br /><br />Dana Kimmell ( of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 infamy ) stars as the bratty quasi - detective teen.<br /><br />*1/2 out of * * * * < br /><br />MPAA : Rated R for violence and gore , nudity , and some language .
0 This movie was in a sci - fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for Christmas . It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie , and like that movie , has scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason . One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there 's a Cold War tension portrayed between America and Russia . Like in Godzilla , Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world , paying close attention to Tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites it . All in all , this is an okay movie . Some of the scenes involving Gamera , particularly the scenes in Toly , are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time . If you like Japanese giant monster movies , you 'll really get a kick out of this one . I give it a 4 out of 10 . Had this been the unedited Japanese version that I watched , it probably would 've gotten a 5 .
0 The original 1965 Japanese film " Gamera " http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker , less kid - oriented Gojira ( Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities . Gamera , of course , is a giant , flying , flame - throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla , but generally similar in most ways . < br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank . And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ( " Godzilla King of the Monsters " ) , " Gammera the Invincible " gets more than just the spelling wrong . The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira , but do n't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them . < br /><br />The film starts off promising , there are a few scenes worth of character development , and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot . Once Gamera appears , however , the film begins to descend into a fairly run - of - the mill kaiju film.<br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add - ons are OK . The directing is pretty good for this period and genre , and the special effects are not bad at all for their time ( all miniatures ) . Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good . < br /><br />The biggest problem here , of course , is that there is little to nothing original about this film . Gamera , however , develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan .
0 What 's that there in the skies ? Is it a plane ? Is it Superman ? ? Errr , no   It 's a TURTLE ! ? ! See , that 's what becomes of the Cold War ! Nothing but bad news and other issues ! The Americans shoot down a Russian combat plane somewhere over Artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts & literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle - creature named Gammera . He / she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path . The arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super - sophisticated ice - bomb , but Gammera has another surprise in store   The damn turtle can fly ! The first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence ! Gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air . How can you not love that ? Then there 's also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who 's able to telepathically communicate with the monster , but that 's just not interesting enough . Flying turtle , people ! ! There 's very little else to write about this Japanese ( and American re - edited ) Sci - Fi effort , apart from that it 's an obvious and totally shameless rip - off of such classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms . The effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and , unlike the aforementioned films , it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance . Respectable actors like Brian Donlevy ( " The Quatermass Experiment " ) and Dick O'Neill ( " Wolfen " ) seem unaware of what film set they 're on and even the original Japanese mayhem - scenes are n't very convincing . Gammera 's very own and personalized theme - song is rather cool , though , so it gets one extra point for that .
0 " After the atomic bombs carried by a shot - down Soviet bomber explode in the Arctic , the creature ' Gammera ' is released from his hibernation . The giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to Tokyo and destroys anything in his path . The military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before Tokyo is laid to waste , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis . < br /><br />The re - produced for American audiences version of this , the first film in the " Gamera " series , adds English language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed Japanese fare . Clearly , the monster is following in the footsteps of " Godzilla " . Taking his cue from ABC 's faddish " Batman ! " TV series , musician Wes Farrell 's ludicrous theme song heightens the US version 's camp appeal.<br /><br / > * * * Gammera the Invincible ( 12/15/66 ) Sandy Howard , Noriaki Yuasa ~ Dick O'Neill , Brian Donlevy , Albert Dekker , John Baragrey
0 With the rising popularity of the now iconic Godzilla series , like with any hit cinema event , there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard . With Godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju ( giant monster ) genre . Many sought after success ; a few gained it . One of the few that not only profited , but garnered popularity was Gamera , a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion . But unlike Godzilla , Gamera was marketed as a friend to all children , later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril , and thus Gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies . Unfortunately , that 's about the only audience mainstream that the original Gamera series will have any appeal to . While the new Gamera movies directed by Shusuke Kaneko are marvelous , revolutionary monster movies , the original series , including the original , is nothing special.<br /><br />The first Gamera movie , titled in Japan as " The Giant Monster Gamera " was clearly a Godzilla want - to - be . Even though the movie was produced in the era of color films , it was shot in black - and - white . Why ? To imitate the first Godzilla movie from the 1950s . Gamera also attacks Tokyo . Because Godzilla attacked Tokyo in the first movie . I do n't know much about the Japanese version , for the version I am familiar with the Americanized version , where scenes were cut and new footage with American actors were inserted ( is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first Godzilla film ? ) Now whether this adds or takes away from the film , I can not say . But " Gammera the Invincible " is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself.<br /><br />"Gammera the Invincible " is a very routine - orientated movie . The characters are from a stock of science - fiction standards , the story is inane , the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization , the acting is laughable , and so on and so forth . The only thing that differentiates it from the Godzilla series is the ending of the movie , but that 's also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts Gamera 's rampage is completely phony and ridiculous . Now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description , but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie.<br /><br />And although Shusuke Kaneko would later transform Gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s , in the original series , Gamera was not an attractive screen presence . He was neither scary nor sympathetic . He just waddles around like a toddler , swaying with each step , and knocks miniature sets over . As usual , everybody wants to destroy Gamera except for a little kid ( Yoshio Uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a ' central ' role ) who thinks Gamera is a nice turtle.<br /><br />Most movies in the genre that " Gammera the Invincible " is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure . Even in the company of many other Godzilla - imitators , this Gamera film is not a particularly good entry . And as far as my cinema experience goes , the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse . Like Godzilla , Gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters . And like Godzilla , he 'd get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again.<br /><br />It 's peculiar . Usually I recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes . But in the case of Gamera , my verdict is just the opposite . I strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s Gamera trilogy directed by Shusuke Kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested . The new films are inventive , well - made , exciting , and above all , fun . The original series is a long stream of boredom .
0 We now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine . It 's the world of Godzilla , Rodan , Mothra Ghidrah and their kind - a strange world , and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called Gamera.<br /><br />Forever in the shadow of the monolithic Toho Studios , second rung Daiei Studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies . In the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to Toho 's mammothly successful Godzilla . They wisely chose Gamera as their flagship - a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggle - teeth , and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shell 's feet - holes ( and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire!).<br /><br />The first Gamera film " Gamera The Invincible " ( as it was sold to the US ) is a virtual mirror of the first Godzilla film , only 10 years behind . American fighters chase an unmarked plane over the Arctic to its fiery demise - the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant Gamera from its icy slumber . Feeding off atomic energy , it immediately goes on a rampage , and the world wants to destroy Gamera once and for all , but a little Japanese boy named Kenny , who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside , believes Gamera is essentially kind and benevolent . He 's like a little Jewish kid with a pinup of Hitler . " Gamera is a GOOD turtle , " he pleads , then sulks , and puts on a face like someone 's pooped in his coco pops . Miraculously the world 's leaders listen to him , and so begins Z - Plan to save the world AND Gamera from complete destruction.<br /><br />Released in 1965 , Gamera was a surprising hit . The annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both Japan and the US , and the sight of Gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of Tokyo and the North Pole is gloriously chintzy . Most surprising of all is the longevity of the series : eight original Gamera films , plus a slew of recent remakes . Not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast - and if I hear " Gamera is friends to ALL children " one more time I'M going to crush Tokyo . Which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a Seiko billboard in the 1965 turtle - fest Gamera .
0 Flame in , flame out . That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell , a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon . I 'm not a fan of Japanese monster films , but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci - fi collection put out by Mill Creek / Treeline Films . It 's a great value at about twenty five bucks , so at fifty cents per movie , it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.<br /><br />Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast , and he 's not happy . Like Godzilla , he takes it out on Tokyo , setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet . They arrive at ' Plan Z ' , the hope of the world , and would n't you know it , there 's a scene where a huge shed is shown that 's called the ' Z Plan ' building ; that was a nice touch.<br /><br />By the mid 1960 's , this country still was n't quite politically correct . One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee . I guess there were n't any privates around.<br /><br />Good old Gammera was quite the sight though , walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged . That 's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship , whisking him off to Mars to save the world . High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save , now let 's get back to the Cold War.<br /><br />Like Godzilla , Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films , but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying , flaming turtles . Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has " Attack of the Monsters " with a featured guest appearance by the Big G. It took all I had to make it through to the end of both films ; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said ' Gammera , Sayonara ! "
0 This " clever " film was originally a Japanese film . And while I assume that original film was pretty bad , it was made a good bit worse when American - International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American - made segments to fool the audience . Now unless your audience is made of total idiots , it becomes painfully obvious that this was done -- and done with little finesse or care about the final product . The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different . Plus , the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera -- the evil flying turtle ! And although this is a fire - breathing , flying and destructive monster , there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film -- in particular , film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker . They both just looked tired and ill - at - ease for being there.<br /><br />Now as for the monster , it 's not quite the standard Godzilla - like creature . Seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious . On the other hand , the crappy model planes , destructible balsa buildings and power plant are , as usual , in this film and come as no surprise . Plus an odd Japanese monster movie cliché is included that will frankly annoy most non - Japanese audience members , and that is the " adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him " . Yeah , right . Well , just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films , you 've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster , though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla , Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot ! Silly , exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year - old , bad acting , meaningless American clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film . Oddly , while most will surely hate this film ( and that stupid kid ) , there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to Bergman and Kurosawa . Do n't believe them -- this IS a terrible film!<br /><br />FYI -- Apparently due to his terrific stage presence , Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations . None of these change the central fact that he is a fire - breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really , really lame .
0 There 's not much to say about this one . Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle . He is loosed by a nuclear explosion . He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk ( oh yeah , power lines . I almost forgot ) . At one time , early in the film , he befriends a little boy , and instead of just throwing him away , or squashing him , he places him down on the ground . Safe . From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away , show up and run away , show up and run away . For some reason , Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away . Oh , well , the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space . As usual , the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated ( a guy in a Gammera suit ) . The Japanese army ( with the help of Americans ) , uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt , and , of course , it does no good . They should know this anyway . We 've seen a lot of monsters stomp on Tokyo . Not to put these down because they can be fun , but it 's really not very good .
0 Nobody , but nobody , could chew the scenery like the Divine One , Ruth Elizabeth Davis , and " Elizabeth and Essex " is a great example why . Although she overplays the part at times , watch her when she gawfs about Raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies - in - waiting are about to play : in that one moment , she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely ! At other times , she is done in by the script 's sappiness . When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable , she comes off as weak and shrewish . This has the added effect of undermining her authority : when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice , it 's hard to take her seriously.<br /><br />Flynn exudes charm , making us see how Essex was able to worm his way into Elizabeth 's heart , but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man . It also does n't help that Essex is badly underwritten . Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his Queen - even as he swears fidelity to her - except only that he is more blue - blooded , thus , more " worthy " of rule ? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex 's letters ? He 's in no risk of falling out of favor , and we know where Essex ( and his head ) is headed . So why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable?<br /><br />What did Curtiz do with all the $ $ $ he was given ? He does n't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage . He should 've ended it with Elizabeth the first time alone at The Tower ; everything else that follows ( especially the final scene between her and Essex ) is unnecessary . The costumes are fantastic . And is it me , or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon ?
0 Oh dear , this movie was bad for various reasons . I was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over - all score . Sorry , but to rate this highly as many have , is a joke ! Once you get past the one shot / black and white movie gimmick , which was a nice idea , the movie drags on , even at a run time of only 66 minutes . The credits sequence at the start was so annoying too!In the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel , wow , that was needed in the story ! How slow were the guys chasing and actually managing to wound Campbell ? ? They did not seem to bother continue chasing him ... sigh .. I am only too glad I got this free with a special Edition of Evil Dead ! !
0 This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long time . The story was boring , the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy . I 'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project , but it certainly played like one . It is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take . The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts .
0 This is the most messed up entry on IMDb that I 've yet to stumble across . All the previous reviewers act like this is the movie . This is NOT the movie . Rather it 's merely a featurette that 's an extra on the DVD of the movie " The One " It also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it 's listed here as . In actuality it 's barely over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts . and his reflections on the movie . So yeah this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar . Do n't listen to any of the other reviews as they are ALL wrong . You can trust me , because I never feed you , dear reader , BS.<br /><br />and that 's the truth . i guess u can say that i 'm " the One " Reviewer that matters .
0 This film was a waste of time , even rented on DVD . If super - speedy camera shots get any faster than this , we might as well pay twenty bucks to get in the laundromat , get popcorn , and watch the dryer spin . Jet Li is so much better than this . One can only hope that he wo n't be making deals anytime soon to make another cliche - ridden film like The One.<br /><br />If there 's one film you should avoid , this is " The One " .
0 I rented this film just to see Amber Benson , though after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ..... however the first problem was that there really was n't a story ... or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense . The second problem was there was no set up for these characters ... yes I got that they all went to school together , but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and did n't like each other ... so why did they keep getting together . Flaw number 3 ... the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense ( especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in) ... he was sadly mistaken . It was painful to watch a terrific actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring this back to life .... my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film .
0 Just finished this movie ... saw it on the video shelf and being a Nick Stahl fan I just had to rent it . In all honesty , it probably should have stayed on the shelf . The concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they came along . And the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion ... if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you 'll see what I mean!<br /><br />On a positive note , Nick Stahl 's acting was great ( especially considering what he had to work with ) . Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character ... too much Paul Finch from " American Pie " coming through for my liking.<br /><br />And finally , the worst part of this movie has to be January Jones ' emotionless performance ... I guess a pretty face really is all that matters in Hollywood .
0 The name of Nick Stahl , the young cast and the attractive cover of the VHS made me buy and watch this flick , expecting to see a good teen slash movie . What a crap ! The full of clichés screenplay , the dialogs and the performances are awful , dreadful , very bad , terrible , horrendous  summarizing , a complete waste of time . There is no horror , black humor , only an absolutely boring story , with shameful plot points . The film begins with six characters , indeed three couples , together like a group of friends , but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies , playing a ridiculous senseless game called " Taboo " , and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues . That is it : no previous development of the characters , the viewer does not know who they are , their motives and relationship . Then , there is an ellipsis to one year later , and the same group is gathered together in a New Years Eve party , insulting each other in a very sordid way . But the plot and the twists are so ridiculous , predictable , mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review . One advice only : do not waste your time or money on this garbage , you will certainly regret . My vote is one ( awful).<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Taboo  Jogando Com o Assassino " ( " Taboo  Playing With the Killer " )
0 As a movie critic for several Dutch websites , I have to see lot 's of movies , and not all very good ones . Some movies are so bad , you wo n't be surprised that they are released straight on video . With taboo , Iám surprised that it is released on video at all . This is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish . < br /><br />A group of youngsters plays a game of taboo . They write down their most sickening wish or act , and later on people are murdered for their taboo 's . The question is , should we believe what we see?<br /><br />The movie has a potential interesting plot - twist , and I wo n't give it away here . But what could have been interesting stays stupid , bad acted and without any reason.<br /><br />Some of the actors have played in bigger titles before , so why on earth did they sign up for this ? If you see this anywhere , try to dodge it . There is no logic , no human sense of quality in this movie .
0 The movie has the longest , most tortured and agonized ending of any movie I 've seen in a long time . Unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits . January Jones gives such a wooden performance , I was surprised she did n't go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film . I do n't really remember her from the other films she 's done ( a blessing I have to believe . I never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case , it is so bad that it actually stands out from the ATROCIOUS script . Granted she 's given lines and situations Meryl Streep would have trouble with but I swear at times she s reading from a cue card off set . At other times I thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way . For REAL ! The plot , dialog and pacing are as bad as you 'll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated . I feel sorry for the other actors . Cruel intentions/ 10 little indians / breakfast club shoved into a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a grade school writer- director . Take that back this has Studio exec crayola all over it .
0 I wo n't argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable , as is January Jones 's performance , but please check her out , if you have n't already , in the AMC TV series ' Mad Men , " starting later this month . She 's excellent , as is the entire cast . I 'll charitably assume she took on the " Taboo " role strictly for the money , and , realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be , turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation . Do n't know if that 's the case , but I ( now ) know for sure that she can act.<br /><br />At first , watching " Taboo , " I was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot . No such luck . Hard to believe the director did n't suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw.<br /><br />Ironically , her winning performance in " Mad Men " comes as a character who , at least in her early appearances , is very repressed , reserved , unsure of herself , and rather colorless , not unlike her " Taboo " role . But as the TV series progressed , she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early-60 's whitebread Mom role . Ca n't wait to see where they take her character in the 2nd season.<br /><br />To sum up , avoid " Taboo " like leprosy , but definitely check out " Mad Men . "
0 I watched this movie on the grounds that Amber Benson rocks and Nick Stahl is generally pretty cool - I figured that any film featuring two actors I like and respect could n't be all bad . And in that sense , I was right - considering the cringe - making dialogue they were given , both of them perform reasonably well . Not well enough to stop the movie from sucking , you understand , but well enough that I was able to make it through the 75-odd minutes of movie ( and that 's the main sign of an awful film : when , at 40 minutes through , you 're already praying for it to be over).<br /><br />It 's hard to know where to start with the problems in " Taboo " . The dialogue , as mentioned , is appalling ; wooden and completely unnatural . January Jones ' acting is unbelievably bad , and since she 's the character we spend most of our time following around the house , this is an unforgivable flaw . The plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clichéd as to be completely predictable ( literally , not one of the major ' twists ' in this film would surprise anyone but a toddler ) . A few interesting shots aside , the director tries far too hard with far too little success , awkward tracking shots and jittery camera - work distracting from what little element of story there is.<br /><br />Three of this movie 's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson , and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit . I would n't recommend this movie to anyone , ever , under any circumstances . Avoid at all costs .
0 ... And I never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1 ! But this one is honestly the worst movie I 've ever watched . My wife picked it up because of the cast , but the storyline right since the DVD box seemed quite predictable . It is not a mystery , nor a juvenile - catching film . It does not include any sensuality , if that 's what the title could remotely have suggest any of you . This is just a total no - no . Do n't waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as - grown - up kind of Gothic setting , where a killer is going after them . Nothing new , nothing interesting , nothing worth watching . Max Makowski makes the worst of Nick Stahl .
0 Do n't waste your time or money on this one . The half decent cast might fool you into thinking that this teen - thriller , whilst hardly about to break any records , might lightly entertain for 80 minutes.<br /><br />It won't.<br /><br />It wo n't make you scared , laugh , cry or even challenge your intellect . It will leave you wondering how on earth this movie ever finished production . Yes , it really is that poor .
0 This was quite possibly the worst film I 've ever seen . The plot did n't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful . I 'm a big fan of Amber Benson , I think she 's usually a wonderful actress , I ca n't imagine why she decided to do this film . Her character , Piper , is drunk for almost the whole film , with the exception of the opening scene . On the plus side , there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad , I actually laughed out loud . But despite that , I would not recommend this film to anyone . It 's only 80 minutes long , but that 's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted .
0 There is no reason to see this movie . A good plot idea is handled very badly . In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense . The reason for the killings are not made clear . The acting is awful . Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director . He was excellent in In the Bedroom , but here he is terrible . Amber Benson from Buffy , has to change her character someday . Even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed . Even though the movie was 80 minutes , which is too short for a good movie ( but too long for this one),there are no deleted scenes in the DVD which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters.<br /><br />Don't spend the time on this one .

0 Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing , but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an * audience * like or empathize with any of the characters either . There are movies so bad they are good ( a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films ) , and there 's just plain bad ( like 99 % of Uwe Boll 's " work " ) . This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer ( e.g. , Mystery Science Theatre 3000 ) . Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard ( it 's how my mind works All The Time ) , for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing , eventually into * this * film you 'll just want to pull your own head off , painfully aware the movie " Taboo " robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you 'll never get back . Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced , boring waste of time . The most puzzling aspect of this film is that * someone * green - lit and/or funded it ... I rented " Taboo " solely for the normally talented Amber Benson , who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film . I 've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue , the reviews to which I 'd better read first . Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location .
0 A cheesy , compellingly awful ( and NOT in a fun way ) C Grade movie . Everything shouts ' amateur ' , from the crumby script ( bizarre premises , limited coherence and predictable endings ; the turgid lighting , sound and hand - held wobbly camera angles ; the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references ; the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the Z rate acting . I saw it on DVD and kept hoping Edward Wood would pop out . All is forgiven - your Worst Films are works of art , and more coherent than this twaddle.<br /><br />But still , preferable to the warbling ' Every night in my dreams I hear you ' - are you sure the Titanic crew were n't involved in this on the side ?
0 Wow it 's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile I think that someone else JUST reviewed it a couple days ago.<br /><br />Anyways , I watched this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl , for the record.<br /><br />The movie was ridiculous . The characters drove me INSANE , they were SO Cliché and STEREOTYPED . This movie had some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard . It had way too many plot twists too.<br /><br />There is ONE scene in the movie worth seeing however , the scene : " Warm heart , cold gun " where Nick Stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower . ( Well , actually they were all obnoxious . ) But his acting in that scene was excellent . The look on his face , it reminded my of American Psycho ( a good movie ) . The scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for , do yourself a favor and do n't watch it .
0 I 'm embarrassed to be writing this review . I say that because those of you reading it will know that I sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers . But I just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on IMDb before they watch a film not to watch this one . It 's the least I can do . This is a bad movie ! Trust me . The plot is goofy . The acting is amateurish . And the directing , camera work , sets , costumes , etc . are all second rate . Let it go .
0 How did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast ? Ridiculous , predictable and thoroughly unbelievable , this is well - acted and slickly directed , but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the all - time worst thrillers I 've seen in years . Amazingly bad , and not in a fun way . Avoid at all costs , even if you 're a fan of someone in the cast .
0 I do n't know why I 'm commenting this stupid reality - show I happened to watch a few episodes of(a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something , I did n't watch the entire thing though . Only like three episodes)as I was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day . Maybe I 'm just bored today:-)<br /><br />I feel sorry for Britney , I really do . For all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity . Or she 's self - centered to the extreme . She married the nitwit Federline(okay anybody can make a mistake ) and before that she " starred " this horrible show about her everyday life with him , where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it , no matter if it is in someone 's face or into the shower as Federline is standing in there . She 's babbling about her sex - life without leaving anything to your imagination , I do n't care for my part , but I ca n't help wondering how she feels about it now when she 's divorced . And yes , for her sake I 'm embarrassed . But I should n't be . She seem to live a pretty empty , shallow life though . I do n't want to swap lives with her even if I could . Road - kill TV if you like .
0 This is probably the worst excuse for television programming since , oh , I do n't know , WHATS HAPPENING NOW ? NOTHING ever happened on this ridiculous " series " . Even though it 's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin themselves , you do n't get any good details into their personal lives . It 's mostly just them making stupid , jokey small talk and acting like white trash . Look , I love Britney 's music as much as the next babe , but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to Britney that they would watch her clip her toenails ( yes , that could be an actual episode ) . Thank God these two broke up , because they were PAINFULLY dull together . This show is TOXIC !
0 i 'm ask ... what a f * * * are whit the real - TV never i see some b * * * * * * * in my life is : a * * * * * * , dirty , f * * * * * * bad and other a * * * * * * * things but anything more is just a piece of American s * * * all time Britney saying ' ' oh s * * * , i wanna see his cock , i wanna f * * * , and stuck his d * * * '' and he thinking ' ' oh like i gone to still her money '' it 's just another show of s * * * any one more the only good are what Britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it 's just like i say another s * * * show in this s * * * sill out the money pure sex all f * * * * * * * time , i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f * * * * * * money
0 this one of the best celebrity 's reality shows a ever saw . we can see the concerts we can see the life of Britney , i love the five episodes . i was always being surprised by Britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people do n't watch the show at all we can how a great person she his . she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work . i just do n't give a 10 because of k - fed he his a real jerk he does n't seem to like Britney at all . I they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how Britney really is . Go Britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts .
0 ... but it 's certainly not without merit . Already writer - director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories , creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations , and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue . ( No wonder the Coen brothers ' next movie is going to be an homage to Sturges.)<br /><br />The major problem is that the plot 's not all the way there yet ; it lacks surprise , the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing . The coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon , and the ending is thoroughly predictable . Frank Capra does this sort of thing much better.<br /><br />If you 're new to Preston Sturges , check out " The Lady Eve " or " Sullivan 's Travels " or " The Miracle of Morgan 's Creek " first . If you 've seen these already , then go ahead and watch this one .
0 I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but , wow , did it turn corny , or should I say , " just plain stupid . " This is just another example of outdated humor . It might have been funny in 1940 , but not now .... not even close.<br /><br />Dick Powell is always interesting to watch . I especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the Busby Berkeley musicals to where he 's mature and sounds it , too.<br /><br />He was fine as " Jimmy MacDonald , " but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters , the worst being the boss ( Raymond Walburn ) of the Maxford House Coffee Company , who did nothing but shout all the time . He was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie .
0 I found it a real task to sit through this film . The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said . There was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie . These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together . It is rare that I rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking " so what " and " why did I waste my time watching this . "
0 Good movies are original , some leave a message or touch you in a certain way , but sometimes you 're not in the mood for that . < br /><br />I wanted something simple , no thinking just plain action when I watched this one . It started of good and was quite entertaining , so why a bad review . Well in the end the movie lost it 's credibility . The storyline was n't that cheesy at all , the action was not too special but overall good , acting was OK , so more than enough to satisfy my needs . But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top , and it left me with a bad feeling . They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the " no thinking just plain action " category . So in conclusion if you know you 'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical : do n't watch ! otherwise I 'd say go ahead ...
0 Went to watch this movie expecting a ' nothing really much ' action flick , still got very disappointed . The opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy . It keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in . Well , nothing of that sort happens . The movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed . Wonder what was the director thinking . Made no sense watsoever . The movie lacked in all aspects , had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow , even if " Rambo " was in it , I do n't think he could have helped the rating at all . There is simply no logic to the movie . A perfect way to waste your time and money . By far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who 'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it . Definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them .
0 This movie is just another average action flick , but it could have been so much better . When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help . Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special . Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie . Then came the final scene , the show - down , the one we had been waiting for , but was like watching something from the A - Team in the 80s . They shoot wildly , nothing hits , and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old , same old .
0 This film came recommended as a good action film , which I do n't really think it is . I found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow . There really is n't that much action until the end of the film and it 's pretty dark and hard to see what 's really happening . I was sure hoping for something different , but , alas , did n't find it here .
0 Wow , the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago . I 'll preface by saying I 'm not a fan of narrated episodes . If the story / actors / etc . are worth their salt , they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out , reminded me of personages who ca n't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters . The psychobabble was tedious and boring , but some enjoy that kind of thing , it 's just not my cup O tea . They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something . Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house , which has a singular half circle driveway , yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under , because it 's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property . Sloppy editing , as she pulls into the driveway ( for what seems the 100th time ) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house ? The dolly close - ups were also overdone , like some Jr. High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time . I could keep picking apart , but that might get almost as boring as this episode was . It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible . I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player , automatic top etc . The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends , abruptly . No loose ends tied up , nothing explained or terminated . Not that many would notice , I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end .
0 I am a current A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this movie in class , and what I got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film . The film is obviously leaning towards to P.O.V. of the " common deaf perception " their is no middle ground . Also , the film did n't make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic . I.E. Deaf People who were born hearing and later went deaf . Is it right or wrong in that instance ? The film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the Deaf w/ a capital " D " . Not that this is bad , but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly unbiased .
0 If you are having a bad day , or bad week . If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles . I do n't think Role Models is that movie for you.<br /><br />The film centers around Danny(Paul Rudd ) and Wheeler(Seann William Scott ) Two juice promoters , who go to schools promoting the product , telling kids to stay off drugs , and more juice . But Danny is having the worst week ever , and crashes his company car , with Wheeler in the seat next to him . His soon to be ex girlfriend Beth(Elizabeth Banks ) who is a lawyer , manages to avoid getting them jail time , by doing hours of community service , volunteering at a big brother place called Sturdy Wings led by Gayle(Jane Lynch ) . Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie(Bobb'e J Thompson ) who is 10 years old , and has a foul mouth like he 's Chris Rock . Danny is assigned to Augie(McLovins , Christopher Mintz - Plasse ) who likes to dress like a knight , and fight like he is in medieval times . But will this be good for Danny and Wheeler , or will they be better off in jail?<br /><br />Okay I 'm not gon na beat around the bush , this movie was very unpleasant in many ways . Namely the Ronnie character , hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young , was very shocking . If he was a little bit older , it would not have mater'd as much . I mean what where his parents thinking , when they sign'd him on to this . Elizabeth Banks character is so unwatchable , maybe I was supposed to feel bad for her character , but I felt nothing , because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies . And Jane Lynch , who 's the worst of the worst . She delivers the most overacting performance ever . Playing a former drug addict , who acts like she still is on drugs . Listening to her give all that annoying dialog , made me want to throw my head up against the wall . Seann William Scott once again playing another Stifler like character , he should really try to separate himself , and this film wo n't do it . And the more Scott tries to hard to be funny , is what keeps him from being funny.<br /><br />Now Paul Rudd on the other hand , I 'm gon na separate from the others in the film , cause he manages to deliver a solid performance , although he does not get higher laughs , but he is the most interesting character from the rest . Cause Rudd does not overact , and does not try so hard . The scenes with him and Mintz - Plasse are watchable . But the rest of the film is so stupid , it picks up at times . But it becomes so predictable and uninteresting . It is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new , there all the same , they take no chances . Role Models is an example of that .
0 Make up your own mind . Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder . No offense Mr. Wonder . Maybe it is comedy , but I just found it stupid . Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids ; Wheeler(Seann William Scott)and Danny(Paul Rudd),two energy drink salesmen , to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch ) . One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobb'e J. Thompson ) , a foul - mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz - Plasse ) , a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world . Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life , love and heavy metal . Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies . Supporting are : Elizabeth Banks , Ken Jeongg , Kerri Kenney - Silver , Amanda Righetti and David Wain .
0 well , i hated knocked up , i despised 40-year - old virgin , and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie . do yourself a favor , and skip it . i admit , i do n't like the actors in this movie , and after my 18-year - old son showed me the cover of the DVD , i was like , " i would n't like that movie , " but at his insistence , i decided to give it a try , unfortunately . < br /><br />about two minutes into the movie i turned it off , i was so offended . it 's just disgusting . any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie . call me old fashioned , but shoving your pussy juice - covered hand into your friend 's face so he will know you " got some " is over the line of decency , in my opinion . yeah , that 's how this putrid little film starts , and i can only imagine it gets much worse from there . another real winner for Mr. Rudd . i bet he 's proud as punch . imagine if you could only get worthless roles like he gets , would you stay in movies ? despite the pay , i would n't . < br /><br />i should have known better ; next time i will .
0 Tell the truth I ’m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people , which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie . And after having seen it , I was really a disappointed , and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie.<br /><br />I’m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid ’s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing . I ’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.<br /><br />Synopsis : The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior . There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all . They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done . The story is very predictable ( though expected ) and the humor is lame . And have n’t we already seen the same characters ( play by Mc Lovin’ ) in so many other movies ( like Sasquatch Gang ? ) . I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay . And the acting is so - so as expected when you ’re watching this type of movie . And the direction , what do one expect ? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer , and that movie also sucks . But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time . Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie . Ca n’t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Pros : Elizabeth Bank ? Two topless scenes.<br /><br />Cons : Not funny , dreadful story , nudity and kids do not mix together.<br /><br />Rating : 3.5/10 ( Grade : F )
0 As soon as it hits a screen , it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! But on behalf of its producers I must say it does n't fall into any known movie category , it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! It 's a " Neurological drama " ! It saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person 's brain.<br /><br />It 's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one . It drives you speechless , all you members go numb , your mouth falls open and remains so , and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf.<br /><br />No small feat for such a sort of a " movie".<br /><br />The only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is OUTRAGE ! ! ! ! ! !
0 I watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that I read about it here by others.<br /><br />They definitely saw something in this movie I did n't see , that 's for sure.<br /><br />The movie starts off at a good pace , and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting , then it begins to get logged down and draggy , not to mention completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Eventually you find yourself saying : " What ? ! ? He 's going to do that too ? Just how far is he going to go with this thing?" < br /><br />The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum 's character , John , going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine . There is a robbery and a new store clerk , Auggie Rose , gets killed during the robbery . < br /><br />John gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy . This seems a little much , but wait , there 's more.<br /><br />John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose . < br /><br />For reasons that never make any kind of logical sense , John , who has a very good life , a beautiful , loving girlfriend , a secure , well - paying job , nice house , nice car , expensive suits -- decides he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose was , and experience life in a low paying job , living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people.<br /><br />Why this dim - witted , half - baked film got favorable reviews I 'll never know . Sure Goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a BIG infatuation with Jeff Goldblum and have to see every film he 's in , I would n't recommend this turkey . It 's approximately two hours of your life you 're not going to get back - and believe me - you 'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over , other than being grateful you 're not still sitting there watching this film!<br /><br / >
0 I do n't understand the positive comments made about this film . It is cheap and nasty on all levels and I can not understand how it ever got made.<br /><br />Cartoon characters abound - Sue 's foul - mouthed , alcoholic , layabout , Irish father being a prime example . None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except , briefly , for Sue 's Asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence ! As desperately unattractive as they both are , I 've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do , why should I be expected to care what happens to them ? So many reviews keep carping on about how " realistic " it is . If that is true , it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film.<br /><br />I did n't like the film at all .
0 One of , if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s . < br /><br />This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who ' seduces ' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux - posh wife has nothing to redeem it.<br /><br />In turns gratuitous , puerile , uncouth and unrealistic , this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny , provocative , intellectual and controversial . < br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan , Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script . It 's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar 's only work to make it onto the screen . Complete and utter rubbish on every level .
0 my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world ( or at least those who will read this ) that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one . i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid . you could say i suffered watching it ... my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and were n't able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off . i do not recommend this to anyone . at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case . it is not a comedy , it is not drama , it is not action , it is not horror , it is just horrible !
0 I can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film 's link with the Eighties but I really would n't say it 's an accurate depiction of most peoples ' lives in that era - even on the poorest Bradford estates . It is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old Royal Court Theatre was churning out at that time . Plenty of ' right - on ' artistry for small , small audiences but enough well - connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights . IThe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you 'll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in ' Gregory 's Girl ' . < br /><br />I would be tempted to call this a ' kitchen sink ' drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry . However , as far as having a decent script is concerned , this film is indeed all washed up . For some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst Guardian reading film - goers - I can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it . Steer clear my friends . It is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates . it isn't .. but it is grim . Do the washing up instead .
0 This is a strange sex comedy because there`s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex , most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES . I kid you not , the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you , especially if you`re watching with your grandparents .<br /><br />As for the rest of RITA , SUE AND BOB TOO there`s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the F word . This a rather bleak hyper - realist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
0 Pretty awful but watchable and entertaining . It 's the same old story ( if you 've lived through the 80s ) . Vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the States . A - Team meets Death Wish , my favorite!<br /><br />Time goes on , the soldiers go home , and years later a friend is in trouble . No , wait -- in fact , the friend is dead and it is his dad that 's in trouble . Our first hero , Joey , is killed by an exceedingly horrifying ( super pointy ) meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father 's small store from the local " protection " gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war . Desperate for help , the father talks to Sarge , the leader of Joey 's old unit from Vietnam , when Sarge shows up for the funeral.<br /><br />Well , the squeaky wheel gets the grease , and the old gang saddles up for the city . You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The one thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning , and about how they 're really good at what they do when they plan ahead . But Joey would n't have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in Vietnam in the first place if the unit had n't been messing around ! Then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs , they do it again . For no reason at all , they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present . Phh ! ! ! ! I raise my hands in disgust . Foolishness!<br /><br />There is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it 's real . EVERY single one of them . Hmm .... <br /><br />What are you going to do ? Keep watching , I guess . The movie is n't too horrible to watch , but it IS a tease . There are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening . The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie -- the explosives in Vietnam , Joey 's death battle , and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside ( poor Teddy!).<br /><br />I guess my main beef with this movie is that I feel let down by it . Even the confusing subplots with " mystery helpers " and their bizarrely cross - purpose motives was n't enough to save it at the end . But someday maybe it 'll all come right and they 'll make a sequel . Ha ha ha ha ! ! !
0 Becky Harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously ONLY purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls ! Miss Harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene . Once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no AARP queen . If these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid , I want someone to clue me in . Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally wore out my VHS copy capturing her charms . I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD.<br /><br />The rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention . I was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent , however I was disappointed on both counts . God Bless Becky Harris !
0 One of the many vigilante epics that flooded the market by the mid-80s . The routine plot has echoes of " The Magnificent Seven " ( believe it or not ) , the action scenes are lamely handled and the special effects are non - existent . You COULD do worse .... but the film is still just a waste of time . ( * 1/2 )
0 Although Robert " Knox " Benfer has his fans , I 'm not one of them . His films are asinine and amateurish , and and just not very funny , unless you 're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor . < br /><br />He 's certainly not famous , as him immature fans would like you to believe , by harassing people at Wikipedia , or stuffing the ratings votes here at the IMDb . He 's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets , which speaks volumes about his and his creation 's " fame".<br /><br />Benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation , but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he 'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer . As of this moment , though , he 's just a kid with a camera , and it shows .
0 boring stuff we got here . His 5 minute shorts are better than this . know why ? because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is . < br /><br />The plot is kinda ... eh .. the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny =( I had my hopes up , the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny . Just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh .. not working.<br /><br />Maybe next time knox.<br /><br />Maybe re - cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good .
0 I saw this movie the other night . I ca n't even begin to express how much this movie sucked . The writing , the voice acting , even the claymation . Terrible , Terrible , Terrible . It 's like watching 24 hours of C - Span for the sake of comedy . It just does n't work . It literally falls flat at about every spot possible.<br /><br />Also , the movie 's animation is very poor quality . I know that this is an movie made by one person , but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap , maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.<br /><br />This show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time . Yikes . It really was that bad . If you 're looking for a movie that will make you laugh , steer clear from this abomination . My advice : Do n't even buy it , or look it up for that matter . Your brain will than you .
0 ........ and an extremely bad one at that ! ! ! How long did this train - wreck last ? ? 14 episodes or something ? ? I can see why now.<br /><br />I bought the " Serenity " episode from Amazon Unboxed . It was my first purchase , so was free . That is the ONLY good thing about the experience ( incident??)<br /><br />I wo n't comment really on the acting , since these were , I guess , fairly new people who had n't really gotten the job down just right yet . At least I 've never seen them before in any type of major show , theater or TV . If I did , then I have easily forgotten them.<br /><br />But the special effects were absolutely horrendous . True , this is n't exactly a multi - million $ $ project , but the original Star Trek did better than this & that was THIRTY - FIVE YEARS ago . I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys ( reapers or something like that ) ship as it chased the hilarious looking Firefly , with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket . I fully expected to eventually see the Wiley Coyote riding on top , while chasing after the Roadrunner . MODERN jet / rocket engines do n't even do it that bad.<br /><br />And that was n't even the worst of it . The wild - west type shoot - outs had me wondering if I was actually watching a sci - fi film or a Gene Autry one.<br /><br />Regardless of the hype , do n't waste your time ... I did ... all 80-something minutes of the disaster called " Firefly " .
0 This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting ( mainly from the supporting characters ) . The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself ... <br /><br />Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool . The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment.<br /><br />If you have never seen Rio , or the inside of a British bank , this film is for you . 2 out of 10 .
0 This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity . Most of them have their elements of silliness , the postponed wedding , and so on . However , this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another . The house seems more like a city . There 's also Leo G. Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no - one seems to even look at . He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious , but Drummond and the folks do n't seem to pick up on anything . Still , it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending.<br /><br />I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure , but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks , he is so buffoonish that it 's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him . Is there a history behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associates ?
0 A mix of Ninja stuff mixed with a sub - James Bond storyline . The result is incredibly awful and boring , being just the stage for endless gun battles . I ca n't believe this was released in theaters . Terminate this movie .
0 Shamefull as it may be , this movie actually made it to the videomarket , bringing shame on my proud country - any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing , will be a fruitless attempt . one can not bear to see more than one hour of this , then having either fallen asleep , or visited the bathroom for puking.<br /><br />Note : if you have n't seen anything else from Denmark , please remember this:<br /><br />some things were never meant to be - but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway !
0 This is really a very bad movie . Why ? First of all , the story is bad . It is an artificial story , combining all sorts of things together that make no sense . It just seems a wrong experiment . Secondly , the actors can not play in a realistic manner . They can not even talk as an actor should . Why did I buy this movie ? And what must I do with it now ?
0 Hello I am from Denmark , and one day i was having a film evening with my friends . One brought this movie with him " Russian terminator " and it was extremely awful . After watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable " highlights " or should i say " lowlights " in the movie . I was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland Denmark ... that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made .
0 A young basketball - playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence , using human fetuses . He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging . He 's pressured into concluding his research because he has n't published , so the university is having trouble justifying funding him ( I think).<br /><br />He does a trial injection on a monkey , which quickly dies . He then tries it on himself . He starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy ; she 's the one who had been demanding results from the research.<br /><br />Initially , he seems to have no effects from the injection , except some new strength . He then realizes that he had some memory loss , and starts recalling what happened . Additionally , he starts to appear very unhealthy.<br /><br />Since the movie is named metamorphosis , he does eventually change into something else . You wo n't believe your eyes - either what he turned into , or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he 's turned into . Incredibly , there 's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really , really absurd.<br /><br />About the only thing this movie has going for it is that Laura Gemser is in it , but she has a very small part.<br /><br />I'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover . Possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time , perhaps eyes that light up ( the main character 's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie ) . The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic , which had been removed . The novelty boxcover , if it still had it , would have been the only reason I would have held onto this movie ; I 'm definitely getting rid of it .
0 " Metamorphosis " hold a tiny bit of cult - value , simply because it was written and directed by George Eastman . This Italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid Joe D'Amato production during the late 70's / early 80 's . Would n't it be interesting for avid Euro - cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare - butted in " Erotic Nights of the Living Dead " all the time ? I thought so ! Now , unlike the movies he starred in , Eastman 's own " Metamorphosis " is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments . There are a handful of nasty murders , cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies ( a guest appearance by sleaze - queen Laura Gemser ! ) on display , but it 's mainly a talkative movie . The handsome & eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds . He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process , but if he does n't come up with detailed reports any time soon , his research will be stopped . So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins . Needless to say ( and like the title implies ) , he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker ! In other words , his research sucked ! Like the other reviewers already mentioned , this movie " borrows " a lot of ideas from David Cronenberg 's " The Fly "  the dramatic romance sub plot included - but does n't add any originality from its own . The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblum 's character in " The Fly " , whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible . The rapid - ageing - syndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodato 's sadly underrated giallo " Phantom of Death " , only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and did n't inflict it on himself . The physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films , though . Few scares or excitement to discover here , instead the movie features loads of bad acting , poor lighting , lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot . Feel free to skip this one .
0 All the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place : dialog riddled with biological techno - babble , chintzy sets , balsa - wood acting , a horrific late-'80s Casio score , and an overall look that suggests anything on the Sci - Fi Channel 's programming schedule , circa 1993 . Though " Metamorphosis " starts off with a lot of promise , the film unravels into bland idiocy and MST3K - style cheese as Clark Kent wannabe ' Doctor ' Peter Houseman ( Gene LeBrock ) is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects . But when he tests his vague experiment on himself , he transforms into a vaguely - defined creature ( that bears more than a passing resemblance to ' Dr. Freudstein ' from " House by the Cemetery " ) . The FX work is fairly good for such an obviously low - budget production ( though I suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason ) , but overall , " Metamorphosis " leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts , in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise . I ca n't help but agree with one character 's closing remark : " ( It was ) A nightmare ... from the past ! "
0 Meet Peter Houseman , rock star genetic professor at Virgina University . When he 's not ballin ' on the court he 's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures . Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal . I 'd want to be immortal too if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet female lovin that only VU can offer . An assortment of old and ugly university professors do n't care for the popular Houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results . This causes Peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum . Much to my amazement there are side effects and he , get this , metamorphoses ! into something that is embedded into our genetic DNA that has been repressed for " millions of years " . He also beds Dr. Mike 's crush Sally after a whole day of knowing her . She has a son . His name is Tommy . He is an angry little boy.<br /><br />Metamorphosis is n't a terrible movie , just not a well produced one . The whole time I watched this I could n't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 . The look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest . It does not help that it 's packaged along with 1970 's movies as Metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment 's 50 chilling classics . There is basically no film quality difference whatsoever . The final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually , for me at least , save the movie from a lower rating . Pay attention to the computer terminology such as " cromosonic anomaly " . No wonder Peter 's experiment failed . Your computer ca n't spell ! This is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern .
0 ' Metamoprhis ' is the story of a dashing young scientist , revered at the local college , is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college . This forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad - Hollywood melodramatic fashion.<br /><br />My first thought after this movies conclusion was this . " Not good , but not bad , for early - to - mid eighties . " Of course , I then realized that it was made in 1990 , which almost propelled it down to a ' 4 ' , but decided to keep it at the mediocre ' 5 ' that it is.<br /><br />'Metamorphis ' does on a few occasions , seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out . The acting , while not stellar , is mostly competent . You can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality . Pacing is a large problem with the movie . After thinking I had been watching for ninety minutes , I realized I 'd only been watching an hour . Special effects are n't stellar , but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.<br /><br />The lead , a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves , reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon 's character in ' Wild Things ' . The female heroine does an OK job , but does not distinguish herself in anyway . There 's a ' naughty girl ' role in here , and the actress does what she can with it , but it does n't seem like much . There is a child actor that the director ca n't decide if he 's morose , cheerful or just weird . < br /><br />Pacing , as I said , is the worst problem with this movie , until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush . It is bizarre and inexplicable , until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious , saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds.<br /><br />A decent one - time watch on the ' Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack ' . Nothing that is going to bring you back , and nothing to buy on its own .
0 It 's the same old , " If I ca n't get the funding for my project , I 'll inject myself " monster movie . There is nothing new here . It 's a lot like the Jeff Goldblum " Fly " movie . The man manages to keep some semblance of sanity , but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments . The acting is pretty bad . There are people acting stupidly all along the way , putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason . The guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter . Then there 's his relationship with a young woman and her son . Admittedly , he is good looking , but he seems like a lot of trouble . It 's just a pretty big waste of time . Even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a Star Trek convention .
0 METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set . Released in 1990 , METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of " The Atom Age Vampire , " which also featured a scientist striving for similar results . Set in modern times , METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie.<br /><br />A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging . Pressured by the administration to publish his papers ; and , produce some results ( or risk losing funding ) , the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig ! At first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects , he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner ! < br /><br />The acting is stilted ; and , the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film . The score is pandering . And , the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious ; it 's absurd ; it 's ridiculous  at best . < br /><br />As others noted , the end turns into a 30 + minute gag , which is seemingly endless . Without giving too much away , I 'd call this one , " Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone . "
0 As others have mentioned , this movie is similar to THE FLY ( both versions ) and the lesser known sci - fi flick ALTERED STATES . The big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it . METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages . METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles.<br /><br />The story follows scientist Dr. Peter Houseman ( Gene LeBrock ) , an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death . When the university he works for threatens to cut funding , he decides to inject the anti - aging serum into himself . As a result , Dr. Houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard . And oh yes , watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy . It really is so bad that it 's good . Some of the lines are classic : " What WAS it ? " " A nightmare ... from the past!" < br /><br />Many of the reviews that I 've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are . I 'm just going to go ahead and spoil it : the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half - man , half - lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected Godzilla costume , when the police finally gun him down . In the final scene , some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die , and the movie 's heroine , Sally Donnelly ( Catherine Baranov ) evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of Dr. Houseman . The camera then gives us a close - up of the lizard 's face ; this is , I assume , the director 's way of showing us that the lizard is EVIL . Yes , it is goofy , but I fell over laughing so I ca n't complain.<br /><br />I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased . I 'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing , as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on DVD . If you have recently bought the boxed set and have n't watched this movie yet , it really is worth your time , even if I did just ruin the ending for you . It might also be possible to find this movie online for free .
0 I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection , and one night I just decided to watch it ; though not expecting much . As the beginning credits roll around I 'm surprised to discover this film was made under the Filmirage company . Filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as " Troll 2 " , " Ator the Invincible " , and " Quest for the Mighty Sword " , so I was compelled to watch.<br /><br />As the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent , even though it was unoriginal . The gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent . But after a while into the film , the pace started dragging and I found myself thinking " Okay someone better get killed soon",or " Someone better mutate " . At the onset of this drag , when I was having these thoughts , though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated , however as noted , the gore and effects were n't very good . What made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing ; example : first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo , then he 'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone , finally he 'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed-- making the audience ask " Was he dreaming he was at the zoo ? " . Like the movie 's pace , these scene transitions got progressively worse.<br /><br />I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was pretty good , but towards the end of the film , that is , once you 've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into , hopefully you 'll laugh-- which really , is the only reason to see this movie at least once ; this movie unintentionally runs like a long - winded joke.<br /><br />The costume of the um , thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D ' Amato 's " Quest for the Mighty Sword " , which was made in the same year . You 've got ta love Filmirage movies , they 're always re - using the same stuff !
0 Ha . without a doubt Tommy 's the evil one here . i do n't know why , but for some reason , little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches . and since they 're kids , they wo n't die . because they 're annoying ... well .. except for asylum of terror . but those are few and far between.<br /><br />Anyway onto the movie . Ca n't find this movie on DVD ? sure you can ! all you have to do is buy the Chilling classics DVD pack ! not only do you get Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15 , but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES ! what a bargain ! pff . OK . i 'm done advertising for these cheesy movies . let 's just say , this movie ai n't worth the 15 bucks on its own.<br /><br />So we have a chemist scientist . yeah . cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing Peter . He 's trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body . the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project , so he tries it on himself . but because this is a horror movie , he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3/4 of the movie.<br /><br />To pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son . and she was never married ! scandalous ! But of course Tommy is one of the most irritating characters .... no . i take it back . HE IS the most irritating character . Far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter 's work and gloats over him while he 's in the hospital . that 's right , even as an old cripple , you can still be the villain.<br /><br />So we see Peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he 's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal . However at the end he ends up de - evolving into a lizard . yeah , i know do n't ask . The ending really does n't make any sense . And if you 're hoping for any really good payoff , you 're not going to get it.<br /><br />This is n't a HORRIBLE movie .... it 's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff . if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list , you 're not in for a snoozer , but you 're also not in for a great movie . Just sit back , relax , and eat a lot of snack food . Because this movie is n't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon.<br /><br />Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads , out of 10 .
0 First let me be honest . I did not watch all this movie . I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on ... It did n't . This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become : a decent horror movie . Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made . This film is n't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it . Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you wo n't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung .
0 Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is mild , inoffensive and lacklustre . The story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles . A tail of two ' traumatised ' children learning about ' God ' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised . It uses the Irish ' blarney ' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it . Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an ' OIRISH ' accent . All in all why do they pump these out .
0 This mini series , also based on a book by Alex Haley as was ` Queen ' , tried to use similar formulas , that is , constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years . Whereas in ` Queen ' the result was masterful , here in Mama Flora the inspiration was lacking . Firstly perhaps in the book itself , and most certainly in this TV production . Too much is put in with too much haste over the years , such that the unfolding saga is shallow , superficial , not nearly so authentic as in ` Queen ' . Full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film , which was prepared with great care , but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian - forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration . I had hoped for more ; but evidently Haley was less inspired with this tale than his near - biographical ` Queen ' , and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman . Only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up .
0 Anemic comedy - drama , an unhappy , seemingly rushed affair featuring Cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit - man who 's been hired to kill her by her husband . Chazz Palminteri , as the talkative hired gun , adapted the screenplay from his own play , with stagy set - ups and back - and - forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear . An air of gloom hangs over the entire project , and director Paul Mazursky ca n't get Cher out of her perpetual funk ( she 's listless ) . Despite all the top talent ( including Robert De Niro as one of the producers ) , " Faithful " is fraudulent , with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they 're two different mediums . Do you think it 's a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play ? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping " Blimey there 's thousands of them out there " Great movie and a bad stage play < br /><br />In order for a stage play to make great cinema there 's two essentials needed < br /><br />1 ) A fine cast that creates on screen chemistry < br /><br />2 ) Great dialogue < br /><br />On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . The story revolves around a hit - man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which ca n't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . Since the story is very static it 's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead
0 Minimal script , minimal character development , minimal steady camera . Maximum stretched scenes , maximum headache inducing jerky zooms , maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing . Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm , you can fast forward and miss nothing , since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing . To be fair , the movie does have some string music that was interesting , so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this . Unfortunately that was not to be , and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief . Forget about " Trigger Man " , I know I am trying to . - MERK
0 " Trigger Man " is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I 've ever seen in my life . My aunt 's holiday videos are more fascinating.<br /><br />The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com . They do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner.<br /><br />They walk and walk and walk through the forest . There 's more walking - around than in all three parts of " The Lord of the Rings " together . After the first hour , I began to read a Porsche brochure while watching " Trigger Man " along the way . Awful.<br /><br />A total waste of time and money . I 'd give that movie 0 stars out of 10 , since this is not possible , I have to give 1 star .
0 I have seen poor movies in my time , but this really takes the biscuit ! Why oh why has this film been made ? There just is nothing here whatsoever . Please put your trust in me , flick the off switch and destroy your copy of this film . There is a plot ... that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera . This is the key problem , the story ' based on a true story ' ( mmm ... whatever ) just in no way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes . And so we therefore have to sit through over an hour of watching people walk around . That is it ! In the whole first half an hour absolutely nothing happens , apart from watching someone walk to a shop ... and then 3 guys walking through a wood . This time could perhaps have been spent on developing character ... but no . And so there is absolutely no connection to the people on screen , and so when they start to get shot , we could n't care less ! In fact I was in the end vouching for the baddie so that the film would end ! On top of this the camera work is truly horrific ! This director / editor / writer / producer , Ti West is rubbish . I hate to hit a guy , but really , his work is pants ! These dull close ups continuously , and then long single takes following people as they walk - I 'm sure he thinks he 's clever , but the results are so dull I just wanted to stop the film and slit my wrists ! How this man has been brought on to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me ! To finish , the acting is also woeful , ... which goes for the film as a whole . Preserve your sanity , stick clear of this heap of total excrement !
0 Contains spoilers The movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences : Three guys go hunting in the forest . Two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation . The last guy can stand in the clear , shout and do anything without getting shot . He gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle . The villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains.<br /><br />That is the whole story , not summarized but in detail . Everything is drawn out with a guy standing ringing a door bell . We wait with him . Long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping . We can take a nap with them . The one drawn out shot of following a female jogger could have been redeeming , if we could see her butt or boobs bouncing.<br /><br />There dialog is less then Terminator and it is not because there is so much action . The characters just do n't talk . And , then they do n't even have something corny to say like ' I 'll be back . ' If my buddy shot this on the weekend , I 'd cheer for him , because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls . To pay money to rent this as a DVD is totally inappropriate.<br /><br />The one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling , how they local police did n't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun . If they 'd have filmed that , I 'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie .
0 The story is seen before , but that does'n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard . It is clear that the director have n't spent his work on the storyboard . Alongside this , the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie . The funniest is , however , if you take a look at the movie 's website , you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles . Because it remind us about hunting . But I have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It will have 1 stars because the story is OK . It is a pity that Ti West , has not spent more time to review his story . It is as if the movie was more important than the planning . Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away ... come . Everyone can make a movie , but not all will be just as good . So a word of advice to Ti West are : stop and labeling what you want . Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard . You certainly have the ability and desire - so do n't abuse your talent .
0 This movie is very very very poor . I have seen better movies . < br /><br />There was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair . It begins slowly with the building of tension . Which is not a success . At least if you ask me . Though at some points or moments I must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down.<br /><br />They should had made it something like Scary Movie , then it might be a better movie . Because I watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie . I must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so I sure can say it is not worth it.<br /><br />Don't waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is . Somewhere very dusty ..
0 In the first 20 minutes , every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director . There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life ; the politically - tortured NTSB board member played by [ I can kill ANY TV ] Ted McGinley ; the tortured father of a crash victim ; and the torturing sleazy ambulance - chasing lawyer.<br /><br />Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft . The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap . The first third of the fuselage was intact , the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines . Most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics . Most of this TV plane was n't even burned.<br /><br />It reminded me of the scene in " Air Force One " where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it 's made of inch - thick steel.<br /><br />The show was so bad it was impossible to watch . Even my wife , who is more accepting than I , was commenting on technical flaws . What had me stunned was how this POS could ever get made . Are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they ca n't even recognize them ? Somebody read this script and said : Yes , I want to spend a million bucks making this real . I wish I was the guy 's next appointment . I have title to a wonderful bridge in New York that I 'd sell cheap .
0 This is n't the worst movie I 've ever seen , but I really ca n't recall when I 've seen a worse one . I thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation . What it really was is a soap opera , and a bad one at that . They overplayed the ' conflict ' card to the extreme . The first hour or so seems like a shouting match , with some implausible scenes thrown in.<br /><br />*Possible spoiler*<br /><br />The 40-or - so minute ' memorial ' scene ( with requisite black umbrellas and rain ) to fictitious crash victims was lame , and I thought it would never end . < br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs , unless you revel in ' conflict'.<br /><br / >
0 Weaker entry in the Bulldog Drummond series , with John Howard in the role . Usual funny banter and antics , but not much plot . Barrymore gets something to do as the inspector , swapping disguises to follow Drummond , Algy , and Tenny on a wild goose chase ( mostly in circles ; perhaps the budget was tighter than usual ) to rescue poor Phyllis , who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom . For those keeping score , in this one , Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby 's christening . It 's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at The Angler 's Rest , but little of it rises above silly .
0 Though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series , BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES , this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that 's less thrilling and a leading man who simply does n't have the charisma of Ray Milland.<br /><br />That said , several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying . Also John Barrymore is present , popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises.<br /><br />Anyway it 's another endless night for BD as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry . The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining .
0 I had heard ( and read ) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series ( like Entourage , Sopranos or Mad Men ) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One . ( did n't make it past the first six episodes ) < br /><br />The writing was unoriginal , contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing . The dialog felt forced , like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.<br /><br />The characters never developed enough for me to care about them , they were selfish and unappealing . I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother - in - law ( who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator ) and the removal of the Hodes ' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché , I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer 's loyalty.<br /><br />Episode after episode I liked the characters less and could n't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.<br /><br />Add to that I heard that Season Two was n't as good , so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.<br /><br />If you 're a fan of good casting and writing , I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like , unless of course you 're stoned and then all bets are off .
0 Do n't get me wrong , I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy . I shall digress now . The writing , though , was unrealistic . A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person . Give me a break . The smugness of very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence . The characters were not at all likable . Basically , the plot lines went nowhere . I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant . Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this .... WHY ? ? ? ? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness . Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status . OK not exactly the same thing , but I think you people get my point . That save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails , I guess , but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom , as the local pot dealer .
0 Another turgid action / adventure flick from the Quinn Martin Productions factory . Roy Thinnes plays undercover agent Diamond Head ( Mr. Head , to you ) , working for his G - Man handler " Aunt Mary " , looking for " Tree " , who 's on a mission to ... well , just watch the movie . < br /><br />This one deserved and got the full MST3 K sendup . As the boys and various reviewers have pointed out , the movie " Fargo " had more Hawaiian locations than this film . Apparently shot on a puny budget , this movie highlights Hawaii 's broken - down dive shops , gas stations , and cheapo hotels . Zulu -- later to star as Kono in Hawaii - Five - O -- appears as Thinnes ' lumpy , inept sidekick , while France Nguyen models the Jenny Craig diet gone horribly wrong . Others sharing the flickering screen include a drunken Richard Harris knockoff , a George Takai imitator , a not - so - smart hit - man with sprayed - on Sansabelt slacks , and the villain " Tree " , sporting a veddy British accent . You can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits , but relax -- just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70 's movie - of - the - week.<br /><br />Whenever I think of this movie ( and I think of this movie often ) , I catch myself humming the theme , written for flute and tuba ... no one knows why . < br /><br />Trivia note -- Diamond Head was directed by Jeannot Szwarc , one of three contract directors at Universal who would go on to make much bigger films , in his case Jaws 2 . The others were John Badham ( War Games ) , and a young fellow named Steven Spielberg ...
0 It does n't take long to see why Code Name : Diamond Head did n't make it onto the network schedules . The TV pilot movie does n't get past the credits before it 's obvious just how bad it 's going to be . Maybe I missed something , because the plot did n't make a whole lot of sense . Based on what I got out of the muddled mess , a terrorist or thief or something named " Tree " ( Ian McShane ) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon . The world 's dullest secret agent , Johnny Paul ( Roy Thinnes ) , is out to stop him . There might have been more , but trust me  it really does n't matter anyway.<br /><br />Action movies should have action . Suspenseful moments should have suspense . And dramatic moments should have drama . There 's none of that in Code Name : Diamond Head . I 've seen others use the word " turgid " to describe this made for TV snoozer  and it 's better than any one word description I can come up with . None of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about . And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable . His charisma is just slightly north of a slug . Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it , but unfortunately for everyone else involved , it does n't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member . Now if McShane had been cast in the series lead , well then you might have had something.<br /><br />I'm quickly discovering that these Gawd awful 70s made - for - TV movies make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes . And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved . Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots . So while I may only give the movie a 3/10 , I rate Episode # 608 a 4/5 on my MST3 K rating scale .
0 Ahh , the dull t.v . shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70 's to make equally dull t.v . movies ! Some examples would be Riding With Death(the most hysterically cheesy of the lot ) , Stranded in Space(confusing and uninteresting ) , San Francisco International(horribly dull and unbelievably confusing ) , and this turgid bit of Quinn Martin glamor . < br /><br />Shot in Hawaii(although you would n't know it from the outside shots ) , it 's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show . The real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters , including the drab main character Diamond Head , who seemed half asleep for the entire movie ; his boss ' Aunt Mary ' , who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on ; Diamnd Head 's girlfriend / fellow agent(hell , I ca n't even remember her name ) a skinny , wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting ; and the singing sidekick Zulu(again , i ca n't remember his character 's name)who was n't bad in small doses . The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane , who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops . Alothugh the make - up jobs this so - called ' chameleon ' used to disguise himself were just laughable . I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a South American Dictator cum American General . Nor do I care . The plot simply was n't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time , let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on . Just call this one - Hawaii Five No !
0 Think of this pilot as " Hawaii Five - O Lite " . It 's set in Hawaii , it 's an action / adventure crime drama , lots of scenes feature boats and palm trees and polyester fabrics and garish shirts ... it even stars the character actor " Zulu " in a supporting role . Oh , there are some minor differences - Roy Thinnes is supposed to be some front - line undercover agent , and the supporting cast is much smaller ( and less interesting ) , but basically the atmosphere is still the same . Problem is , " Hawaii Five - O " ( another QM product ) already existed at the time and had run for years . It filled the market demand for Hawaii - based crime dramas quite adequately . Code Name : Diamond Head may have been intended as the hier to H50 as the older series eventually dwindled away ... but it comes across as a superfluous , 2nd rate copy . It does n't suck , but it 's completely derivative and does n't do anything as well as the original.<br /><br />There is some decent acting talent involved here . Thinnes is an old pro , and he gives the role his best shot , and he is n't bad . But Thinnes is only as good as his material and his director . Ian McShane is in here as an evil spy master named " Tree " , and McShane tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in . But he 's phoning his part in here . Frances Ngyuen is reasonably exotic looking , but her astounding skinniness , opaque features , thick accent and wooden delivery are n't the stuff of which dreams are made . Relying on her to supply the ' romantic interest ' for Thinnes was probably the series ' biggest mistake . At least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with Marsha Brady and Peggy Lee as our love goddesses . Give her another 30 lbs and a year with a dialog / voice coach , and she might cut it . Zulu is , well , his usual self - enjoyable in bit parts , but he is n't a person who can carry a feature by himself . < br /><br />In addition , the plot and dialog are strictly by - the - numbers , with nothing to distinguish them from any other Quinn Martin production . And by this point , the American TV audience had seen a whoooole lot of QM productions .... I think " CN : DH " was one too many , and it sank without a trace . It was n't the really the actors ' fault , and I hope they walked away from this with a decent paycheck and one more entry on their C.V.s . < br /><br />MST3000 revived this for their treatment in their sixth season , and they had a lot of good natured fun with it . Worth seeking out in that version if you enjoy the MST approach to movie japery and lampoon , but I ca n't imagine anyone caring about this pilot for any other reason .
0 This series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing : Made Ian McShane Code Name : Diamond Head instead of Code Name : Tree . Diamond Head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue , which McShane proved he could do with the Lovejoy series . Roy Thinnes , the actual Diamond Head , is really only so - so in the role . McShane is not really that good as the bad guy Tree . France Nuyen 's character , Tso - Tsing , ca n't seem to make up her mind as to whether she 's the hapless victim or the tough - and - ready - to - fight woman . She really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of Diamond Head 's lover . After viewing an episode or two , I ended up not caring what happened to anyone . Tree gives us a lot to hate him , but Diamond Head gives us nothing to like him . Unfortunately , the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960 's .
0 TV pilots , do n't you love them ? Quinn Martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other TV detective movies , but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of MST where it belongs . Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find super spy Lovejoy , I mean Tree . Zulu and Tso - Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else . Tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does . There 's more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine ( required in the 1970's)and the show itself is so anti - climatic . Why did it not go to series ? You figure it out , it 's quite blatant . Again it 's fun for MST , but not a lot else ! !
0 I 'm not going to approach and critique the theories of RAW . I mean , this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well - made , and not a site debating philosophy.<br /><br />Having said that , this video really blows . It 's one talking - head shot of RAW after another . Some of it is archival video , so you can see how he has aged over the years , and that 's pretty cool . But , otherwise , the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous.<br /><br />It 's a strange comparison , but I kept thinking of the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle * Funny Lady * ( another really bad movie ) . After a while , I was so OD'd on Barbra , I kept wishing there would be one scene that she would n't appear in : you know , a " meanwhile , other characters in the movie were up to something else ... " moment . But it was all about Barbra . Well this video is RAW 's * Funny Lady*. < br /><br />So , if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of RAW while he prattles on with his theories , assembled in a lame structure that does n't add any interest or insight , then be my guest . For me , I could n't take it after 20 minutes .

0 A complete waste of time < br /><br />Halla Bol is a complete waste of time . The script and dialogues are poorly written , the direction is lacklustre and the acting borders on hammy . This movie was clearly aiming for the Rang De Basanti crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made RDB connect with its audience_great script , terrific acting , good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown.<br /><br />Compared to that near - masterpiece , Halla Bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero taking a leak on the villain 's Persian rug and the hero 's mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less ! All of this might have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a downturn in movie quality and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits , but movie - making has become_should have become_more subtle and thoughtful of late.<br /><br />Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it ! He resorts to sermonizing without a care as to the audience 's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say . Maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans.<br /><br />Even if you do n't agree with everything I say , you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much much better and Mr . Santoshi should have left the industry - bashing to Om Shanti Om . Industry - bashing ? That 's right!!Santoshi has depicted the industry as a place of back - biting , bitching and the casting couch which the hero happily indulges in with a starlet curiously named Sania . There are some people who will think that these portions show the real face of the industry . Do n't believe everything you see!<br /><br />All in all , raise your voice against movies like this and do n't spend your hard - earned money on this bomb.<br /><br / > * out of * * * * .
0 I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring Hip Hop , but was disappointed on many levels . First of all , the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable . Second , the setting , acting and story are not very authentic or believable . Third , there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks . How about some originality ? Third , there were very few Hip Hop songs played in entirity - if any . None seemd really central . Overall , film was a great disappointment , but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile .
0 This is the first of these " 8 Films To Die For " collection that I 've seen and it 's certainly not made me want to see any of the rest ... although I 've heard at least a couple of them are decent . I do n't know , this was n't terrible but it did n't really do much for me . Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing , mom & dad died , the family sold the farm & moved to San Francisco ( ? ) where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible . The best part of this was the creepy Goth sister , who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves . Anyway , of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on . This family is sort of like the white - bread version of the Sawyer Clan , they 're nasty & they do bad things but they ai n't go no soul . I see a lot of reviews from people that liked this , and I guess I do n't know what I missed , but I found it to be very mediocre & I would n't recommend it to anyone , really . 4 out of 10 .
0 Like most of the festivals entries Hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film that s all ideas and little execution . Although impressive for it 's obvious low budget the film falters in it 's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it 's drawn out and obvious conclusion . The film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died . They kidnap people , drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement . There 's some nice darkly humorous performances from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so - so . The film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter . But for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment . The next half is n't so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap . It 's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative . too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level.<br /><br />**/5
0 This is the first film of the Horrorfest I have watched and after I m almost thinking I do n't need to see any of the others . I was told its a " thinking mans horror movie " and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think I shutter to think what the splatter / gore films in the collection will be like . Do n't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through.<br /><br />The plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake . The camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least . Several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the hooks of " The Hamiltons " . I figured out who Lenny was about half hour in when I figured out the movie . I was so visually under whelmed and confused by the Lenny reveal that I completely felt ripped off . I expected what I got but they could have gone so much further , in fact all the gore falls completely flat . With movies out there like " Hostel " and " Saw " you need to come a little better for a film that is " considered to graphic or too disturbing for general audiences " .
0 ... that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there.<br /><br />Near Dark covered the same territory but with much more class , and action.<br /><br />why the script kept their ' big secret ' so long was a total mystery to me - I guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film . By the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of ' big deal , tell me something I do n't know.'<br /><br />I found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions , unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror . This was woeful
0 Without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity , all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling , unoriginal elements . ' Party of Five ' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there 's little rooting interest because the singular non - homicidal element is a second - rate bland awful - acting ' Wes Bentley ' mopester . In fact , all of the acting is skin deep . Even though the dark - haired women appeal , the salaciousness is kept to a minimum . No nudity here . Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood . All sensations are kept at a teasing , safe distance ... an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is ' butcher . ' Only the soundtrack , the droning angsty alt - country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension . Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low - angles that adds to the malaise ... but for a film that calls itself horror , I did not even get close to flinching once . Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake , scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square , and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family 's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion , but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest .
0 I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad " horror " film . Do n't waste your time or money on this film , the acting is bad , the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful . Nothing about it was good , you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap . The plot had so many holes in it and they never got cleared up in the end , it was just so bad , i do n't know how a film so terrible could be made . As i said before i love horror films and i was so let down , it was an 18 but you see little blood and no scares or jumps at all . Also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing , why ? is all i can say . Just do n't bother , there are far more great horror films out there , just do n't waste your time life is too short .
0 This is so bad , so very very bad . The acting is the biggest joke in history . Do n't even bother to see it , i did ff it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning ... I really do n't understand peoples taste , I 'm a horror movie fan and I 'm not fastidious but I DO HAVE A LIMIT ! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of The Hoast but that 's it . So I recommend you do n't waste the 15 minutes you 'll be able to watch . I mean the acting is better done by monkeys . And the big brother with the parental role is just awful . Do n't they pay characters in C - movies ? No I must say it 's not the first time I think a horror movie is bad but it 's absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with Portrait of a vampire , Cabin by the lake , The Hoast !
0 When a film is independent and not rated , such as the Hamiltons , I was expecting out of the norm , cut out your heart violence . I know that good movies do n't always contain blood and violence , but I read reviews , I visited the website , and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this god awful movie with me . When there is a festival called Horrorfest , I am expecting horror , not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones . My expectations were extremely low for this film , yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger . There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination . I regret not seeing Happy Feet . I think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons !
0 The Hamiltons tells the story of the four Hamilton siblings , teenager Francis ( Cory Knauf ) , twins Wendell ( Joseph McKelheer ) & Darlene ( Mackenzie Firgens ) & the eldest David ( Samuel ) who is now the surrogate parent in charge . The Hamilton 's move house a lot , Franics is unsure why & is unhappy with the way things are . The fact that his brother 's & sister kidnap , imprison & murder people in the basement does n't help relax or calm Francis ' nerves either . Francis know 's something just is n't right & when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same again ... <br /><br />Co - written , co - produced & directed by Mitchell Altieri & Phil Flores as The Butcher Brothers ( who 's only other film director 's credit so far is the April Fool 's Day ( 2008 ) remake , enough said ) this was one of the ' Films to Die For ' at the 2006 After Dark Horrorfest ( or whatever it 's called ) & in keeping with pretty much all the other 's I 've seen I thought The Hamiltons was complete total & utter crap . I found the character 's really poor , very unlikable & the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it 's 85 & a half minute too long 86 minute duration . The there 's the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud , there 's this really big sustained build up to what 's inside a cupboard thing in the Hamiltons basement & it 's eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy . Is that really supposed to scare us ? Is that really supposed to shock us ? Is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll ? Is a harmless looking young boy the best ' twist ' ending that the makers could come up with ? The boring plot plods along , it 's never made clear where the Hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work ( except David in a slaughterhouse & I doubt that pays much ) or why they have n't been caught before now . The script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror & it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective . A really bad film that I am struggling to say anything good about.<br /><br />Despite being written & directed by the extreme sounding Butcher Brothers there 's no gore here , there 's a bit of blood splatter & a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you could n't do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup & a camcorder . The film is neither scary & since it 's got a very middle - class suburban setting there 's zero atmosphere or mood . There 's a lesbian & suggest incestuous kiss but The Hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale & there 's not much here for the horror crowd.<br /><br />Filmed in Petaluma in California this has that modern low budget look about it , it 's not badly made but rather forgettable . The acting by an unknown ( to me ) cast is nothing to write home about & I ca n't say I ever felt anything for anyone.<br /><br />The Hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull & boring from which it never recovers . Add to that an ultra thin story , no gore , a rubbish ending & character 's who you do n't give a toss about & you have a film that did not impress me at all .
0 This movie was so bad I do n't know whether to laugh or cry . I had high hopes for Horrorfest that year , which was also the first year I attended Horrorfest , and I have to say Horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level . Mad kudos to the advertisers because I 'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year . The Hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones I 've seen ( the other ones I saw were Unrest , Dark Ride , and Reincarnation ) . The movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which I thought was a rather interesting plot , only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some ' coming of age ' tale about a boy 's transition into being a vampire . Which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film . And to make the plot even more ridiculous , they add in a set of horny twins who ca n't wait to take a ' bite ' out of one another , and some deadly creature locked in the basement , which if I had discovered what ' it ' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film , I would have left the theater halfway into the movie.<br /><br />Complete waste of money and time . Cut forty minutes out of this film , and make it into an episode on some show like Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural and it would have received more praise than this . Absolute rubbish ! So bad that two years later , I have to come back to IMDb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Also , while you 're reading this , steer clear from the rest of the Horrorfest movies in the future . The most you could do is rent them from Blockbusters or watch it online somewhere . Horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who ca n't make it onto the big screen , and all the crap about ' stuff they do n't show you in theaters ' , they were n't referring to blood or guts , or horror ... they were referring to the movies themselves . Because they 're horrendous . Think of Horrorfest as a less renowned version of Sundance Film Festival , but for horror movies.<br /><br />Sorry for all the ' hate ' , but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money .
0 When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original . Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre , and I mean it only cost three quid ( around $ 6 ) . To be honest I do n't think it was even worth that.<br /><br />It seemed like the directors- the ' butcher brothers ' could n't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror . It ended up with a cliché ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you could n't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest was n't needed.<br /><br />The only good part really was the middle / end- I wo n't ruin it for you . But that was the only " good " part.<br /><br />Overall a pointless watch . It felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes . If you want an artsy film - don't bother . If you want a slasher movie- do n't bother- The film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening .
0 This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past weekend , The Gravedancers being the first . Gravedancers was better . I can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited . I will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end . We were n't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying . I have to mention that there was also a bit of mis - casting with a 12-year - old boy acting as Sheriff . The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was , which turned out to not be all that interesting . Some more background about the family would have helped but they did n't really seem like a family at all to begin with.<br /><br />To me , this film is so amateur that I could n't even see putting it on DVD . The four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had . This was one to skip for horrorfest .
0 Just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the " thing " in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street . Of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling.<br /><br />For me this just did n't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film . the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking , something it never really is . It does n't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an " oh " , as on " Oh that s it ? " . Maybe if I had n't been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since I would n't have compared it to so much.<br /><br />I'd take a pass
0 Wow , could have been such a good movie , Starts of with Brittany Daniels tied up , I m thinking cool we are going to get a flash back , but nothing , movie starts anew with the kid filming . This movie probably would have been better if it was n't for the acting . I mean the acting was mostly horrible .. Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could .. Still it really ruin the movie for me .. The twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills .. The movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion .. All in all I have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for I was very disappointed .. By the way , were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff . Did I see the same movie .. Well this is 4 out of the eight , and so far only one has been any good ..
0 WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.<br /><br />Although I have n't seen them all , The Hamiltons sure did deliver one lowsy piece of entertainment , which it did not entertain me at all!!!!I thought that in common with the semi - bad acting , stupid plot scheme , and the twist at the end of the movie , which was very retarded , this movie sucked!!!Okay , so supposively these are people who eat other people . Yeah ...... notice I said people not humans , not because they are n't human , or wait I think they are , OH NO WAIT , THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU!!!!!So okay , are these people cannibals , or are they imbreds , or what are THEY!!!!I mean , maybe they 're just " THINGS " that came here to see what people taste like or , are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now , or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE!!WHICH IT WAS!!!So if you think The Hamiltons is good , I ask of you , why , why , WHY , WHY , why was it so awesome , because to me it was just flat out terrible!!!One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons!!!Go see The Gravedancers , Tooth & Nail , or Borderland for a piece of entertainment ! ! ! ! !
0 If you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Butcher Brothers have n't grasped this yet.<br /><br />This film sucks , unlike the majority of its characters who ( if you did n't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you ) preference stringing up the plentiful supply of ' no one knows where I am ' cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger , past their isolated door.<br /><br />The only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy.<br /><br />Forced to up sticks ( as opposed stakes ) on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses , they really are none too bright . If they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate , thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy.<br /><br />Why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother I am not sure . It added zero to the plot , which was unfortunate given that there was n't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all.<br /><br />One was never told why the parents had died , unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks . Clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again , it was for the viewer to write their own reason.<br /><br />The only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like Pugsley from the Adams Family . Indeed he was way too rounded , having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a Weight watchers ' class in to a very bad horror film . Oh heavens , he had . Never mind dear , have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre .
0 i rate this movie with 3 skulls , only coz the girls knew how to scream , this could 've been a better movie , if actors were better , the twins were OK , i believed they were evil , but the eldest and youngest brother , they sucked really bad , it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them .... spoiler : if they 're vampire 's why do they freeze the blood ? vampires ca n't drink frozen blood , the sister in the movie says let 's drink her while she is alive .... but then when they 're moving to another house , they take on a cooler they 're frozen blood . end of spoiler < br /><br />it was a huge waste of time , and that made me mad coz i read all the reviews of how this movie was great , how many awards this movie won , and this movie was f****ing s**t ! ! ! !
0 Terrible acting , lame plot , stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk . It was excruciating to sit through . Just awful . Do not waste one penny on this . The movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch . This " horror " film was not even in the least bit scary , creepy or disturbing . It was in no way visually appealing . The acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor / actress opening their mouth . Plus the entire story , i do n't know why someone would make a movie with this story AGAIN . Do not waste your time or money . Even if it 's a free ticket do n't waste one moment viewing this movie . You will feel dumber for watching it .
0 I was looking forward to this ride , and was horribly disappointed.<br /><br />And I am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides.<br /><br />The roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride . < br /><br />It was visually dull and poorly executed . < br /><br />It was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland , and failed in every aspect.<br /><br />It was not thrilling or exciting in the least .
0 The basic plot in this movie is n't bad . A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored . But , despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden , the movie is a mess . The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both , as her performance is just awful . Instead of being a real person , she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights . In other words , she stares off into space and has a " golly I am SOOOO stunned " expression . After just a few minutes it really became annoying for me . Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I dislike for her performance , as she had done more than her share of overacting -- in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films , such as BERSERK ! My advice is to try a different Crawford film -- there certainly were better .
0 Ridiculous fluff , that compounds its error by trying to have meaning . Joan , this time as a congresswoman , Agatha Reed , chairwoman of a committee dedicated to " investigating the high cost of food . " Says Congresswoman Reed , " The housewife has been getting it in the neck too long . I 'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the American family can take a vacation once a year , see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant . " She 's all business , but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from Good Hope College , where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night ( the parallel to Joan 's real life is unmistakable here , as it is in all Joan Movies ) . The degree causes much consternation on campus ( " That would make it the most broad - minded institution in the history of education ! " )  but Joan is unaware of this as she arrives . The college president , Jim Merrill , played by Robert Young , at his handsomest , happens to be Joan 's former teacher  and lover . It was with * him * that she spent the night out , all those years ago , but Joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married . Naturally , this high - profile event will be covered by * Life * magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be ? Yet another of Joan 's old lovers  this one , she hung out with in China " during the war " , and he thinks Joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame . Eve Arden , playing Joan 's assistant , " Woodie , " is at her butchest and most smart - alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job , if you did n't like her so much . But you not only like Eve in this , as in all her roles , you adore her . She is so droll and no - nonsense , you 'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys . When Joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater , Eve tells her it " looks fierce . " But Joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings , she , Joan , sees youth  herself at 18 " eager , expectant  a little frightened , asking ' What is life ? What am I ? ' " But , of course , if we actually go into depth about Joan at 18 , the truth may be a little different . < br /><br />For me , this is the major problem in watching any Joan movie . You can call her characters whatever you want to , but it 's always all Joan , all the time . So , since what we 're always seeing is Joan being herself , it 's easy to dispense with character 's names . It 's just that it gets confusing when Joan tries to tell us something patently untrue , like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 , Joan had already been around the block several times . Many men would have described her as eager , and as far as being expectant , she had already had several abortions at this point . But that 's a personal problem , and I digress , but I simply wanted to explain why I say things such as "  and then Joan does  " this or that , or " We see Joan as ... " when we are not literally watching a home movie.<br /><br />There is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which Joan is given the Clara Bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that Joan and Clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe Joan is much younger than she actually looks . It fails . What also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness . In the story , Joan has written a book about free speech and made a film ( no , not the one about the plumber ) , and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical , Dr. Pitt , who is about to be fired for his views , which are shockingly similar to Joan 's . This is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one , to be sure , but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion .
0 This film reminded me so much of " A History of Violence " which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence . Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble . Do n't these men have a job ? Anyway , Dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone , feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap . Funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small British town except maybe put a mans head in it.<br /><br />Sam Peckinpah who made the " Wild Bunch " which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared . But it was done with style , and you believed it . Straw Dogs is not believable . First of all the location is wrong and does not work . Why place it in England ? I would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the American South in the 1930 's or something . Second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife.<br /><br />Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on this one .
0 My life is about saving animals . I do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization . I am a vegetarian because I could n't kill an animal even to sustain my life . I ca n't even kill a spider , I put it outdoors . The scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies , with Sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children , made me sick and has haunted me ever since . It simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance . The ending - the foster parents adopt Sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty . Why would anyone want their child to see this film ?
0 You get a gift . It is exquisitely wrapped . The box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail . That is then wrapped in gorgeous paper , handmade and hand - painted by the most talented of artists . The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace . It is a sight to behold.<br /><br />Then you cut the ribbon , rip off the paper , open up the box , and find ... nothing . That 's TOYS . You either enjoy the packaging , or forget about it.<br /><br />The film is n't without its point and purpose : War is a not a good thing . Well , is n't that original ! The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out . And even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing , until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys . It 's like someone preaching a stern , condescending sermon , only to end by saying " Just kidding." < br /><br />But even as an empty box , the film fails close scrutiny . Yes , it is a sight to behold with some remarkable , striking images . The sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill . But the images are cold and emotionally sterile . Like the screenplay , the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal . It is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things , yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold . The film strives to be funny , in a morose sort of way , but the humor is forced and artificial . Robin Williams , as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire , tosses in his ad - lib shtick , which only seems alien to the bizarre , coldly structured world he is inhabiting . Indeed , the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be . For this film to work , or make sense , it needs to be set in its own universe , an Oz far removed from Kansas . Every time the jokes jerk us back into reality , the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.<br /><br />It is said that this was director Barry Levinson 's pet project , one that he had been striving to get made for ten years . It is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing . Like most pet projects that finally get made ( RADIOLAND MURDERS , RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD : EARTH being great examples ) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker 's field of vision . Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage . He had already perfected it to death.<br /><br />Many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy , mechanical , wind - up monstrosities . So is the film itself .
0 Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue . It initially looks great but ultimately provides NO satisfaction -- none.<br /><br />The plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil . So , how is it possible that with this basic plot AND Robin Williams that the movie still turns out so badly ? ! It 's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever -- much like the terrible Popeye picture Williams did at the beginning of his film career . The film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there was n't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school.<br /><br />The film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on . I really am unsure why it was made in the first place -- it certainly was n't made to provide any sort of entertainment .
0 Sometimes , making something strange and contemporary does n't always work to everyone 's advantage . While I will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting , the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just did n't work . This film was so hideously slow and pointless , not even Robin Williams could save this garbage . It 's obvious Barry Levinson 's dream fell flat on its face , but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop .
0 I truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as I was a huge fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad . Until this . This complete trash ruined Robin for me for a long time . I 'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in Fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake , Bicenntinial Man i think it was called but the point is . Robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this ' classic ' .
0 " Laughter is a state of mind " says the tag , and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson 's . What could he have been thinking during the making of " Toys " ? When he watched the rushes , did he see a successful , funny fantasy ? If so , then he 's working on a different plane than I. This is an excruciating picture , one in which the production design is 90 % of the thing ( and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment ) . Robin Williams and ( most especially ) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies . There 's nothing remotely funny ( satirical or slapstick - wise ) on display here . It is uniformly draggy , ugly , and one of the very worst " big " movies ever made . NO STARS from * * * *
0 If you are planning to rent or buy this movie do n't . It 's the worst thing I have ever seen . I would comment on it more but It has been 10 years since I saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind . Save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away .
0 this is the only movie i have ever walked out on . bad acting-- bad plot-- bad casting-- bad directing-- bad cinematography-- if they had set out to make a bad picture they could n't have done a better job . i hope they are proud of his turkey . i 'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood . do n't waste your time !
0 Bad movie . It´s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown - ups . I just saw it because I´m a Robin Williams fan and I was very disappointed . (
0 The worst movie in the history of cinema . I do n't know if it was trying to be funny or sad , poignant or droll , but the end result was unwatchable . Everyone from Key Grip , to Robin Williams , and back down to Best Boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film !
0 I thought this was a great idea but , boy , was it poorly executed . We do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are , but virtually no specifics about any of it works . The producers do n't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a " through - line . " ( Which is not to say they did n't try , but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the program 's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera.)<br /><br />We see lots of things happening , but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why . There 's little sense of who is who , or how the various production departments fit and work together . For instance , several times we hear about a problem of some sort -- one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and/or how it gets resolved . But instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else ( generally , pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets . ) < br /><br />Overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you 'd see run under the closing credits of a show , rather than anything worth watching for its own merit .
0 I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production . I have to say , I was very disappointed . The subject had so much potential . The sets in a Wagnerian production must , of necessity , be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience . Instead , what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery , vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention . I found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas . I was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production - that did come across fairly well and next time I am at the opera I am sure I will remember that part if this video - but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation .
0 This movie is about a female rape victim / comic book writer from New York that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty , run down small town where she finds refuge in a single - wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere . The townspeople are mentally ill , yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer . Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance . DB Sweeney 's performance was high school at best . He 's one of those kinda - cute young actors with a sweet grin . Unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow . To the previous commentator stating that the acting was " so real " , well I agree . Actually it was n't acting . The two main characters really are pathetic , weak and incapable of making mature , healthy decisions . In brief , this movie sucks like no other , rent it to laugh at it . The real crime scene ? The atrocious Wood paneling in the trailer - enough to make ME commit murder . And lastly , she 's a artist / writer , so could n't she afford a double - wide trailer and something other than a sun - yellow Chevy Chevette for love of god !
0 There is an awful lot wrong with this picture , beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant . Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city . She immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged ( Craig Sheffer ) , and who seems to be attempting a third rate Mickey Rourke imitation . D.B. Sweeny is a local cop , who is supposedly there to protect and serve . Meanwhile , the script manipulates the audience as to who 's really the good guy ? Logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns , and there are more unanswered questions than there should be . If you think " Blue Desert " might be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall , you will be disappointed . His part is insignificant , just like the entire movie . - MERK
0 ' Blue Desert ' may have had the potential to be even a half - way plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character , Lisa Roberts ( Courtney Cox ) not been so stupid . When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York , comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town out West . In her first days there , she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins ( Craig Sheffer , playing this part well ) who will eventually not leave her side . Fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before , she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop , Steve Smith ( D.B. Sweeny , who 's character does not seem convincing enough , leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers ) . Smith needs Roberts cooperation because , as he tells her , Atkins is an ex - con and guilty of sexual assault . But , the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away before.<br /><br />The movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough , there is such confusion as to whom Roberts should trust . However , much of the intended suspense appears too forced because Roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might . And her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly , particularly in the finale . Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role ; too baby faced in ways that kind of recall Kevin Anderson 's persona evident in his character in ' Sleeping With the Enemy . ' Or , if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character , this might suffice as well . In the meantime , the film is not all that great , even as a low - budget B - thriller .
0 for a lot of time I was looking forward to see this movie , here in Latinamerica japanese or any oriental movies have no distribution in theaters , we can find some of those movies in some underground stores , and I just found Avalon , I was expecting something good , but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene , the rest of the movie is boring and senseless , just plain stupid , with a lot of useless scenes , and a boring story . I am wasting my time even writing about this film . Sorry but is the truth .
0 I must say , when I read the storyline on the back of the case , It sounded really interesting , but when I started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end . Some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly .
0 The orange tone to everything was just yucky . Oh yeah , the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange - tinted with orange - tinted people . Meanwhile , to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body , she plays a full - immersion video game ( which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay ) . She apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company ? . Lots of non - speaking pauses later the story drags on slowly . She uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and I can only suspect a Microsoft future release.<br /><br />Meanwhile , I the viewer , ask basically why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life ? Oh yeah , playing games is fun , but what is the point when you 're almost starving ? While she is piddling her life away playing some lousy even - more - orange - tinted lame full - immersion video game her dog runs off ( probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention to it and feeds it regularly ) or is stolen from the woman ( while she is ignoring her lousy orange - tinted reality).<br /><br />Meanwhile she obsesses over some game her game - playing team lost the entire uninteresting movie . Yawn . So she wants to be the best of the best , go get them Ash Catchem ( got to bore us all ) . Golly , this main character sucks as a human being as well and has no redeeming qualities aside from her physical beauty ( which she could barter for some manner to escape her crushing poverty).<br /><br />So she reaches the " Real " level and it , at least , not sucks horribly and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate mentally living in the " Real " level . Finally the sucky boring bland orange - tinted movie is no longer a tedious chore to watch , but has the potential to say something along the lines " the main character is trapped in imaginary computer - generated poverty and she is actually in the real world now " . Perhaps she will do the murder deed and live in the real world now ? Well , she kills the guy and he vanishes in a digital effect . Wow ! Thanks idiotic director . You suck , you suck so very much , director.<br /><br />Here the director had an iota of a chance to redeem himself slightly by burying this lousy lame moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twist.<br /><br />The director could have said , " The REAL WORLD is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to make it better , it wo n't be some cruddy orange - tinted poverty land . " A clever way to make this suck - tacular movie a agonizingly slow lesson on basic civic pride ( for the 1 % of the viewers that have n't found something actually entertaining to watch at this point or are movie - masochists).<br /><br />Nope , director . The director had to screw this all up by tossing in some cruddy digital effect and ruin all chances of redemption for this awfully lousy movie which was a waste of money , a waste of time , and a waste of viewer trust.<br /><br />After that , it ends . Good riddance . I hope the director chokes on it . I 'm putting this HACK on my " avoid at all costs " list for any other films his name is attached to .
0 Even if 99,99 % of people that has seen this movie is Brazilian , I 'll keep up with the English since it is the language of this website.<br /><br />This movie is a piece of cr*p . Worst acting I have seen for a loooong time . The kids are terrible . Specially the boy . This was the first time I saw someone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger , and one single voice tone , like a 5 years - old kid reading in front of the class . How can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie ? The storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better ( she is 3 yrs old ) . It is so simple it could be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes.<br /><br />There are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie : 1 ) you are a pre - teen ; 2 ) you have been so brainwashed by Globo 's stupidities that you think that anything that has the Globo 's seal is awesome ; 3 ) you have a serious brain damage.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs ! A shame to the Brazilian movie scene .
0 After Chaplin made one of his best films : Dough & Dynamite , he made one of his worst : Gentlemen Of Nerve . During this first year in films , Chaplin made about a third of all his films . Many of them were experimental in terms of ad - libbing , editing , gags , location shooting , etc . This one takes place at a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying . Mabel Normand is there with her friend also , and Chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and Mabel 's friends . He then woos Mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior . Lots of slapstick in here , but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching Chaplin develop . The print I saw was badly deteriorated , which may have affected its enjoyment . Charley Chase can be glimpsed . * of 4 stars .
0 1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin . It was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films ! While most of these films were n't particularly good , they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona . However , by this film , the familiar " Little Tramp " character was still in development . Sure Charlie looked the part , but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed . Instead , Chaplin often hit , kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.<br /><br />As for this very slight film , it is interesting to watch for the cast . While they are not familiar today , Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand , Chester Conklin and Mack Swain -- all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films . The problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes , the plot seems very vague and improperly developed . Chester and Mabel got to the race track ( a very common theme in Keystone productions -- it must have been located near a race track ) . Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in . Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie slaps Chester around and steals his girl . In the end , for no apparent reason , the cops take Chester and Mack away -- leaving Charlie with Mabel ( who , oddly , did n't seem put off by Charlie 's boorish behaviors).<br /><br />Unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian , this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin . What he and the other actors actually do on stage , while not unusual for a Keystone film , is n't particularly funny when seen today .
0 Demer Daves , is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and " broken arrow " remains in everybody 's mind . As far as melodrama is concerned , he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli , George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk . The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie . Natalie Wood 's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst 's " imitation of life " ( see Stahl and Sirk),but who could believe she 's a black man 's daughter anyway?Susan Kohner was more credible in " imitation of life")and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they can not do anything with them : the poor officer , and the wealthy good - looking -and mean- sergeant . Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with?France is shown as a land of tolerance , where interracial unions are warmly welcome . At the time(circa 1944 ) it was dubious , it still is for narrow - minded people you can find here there and everywhere .
0 A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows , so I wo n't be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring . The idea behind it was interesting , but it seems to drag so much . I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness . Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work ( such as Humongous ) , but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film . A lot of the time it 's hard to figure out what 's actually happening , and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy , most were hard to even see . If a little more lighting had been used , perhaps it could 've been better.<br /><br />There 's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge , apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow , which is much better . I would recommend that over Scarecrows any day .
0 I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it . Well , I ca n't imagine anyone liking this movie because it 's just bad , bad , bad.<br /><br />It 's obvious that whoever made this movie does n't know a single thing about horror . The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres : action movie ( guns and criminals ) and horror ( living scarecrows ) . When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows , the two genres automatically cancel each other out because , first , they 're criminals and who cares about criminals , and second , because they 're stupid criminals to boot ! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does n't work here . Where 's the horror in that ? I wanted the criminals to die horrible , painful deaths.<br /><br />But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres , which could have been original if handle well , NEVER gels . We 're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows , which are " alive " for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up . Making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible ( TV like ) and , worse offense of all , whole bunches of the dialogue are told on CBs , and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we 're watching some sort of Radio show . This part was really BAD . The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea ! I ca n't tell you how annoying that was.<br /><br />As I 've already mentioned , the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid . For instance , when someone suddenly shows up , gutted and filled with money and straw ( yep , straw ) in his huge open wound , the others ask " What drug is he on ? " after they shoot tons of bullets in him , unable to kill him ( he 's been " zombiefied " by the scarecrows . Do n't ask ... ) . Get a freaking clue , morons . I 've never seen such stupid people in a movie . And then there 's the girl . I wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt . When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow " cross " , she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene ( bad acting ) , even though the criminals could n't have done it . What a dimwit she was ! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick . They 're not scary . Nothing much is explained about them . They 're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie.<br /><br />Mr Wesley , filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop does n't elicit anything but sheer boredom . And that scene with the talking head in the fridge . Thanks for the laughter.<br /><br />All in all , this had to be one of the worst movies I 've seen recently ( and I 've seen a lot of movies these days ! ) Between the equally woeful SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS , I 'd rather watcher SILO KILLER again . Yep , SCARECROWS is that bad .
0 Scarecrows is one of those films that , with a little more acting , a little more direction , and a lot more story logic , would have been quite compelling as a horror entry . As it stands , it is still a creepy film that has solid make - up and gore effects , and a premise that sustains the mood of terror in spite of itself . And hey , there are no teenagers getting killed one by one -- just dumb adults , so that is a refreshing change of pace . And the plot line is amazingly similar to Dead Birds , with a precipitating robbery , an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere , and demonic monsters . But just like Dead Birds , the adults are still witless , they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one , and they ignore the obvious danger.<br /><br />In Scarecrows , though , we never really find out the supernatural why , and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness . And like clowns , scarecrows can be very creepy ; unless they look like Ray Bolger , of course . Escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter , after a robbery netting millions , a para - military bunch is double - crossed by one of their own ; a very nervous guy named Burt . He jumps out of the plane with the big , and heavy , box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground . Being the dumbest of the bunch , he is murdered first . But not before he happens upon the Fowler residence , nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy - looking scarecrows , and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed - wire and lots of warnings to stay away . And the weird weathervane on the roof , with the pitchfork and pterodactyl , should have been a warning sign , too . The inside of the house is also quite foreboding ( to us in the audience , anyway).<br /><br />Annoyingly , we must listen to Burt 's thoughts in voice - over , as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard . The way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants -- with me in them -- flying out the door . Perhaps it 's just me , but I really enjoy watching people 's lips move on screen , even when they are just thinking out loud . It helps to intensify the action , and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice - over is saying . Burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway . Sure why not ? decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them , especially with today 's prices , and the battery ? no problem . Now , I did mention that Burt was the dumbest of the bunch , and here is why ( in addition to the above , of course ) . Wearing night - vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house , he takes them off to drive the truck away , and instead , turns on the headlights to see where he is going . Of course , the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck , and know where he is headed . Brilliant . He deserves to die . Definitely . I am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place , as every scene is brightly lit , from the interior of the plane , to the night - time outside scenery , and the house . The cinematographer was either a. myopic , b. just out of school , or c. dealing with really cheap filmstock.<br /><br />Burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere . Go figure . One very nice touch , and there are , I must admit , a few in the film , is the fact that when he opens the truck 's lid , there is no engine . Creepy , to be sure ( and insert pants comment again here ) . The story logic fails when dead , now - stuffed - like - a - flounder - with - money - and - straw - Burt returns to the house . The rest of the bunch are there , rough him up , then realize that he is indeed dead , and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw . Dead Burt does manage to put up quite a fight , though , and grabs one fellow by the mouth , pushing him through a window , causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene . At this point , you would think they 'd would be racing out of the house and back to the plane -- but noooo , they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money . In fact , the whole Burt is dead episode is treated rather matter - of - factly , although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue , " Burt was walking around dead , for chrissakes!" < br /><br />The stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house , and the crooks blithely go for the bait . Soon , another one of them , Jack , is dispatched , and again the scene is well done and horrific , involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia . Now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem , and one of them needs a hand , literally.<br /><br />When one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and Jack getting scarecrow - ized , he starts screaming , running away like hell , and shooting off his gun in typical para - military fashion . So much for all that training under pressure crap . He meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming , running away like hell , and shooting off his gun , even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him . Again , that script logic thing ... Dead and gutted , Jack returns to the house , and goes after the screamer with the usual results . If you listen to Jack 's demonic growl , by the way , you may notice , depending on your age , that it is the same monster - growling sound heard often in the Lost In Space TV episodes.<br /><br />The last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane , barely escaping . But do they ? You will have to see the film to find out .
0 Falls into the film category of " Way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously " . Whereas Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth or My Boyfriend 's Back know they are bad , Scarecrows does n't . Evil Dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre , that Scarecrows is simply out of place . < br /><br />Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane . The repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc , but nothing comes . Although the men are obviously the scarecrows , there is no explanation.<br /><br />Knowing this film is too serious for it 's own good may produce some grins . I do n't recall if Joe Bob Briggs ever previewed Scarecrows , but I believe that he would n't stoop this low . However , with an IMDb rating of over 6 , there are many people that disagree .
0 I think scarecrows are creepy , so it 's a pity this movie does n't make more of them . < br /><br />A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows . One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows . The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive ( when they move ) . On the positive side , the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows . It is as Alfred Hitchcock says , " A bomb under a table goes off , and that 's surprise . We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off , and that 's suspense . "
0 SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film . A group of thugs pull off a paramilitary - like robbery of the payroll at Camp Pendleton in California . They high - jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to Mexico . Along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows . These are n't just any run - of - the - mill scarecrows ... they can kill . The acting is no better than the horrible dialog . And the attempts at humor are not funny . Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark.<br /><br />The cast includes : Ted Vernon , Michael David Simms , Kristina Sanborn , B.J. Turner , Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian .
0 I had no real expectations going into this movie and I 'm glad . Even if I had expected it to be bad I would have been disappointed.<br /><br />Where to start ? First , I think 15 % of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle - field . I get it . There 's scarecrows . I think the title " Scarecrows " was sufficient.<br /><br />Second , not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences . There 's too many times where I was left going WTF?<br /><br />Third , the movie takes itself seriously . I 'm all for a B - movie with buckets of blood , screaming women , and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse . But those movies often know they 're B - movies and even flaunt it , like Dead Snow ( hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick ) or Evil Dead 2 . But this movie seems oblivious to its crapdom.<br /><br />Finally , there should of been more blood and/or nudity . Yea , I said it . If you 're going to have a crap horror movie , make with the killing . And if you 're going to have one hot and one semi - hot girl , one of them needs to show some side - boob at a minimum.<br /><br />So , like the summary says , skip " Scarecrows " and just poke yourself in the eye . You 'll thank me .
0 I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it . Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film . He failed thank God.<br /><br />The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin wo n't like her because she 's ugly . The film is just bad for so many reasons . The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits : ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit . Those two scenes made me cringe ! Janeane 's character is sickeningly arrogant ( and guessing from her role as stand - up " comedienne " and arch - feminist is in real life too ) . She claims that the film is " anti - feminist " when in fact it 's just realistic . Men more often than not go for looks over personality . It 's interesting to note her hypocrisy too . She 'd been a feminist and " comedienne " for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad . I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film . I mean come on ! She acted in it for Heaven 's sake ! What this film was really was anti - men if anything . It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman 's character Noelle.<br /><br />There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin 's character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure . Is that the best the script writers could come up with ? Blimey they 've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made . There 's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is . The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo is n't ugly but is actually beautiful . Erm was I watching the same film as they were ? She 's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one . Although having said that , I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well : she 's lanky and gaunt looking.<br /><br />I guarantee three things about this film if you 've never watched it:<br /><br />You will know what the ending will be;<br /><br />You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;<br /><br />You will be bored after ten minutes.<br /><br />Watch at your own peril .
0 I liked it but then I think I might have been ironing at the same time . This reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is an utterly undemanding , formulaic romcom rescued from straight - to - video ignominy on its release by the sharp turn of Janeane Garofalo . Playing the Frasier of Pets , she finds herself caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend ( Uma Thurman ) off as herself when a caller comes a - courtin'.<br /><br />This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin . An average British actor , he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this film . He is unremarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is unsurprising on the basis of it , although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both the later Terence Malick films . Uma Thurman does a ditzy turn on autopilot and Michael Lehmann packages it all together competently . Icky phone sex though . 4/10
0 Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film , calling it , among other things , anti - feminist . She has also said on her radio show she hates making " romantic comedies " because she does n't believe in them . I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here . This film is a trifle at best . She does her best , but overall , it was just another boring , unbelievable " romantic comedy " that has no basis in the real world . Whereas there will be some who will say " suspend your disbelief " , one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood . Janeane 's character , for some reason , is usually filmed in shadows and darkness , which makes her look unattractive , while Uma 's character is filmed in lighter tones ( which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film ) . That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two . As many have said here and on other comment threads , Janeane is not ugly , but in fact , quite beautiful . I have n't read one review where someone said Uma was better looking . Having said that though , I believe that Ben Chaplin 's character would more than likely stay with Uma , not Janeane . Many men do n't like really intelligent women ( and many women do n't like really intelligent men ) , and sadly , Ben probably would have stayed with Uma . And despite the director 's attempt to make Janeane unattractive , it does n't work . Her natural beauty comes through anyway.<br /><br />I think a lot of Janeane 's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character , and actually scoring with Janeane . Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here ( real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine ) , so take a cold shower gentlemen . This is the role that Janeane is best known for , and that 's a shame , as this really is n't that good of a film .
0 The message of this movie is " personality is more important than beauty " . Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the " ugly duckling " , but the funny thing is that she 's not at all ugly ( actually she 's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman , the friend who looks like a model).<br /><br />Now , would this movie work if the " ugly duckling " was really unattractive ? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy?<br /><br />In my opinion , despite the message that it wants to convey , this movie is simply ridiculous.<br /><br / >
0 This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters , but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her , riding in a Hollywoodized camel train . Previously , we 've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along , but must rally in the face of attack . I 've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn . However , Bruce Cabot 's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he 's base and unsubtle in comparison , but I 've always felt he 'd just emerged , smiling , from under a car , covered in grease and a sixth grade education . Some people like 'em that way , as did Gene 's gypsy queen character . This is an action adventure filler , tho , and just as we 've been warned of invading locals with guns , ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land , there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all . This feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon , a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better . It was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles . A two or two and a half stars out of five .- MDM
0 This film had no huge stars in it , but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors AND Gene Tierney before she became a big star . With George Sanders , Reginald Gardner , Harry Carey , Bruce Cabot , Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke , you 'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered . Most of this , I suspect , is because of a second - rate script , as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well - established man at the helm.<br /><br />The film is set in East Africa during WWII -- just before the Americans entered the war . The Brits are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals . One of the white men in the film is a double - dealer -- working for the destruction of the British Empire ! But , lovely Tierney , playing a sultan 's daughter ( ! ) , is out to help save the day for good ol' Britain.<br /><br />American film makers have long sided with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro - empire films . Nowadays , with changed sensibilities , the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for Queen and country seems ridiculous -- and it would be hard to root for either side ! Still , in its day , this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the British -- though when seen today , the film suffers from a long - winded script and silly casting . The one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent . Too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk -- losing some of its punch .
0 I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy . Although the movie is family friendly , my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of God . If you obey God and follow Him , you are not guaranteed success . Your football team wo n't always win . You wo n't magically get better grades . Infertility is n't always cured . You wo n't always get a raise . Sometimes , you 'll be stuck with the old car.<br /><br />God does not exist to meet our every whim . Rather , we were created to glorify Him . Sometimes we glorify Him most when things seem to be going bad for us . To live is Christ ; to die is gain .
0 As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie . Then I watched it . The acting was n't the best . That 's forgivable . It 's the message that 's not : Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you 'll tackle better , make amazing catches , stop fumbling , start making touchdown passes , and even make the playoffs . All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All - American athletes . I laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals . But wait , that 's not all . You 'll get a brand new truck , a $ 6000 raise , and you and your wife 's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice . THEN you 'll win the state championship because God helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he 's ever kicked before - and into the wind , no less - all because " God wanted him to make it . " Then you 'll win the state championship again the next year . None of this good stuff would have happened if the team had n't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts.<br /><br />Here 's what I took away from the movie : God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it 's all about making our lives better , easier , and more enjoyable . He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games . Which bible is this story based on ? I 'll bet Saint Stephen wished he 'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death . Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus . It would have saved them all a lot of trouble .
0 I watched this film in youth group , where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it . Then some adult couple at a church - related Christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance , and now my household is stuck with the film ( though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap ) . I cried bitter tears over these sad events , and here 's why : First off : this film has good intentions , especially if you 're a Christian like me . This movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in God and that it 'll make your life better . Not so bad , right ? Eh . It turns out a be a problem -- a big one . This movie was made by a church , so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for Christians as possible . It is all black - and - white , no gray areas . God 's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing , and it comes instantly to all those who do His bidding.<br /><br />This is not the God I know . This is not the Christian life I am familiar with . The God I believe in is a powerful and trustworthy God , but He is not one that grants my every wish . I follow Him as best I can , though the going is often hard ; yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self - control a lot easier than anyone should EVER find it . I can not relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad - side to good - side in the course of a few structured movie scenes . And when I DO follow His commandments as laid out in the Bible , I certainly do n't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do . The largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that I have done the right thing ; everything else comes with long , messy , arduous work.<br /><br />But take the example this movie sets : Grant Taylor coaches the football team at Shiloh Christian school , which has had 6 losing seasons in a row . He may lose his job over it , and he and his wife are low on money as it is . They want a baby , but the doctor tells him he is sterile . Oh , and his car does n't work . And the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents , whiny after their million losses , and bad at kicking field goals . This is sure one rundown community here.<br /><br />But wait , Grant Taylor decides he 's going to trust in God for everything ! And he passes on his faith to his team . So far , so good . Not for long . As they begin to obey , blessing literally POUR in on them . Suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents ; the school has a big " revival " ; the team starts winning EVERY game ; they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league ! Coach Taylor 's job is reassured ; the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present ( which , by the way , is the epitome of shallow , fair - weather employers ) ; he gets a raise ; his wife ( get this ) even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm ! And that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters ! ! Wowzers , woot , yay , praise the Lord , etcetera , etcetera ! ! ! ... < br /><br />Yipe . Just YIPE . Nobody in my church has ever experienced Christ in a such a cut - and - dry manner . Yes , there have been miracles aplenty in my family , as well as gifts and creature comforts , and I attribute them to God 's grace and lovingkindness . But God is n't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad ! He is by and large a mystery ; His gifts come unexpectedly , often when you think you do n't need them but you really do . It 's a long , hard slog to the road of fulfillment , and things NEVER turn out the way you thought they would.<br /><br />This movie has good intentions . But because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism , it tanks tremendously to a 1/10 . The bad acting and sports movie clichés seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes.<br /><br />To all you future churches planning to make a movie : do n't be afraid to show REAL life , even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix . However much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat , nobody has learned anything substantial from it . Give us the meat , the bones , the REAL stuff ! True life applies to everyone , not just Christians , and that 's one aspect " Facing the Giants " did n't manage to grasp .
0 It 's interesting how 90 % of the high - vote reviews are all comprised of " * random username * " from " United States " ( no state pride ? ? ) who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies . I would delve further into this suspicious trend , but alas , this is a review of the movie , and not the reviews themselves.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie fan . This means I have seen a great many movies , from good to bad , and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is , in fact , NOT a good movie . It has good intentions , but fails to meet many ( if any ) basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience.<br /><br />The Acting : Mostly Terrible , Palatable At Best . Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me.<br /><br />The Dialogue : Clumsy , cheesy , the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you 'd see performed in Sunday School or youth group function . The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of " meaningless words " , but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world , and the complete absence of it is palpable . Let 's just say the mean ol' head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than " OH NO ! " when things are not going his way.<br /><br />The Plot : Mind - bogglingly predictable . It has been commented that this movie is " not a Hollywood cliché " , and yet it 's like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies ( including the mandatory quasi - romantic subplot for the ladies ) and just had a Christian - themed coat of paint slapped on it . I 'm not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception . Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here.<br /><br />The Directing / Editing : It , too , was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template . Still , acting aside , there were n't many noticeable goofs , so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent.<br /><br />The Message : Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes . Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team 's eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole " If we lose , we praise You " part , because in the Real World , you WILL fail at one point or another and it 's good to be prepared for that . But in the world of Facing The Giants , if you fail , clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating . Another interesting question being , what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion ? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last - minute saves , or would the universe simply have exploded ? < br /><br />The Bottom Line : For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood , Facing The Giants will be another mediocre - at - best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film - making . For everyone else , the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else . And a warning : Any attempt to show this to non - Christians will lead not to conversion , but to derision . I give this two stars , one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes , and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget .
0 I 've been scolded and scorned by fellow Christians for stating my disappointment with this movie . I get hounded by statements like these : " I ca n't believe you did n't like it ! It was made totally by Christians ! " " Everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie ! It was made by a church and not Hollywood . We should spend our money on movies like this ! They only used $ 100,000 to make the film . " " This is by a real church and Christian school in Georgia ! A preacher wrote and directed it . " So , apparently , the reason I should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by Christians . That is all that is needed for me to love the movie.<br /><br />Look , I got the movie without knowing ANYTHING about the background of the film . I had never heard of it and had no idea - other than football - what it was about . I watched it like I watch any other movie and was disappointed . I was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script . I was VERY disappointed on the resolution after the climax . Do n't worry . There have been other cheap movies and other EXPENSIVELY made movies that have earned less respect from me . It is n't about the making of the movie . It is the end product.<br /><br />The writer acknowledges that God does n't say " yes " to everything we pray for in the way we want , but he wanted to show by having faith , God changes our lives . That is true . However , God can change our lives and we 're still infertile . God can change our lives and we do n't get a raise from our job . God can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy . God can change our lives and our house is still stinky . Why did n't he portray that in the movie ? Others voiced their concern to the writer / director over the matter , but apparently , he was defensive.<br /><br />I did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots . I like the idea of going to God and recognizing His awesome power and our weakness.<br /><br />The writing and directing were very weak . It is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development . All we really get from the coach 's wife is she is not pregnant ( well , until the end of the movie ) . It seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into " I have a cripple father and I ca n't play football well , but I 'll kick the winning field goal even though I 've never kicked a real field goal before . " Another problem was the Christian school itself . Umm , I have worked for two Christian schools , went to one myself , and have had many nieces and nephews in other Christian schools . All in all , I 've had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones . NONE of the problems that I have seen in ALL of these schools were addressed . I saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor . It would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how God can work.<br /><br />I will close by stating that every work - either written or drawn or played on an instrument - shares the artist 's world view . The world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of " People who pray the right way win ball games , get new cars , conceive when they could n't , get a raise , and get their house fixed - all within a short time span . " I know . I should LOVE the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it . I think I should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason .
0 I went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama ( in the same vein as Remember the Titans ) ; however , I came away feeling like I had just attended a Ted Haggard sermon about the Rapture . The only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie . Actually , one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment . At least with the televangelist sermon , there are quotes from the Scripture rather than quotes from popularist self - help pulp . The plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long - enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie .
0 This is n't a film , it 's a 111-minute Evangelical Christian sermon draped over red state America 's # 1 sport , high school football . Another of the long , earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours.<br /><br />Dialogue like " You won the big one when you accepted Christ " loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director / Coach Alex Kendrick 's sunken black eyes . Then there are the " parables".<br /><br />Two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it . Which one do you think God blessed ? This rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax , in the course of which Coach asks his trepidous back - up kicker , " Son , do you think God could help you make that kick ? " It 's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith - based funding ad infinitum , if only the Evangelical Christian Bush Administration 's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become " devout " after their example . Behold that poor Giants coach in the apocalyptic finale , urging his team on crying " Who 's with me ! " while the devout Eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the Lord 's work.<br /><br />So , do you think our terrified back - up makes his kick to vanquish those self - centrist Goliaths ? Well , we all know zealots ca n't lose . Put it this way : Transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the Middle East , replace the Christian proselytizing , and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban - vs - Superpower parable , which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute.<br /><br />Luckily they wo n't care , nor need to : like Coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame , the answers are all right here in this Book . And the Christian Right will devour this on their way to their Rapture , that final victory they have prepared their fields for .
0 Having just watched this movie , I almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life , but I guess there is some good in everything:<br /><br />If I was to rate this as any other movie , it can only receive 1 or 2 tops , but if I grade it like a low budget ind . movie , it may get 3 or 4 . That is a movie is supposed to be ' complete ' and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time . This movie is n't . But I guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills , and considering this , this movie has a few highlights . If I am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project , I guess the distorted sound effects had some quality . They also manage to build some characters , this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project , because the character building takes too long , since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot . Neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project - what s the point ? I guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything ( building characters , suspense and a plot ) , and ends up being nothing ( not a lot)<br /><br />This movie tries too much and too hard , and I guess it should have been cut to a short film . I could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie.<br /><br />There is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie . The story should have been more streamlined . I know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie , but a slight surprise to who the killer is , does n't make a mystery . The story behind the " mystery " receives almost no attention during the film , which leaves the final " point " as a quick an unsatisfying wrap - up . < br /><br />Therefore I would like to say this movie was a nice try , but I ca nt . I hope the directors learn from their mistakes , and produce a better product next time.<br /><br />If you do n't have an interest in bench learning from producing low budget movies , there is no need to watch this - not even too see why everyone thinks its bad.<br /><br />As others have stated I am pretty sure the many 10 's given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie . This movie could not receive a " 10 " judging from any remotely objective standpoint .
0 THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most over - directed , over - the - top , over - everything mess I 've ever seen come out of France . There 's nothing worse than a French production trying to out - do films made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror / action / buddy flick . I almost stopped it halfway through because I knew it would n't amount to anything but French guys trying to show - off.<br /><br />The film starts off promisingly , like some sort of expansive horror film , but it quickly shifts genres , from horror to action to x - files type to buddy flick , that in the end , CR is all of it and also none of it . It 's so full of clichés that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy . The painful dialogue and those silent pauses , with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments , made me groan . I thought only films made in Hollywood used this hackneyed technique.<br /><br />The chase scene , with Vincent Cassel running after the killer , is so over - directed and over - done that it 's almost a thing of beauty . The climax on top of the mountain , with the stupid revelation about the killer(s ) with Cassel and Reno playing " buddies " like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS , completely derailed what little credibility the film had by then.<br /><br />It 's difficult to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA , which though had its share of problems , does n't even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked , confused film .
0 This is a classic example of an increasing problem with films . Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue ? What sense does that make ? This film is n't alone . Most films seem to do this now . For 2 years , I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV , but then I got a new TV & there it is again . BACKGROUND noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue.<br /><br />It was even more distracting in this film because , in the English version anyway , the woman mumbles constantly . I kept hoping Jean Reno would say " Excuse me , would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth . " If you watch it on DVD & you have even high - school French , I recommend the French version with subtitles.<br /><br />I give it 4 because Reno was so good in Leon . People rave about the scenery , but I saw it on a TV & I lived in the Rockies for a few years , so " Enh " .
0 One wonders why this picture was made at all : the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous , the characters ( experienced loner cop versus younger one , quite fascinated ) quite predictable , the ending totally murky and impossible to understand ( maybe after several viewings but you 'd have to have a masochistic tendency for that ; the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it 's all about)and the acting is bad . Was the basic idea to show that French film makers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include " Seven " and " Silence of the lambs " ? If so , it is a total failure . It was quite a success though ( and has a sort of cult - status as the first French serial killer film)and , it seems , considered as a good product to export . Strange .
0 This film was rather a disappointment . After the very slow , very intense ( and quite gory ) beginning the film begins to lose it . Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation , and coming out of the theater I wondered what this was all about . The characters remain shallow , the story is not convincing at all , most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody , and there are some very cheesy parts ... Like , the young cop has to do dig up a body . Of course it 's night AND it rains AND he has to do it alone ... yawn ! Or The Manifestation of the Evil being " nazis " plus " genetic manipulation " ... Wow , that 's really original . There are some nice bits , though , like the fistfight scene , mountain views and some ( running ) gags , but ( though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can ) that 's definitely not worth it . ( 3 out of 10 )
0 Råzone is an awful movie ! It is so simple . It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life . Just like Zappa did many years ago . But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors . Leon are by many still the little girl in " krummernes Jul " , and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role . several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!<br /><br />Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see . I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this , but i think it can show how it can end , if you are letting your child down . Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like " Film folket"!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see Råzone . Not because it is a great film , but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes . I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it , and actually it is in these scenes , Laura is acting best . - like the ending where she is holding the gun !
0 It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore , maybe to the MediocreLand ? " PP " reminds me any one of the many tedious , promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks ( Picket Fences , Ally McBeal , and now Boston Legal ) . The crazy cases they get are so outlandish , they barely evoke sympathy or sadness . And that 's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of , " This could be me " sentiment . They are not funny either.<br /><br />The actors are quite good , but the plot lines are dead and can not be brought back to live . I 'm a therapist , and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent , unethical , untrained therapist . Whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference / counter - transference courses in Stanford . Somebody should give them a Code of Ethics to read ( the episode with the nose - bleeding wife and the therapist 's involvement in it ) . No therapists are that bad.<br /><br />Women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death , we 've all graduated " Sex and the City " . Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age - inappropriate , looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 , and this otherwise talented actress does n't believe it herself and does n't deliver it very well . The only successful / palatable developments are Addison struggling with her decision to move to LA , and the " Voodoo Dr " and his coping with widowhood.<br /><br />This concept might work with a whole new writing team .
0 Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama . So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines . Just by watching House , I " solved " two ( out of nine ) medical mysteries before the doctors did . Boooring . Seriously , if you are a lazy writer , why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap ? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with ... <br /><br />Second biggest complaint : these people are supposed to be forty - somethings , right ? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year - olds ? Is three weeks ( ie . three whole damn episodes ) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend does n't want to be your " friend with benefits " , it 's maybe not because he wants to hurt you , but because he does n't want to risk your friendship ? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you ca n't really buy into the supposed " drama".<br /><br />And I wo n't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone 's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey 's Anatomy ... On a sidenote , do n't you think it 's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete ( sorry , but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart 's Requiem is a loser , PhD or not ) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny , irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle ? Apart from that little fling with Mark , they seemed to be perfect for each other . Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes ' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships , our first choice is often the right one ...
0 I have seen every episode of this spin off . I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey 's Anatomy . Thus i have continued to watch . I 'm afraid the second season lacks the charm , the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it 's predecessor Grey 's Anatomy . The relationships seem contrived and the acting is so - so . The writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA . There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived , unfortunately PP is not so . I loved Kate Walsh 's presence in GA . I 'm afraid Kate Walsh 's life in LA is simply not interesting .
0 I 've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting , considering medical facts that can be learned . But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show 's characters . Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone , even during office hours , which is ridiculously unrealistic . There does n't seem to be one solid , lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all Americans . Indeed , there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it 's truly fulsome.<br /><br />Then we are presented with endless little moral ' dilemmas ' and they 're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who does n't agree with the all - knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice . For instance , in one of the latest episodes we 're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we 're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on . Anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.<br /><br />And I think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro - lifers . Addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds . The general feeling was that if you opposed abortion , you 're a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the US . Two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets , in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression . What 's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in . The script could have been written by Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />All in all , this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far - fetched medical situations throughout the whole show .
0 " Private Practice " is being spun off the fairly successful and well written " Grey 's Anatomy " . The cast is fabulous . The premise might even work . But the writing is just terrible.<br /><br />The pre - pilot disguised as a Grey 's Anatomy episode should have been my first warning . The plot was just blah . I thought maybe it was a fluke . So I set the DVR to tape the pilot and all other episodes.<br /><br />As I was watching the pilot , I just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot . The pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more . There 's supposed to be excitement , flash , great writing , intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season . Amazingly , this show had none of that.<br /><br />Thinking it was a fluke , I just watched the second episode hoping for the best . And although marginally better , it does n't come close to what it needs to be interesting ca n't miss TV.<br /><br />I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch . Not worth the effort IMO , and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season . Pass this one up folks .
0 The complaints are valid , to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women . I am okay with these night time soaps , like Grey 's Anatomy , or Ugly Betty , or West Wing , because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end . However , when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men ( Taye Diggs , Tim Daly , and Chris Lowell ) into sexual tension and romps , and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so - called little hospital , it seems like General Hospital ... or a female counterpart to Baywatch . That was what men wanted and they had it , so if this is what women want so be it , but the idea that this is a high brow show ( or something men will watch ) is unrealistic .
0 I did not think this movie was worth anything bad script , bad acting except for Janine Turner , no fantasy , stupid plot , dumb - ass husband and unfair divorce settings . If you have never seen this movie before do n't even bother it 's not worth it at all . The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner , did a good job acting . Terry 's husband is a stuck up smart - ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off . He think he is so smart but he is really just a nut . Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her . Nice girl huh . Yeah she 's a real peach , not . She 's no day at the beach either .
0 Woman with wig , who " dyes " her hair in the middle of the film ( = takes of wig ) presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away:<br /><br / > * * * begin spoiler alert * * * that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her . * * * end of spoiler alert * * * < br /><br />And what a spoiler that was : the title already gives it away , does n't it ? Bad acting , bad script : waste of time Oh yeah : in the end , she lives happily ever after .... <br /><br />If you liked this movie , you 'll really love " Cannibal women in the Avocado Jungle of Death " ....
0 Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970 's and hated , hated , hated it ! Easily the most booooring movie I have ever seen in my life . Do n't know where Leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate . The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie , just long , long silences with people unable to articulate what they are ( presumably ) feeling . If you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you . If you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster : the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this ! Yes , Leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss .
0 " Nada " was the most inadequate follow - up to " Les NOces Rouges " which , with hindsight , appears now as the last good movie of Chabrol 's golden era ( 1967 - 1973 ) " Nada " is Chabrol 's first real attempt at a wholly political movie;its previous work " les Noces Rouges " had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in French provinces."Nada " includes terrorists , ambassador , hostage - taking , a lot of blood , not really Chabrol 's field . A heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce : only Duchaussoy , who had already played with the director , and Maurice Garrel are up to scratch . Viviane Romance , one of Duvivier 's actresses ( " la Belle Equipe " " Panique " ) , is wasted as a madam ( Gabrielle).Italian actors ( Fabio Testi , Lou Castel)are awful.<br /><br />With " Nada " this a second period of barren inspiration for Chabrol .It would be " Violette Nozières " before he was again at the top of his game .
0 In a time when the constitution and principals the United States were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems , where the Geneva Convention , human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded , a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate . However , if you want to see a film about that , try Ed Zwick 's flawed THE SIEGE instead , because NADA is one of the most infantile ' political ' thrillers ever made . Like Robert Altman 's PRET - A - PORTER , the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of , and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame.<br /><br />His terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes - Fabio Testi dresses as if he were auditioning for MAD Magazine 's ' Spy vs. Spy ' strip , Michel Duchaussoy behaves like an absurd KIDS IN THE HALL send up of the sociology professor from Hell , Mariangela Melato a cardboard middle - class revolutionary wannabe - who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught . The corrupt authorities fare a little better , but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes.<br /><br />It is possible to make a smart film about dumb people ( cf ELECTION ) , but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they 're intellectuals who are talking down to the masses . In truth , were one to recast Testi , Duchaussoy and Melato with Jim Varney , Johnny Knoxville and Shannon Tweed , the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film , not lower it.<br /><br />Chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously , but his staging is so inept ( the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself ) and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch ( special mention must be made here of Duchaussoy : so very good in Chabrol 's QUE LA BETE MUERE , he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it 's back again).<br /><br />Chabrol has made some fine films , but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess - a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this , which would be a great shame . Utter drivel , and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material . One star out of ten - and that 's being very generous .
0 It 's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts . Well , I do n't know anyone involved , and I 've seen the final cut , and it is pure garbage . The only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends ( none on screen for terribly long ) . It 's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd , Tom Savini , David Hess and Michael Berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks . This is an ultra - cheap , shot - on - video wannabe X - Files with terrible acting from a cast of non - actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century . There is little or no action ; it 's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot . Ther computer FX are a joke , but there are n't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a MST3 K way . After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking , you 'll find yourself reaching for the fast - forward button ... and not letting go . Absolutely worthless .
0 I do n't know where to begin . This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties . Sort of like Captain Power or the Power Rangers . It 's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding " secret agencies " and villains.<br /><br />The acting is so bad that it 's not even funny . The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity . It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on , when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car . For some reason , even though the device is clearly stated as being " remote detonated " the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away . This chase carries on . all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts . Standing up on the bikes , doing wheelies and so on . At one point , a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike , we see the bike ( clearly cgi ) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished . Then , a few seconds later the rider and bike return ... apparently unscathed by the crash . At this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it , the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past , then blow up her car . Which was also clearly done with cgi . Sound confusing ? It is , and so is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I might point out that when I say cgi , we are n't talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here . We 're talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type cgi , actually I think it would have been done better on Power Rangers.<br /><br />Why Savini and Todd did this movie I will never know , I can only assume they did for money , as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it ... probably the last one .
0 I am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad . It reminds me of a c - grade porn movie with one major difference : no porn.<br /><br />The story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul . Maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable . At the very least , the pacing should have been picked up.<br /><br />While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had , he should have spent more time on the story or better yet , get someone else to write it . Many of the action scenes were just pointless.<br /><br />It was a complete waste of my time .
0 Now I do n't hate cheap movies . I just do n't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad 's camcorder . If I rent a movie , I want it to be a MOVIE , not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV - Tapes.<br /><br />Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great , and it was n't . Maybe I hate it because it 's cheap , has the dumbest plot EVER , the most unrealistic characters EVER and the really , really , really WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of films EVER . Even Tom Savini ca n't save this.<br /><br />Seriously , this one is a complete waste of time .
0 Absence of a GOOD PLOT , absence of decent ACTING , absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY , absence of decent looking SPECIAL EFFECTS ... need I go on ? Review MAY contain SPOILERS . The actors appear to be READING their lines , and not very well at that . Most of the " actors " were acting like they were in a SECOND GRADE play . The story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders ... it 's not really all that convoluted ... it 's just so SIMPLE and DUMB , that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted . Nope it 's not , it 's EXACTLY as SIMPLE as you think it is . I UNDERSTOOD the " film " , that 's how i KNOW that it STUNK ! MOST of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines ) , TRYING to look sinister . The narrator was ANNOYING . The " special effects " were LAUGHABLE . I love low budget movies . I also like Carolyn Munro , Tom Savini , Jack Scarry , and Michael Berrymore ... just not in THIS movie ... you can tell they were n't getting paid , or were n't getting paid much , because neither their hearts NOR their talents were in it . I LOVE Tony Todd ... however , he was only adequate in this movie . In fact , Tony Todd 's performance is the ONLY reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only in it for a whole TWO MINUTES ( seriously ) ! I would suggest to fast forward the DVD to the two minute Tony Todd segment . If I had gone to the theater , and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this " film " I would have been P.O.'D and demanded my money back . Hopefully the people who made this will do better next time .
0 I had the " privilege " of attending a special screening of ' The Absence of Light ' at a horror convention in Ohio.<br /><br />First off , you know you 're in trouble when the director introduces a film , saying : " Now keep in mind , we did n't have much money ... " Not that no - budget films are bad , but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse , the results are always poor . And there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep - fest . < br /><br />Actually , ' Absence of Light ' marks a first in the world of underground cinema : It 's the only time I 've seen a dream - cast of talented genre vets actually bore me . Charismatic actors like David Hess , Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no - names . Who are their characters ? What are they talking about ? Who cares ? It 's all so dull , you 'll cease to care about anything or anyone.<br /><br />After thirty minutes of this endurance test , I gave up and walked out of the theater . Not surprisingly , so did most of the cast members in attendance . < br /><br />Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this . With a little luck , this movie wo n't ever see the " light " of day .
0 The Honey , I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous . I loved Honey , I shrunk the Kids when I was little . It was an original story and had such an exciting plot ! The sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other 's company . Now Honey , I blew up the kid was pretty stupid , so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved.<br /><br />Basically , Adam is a little more grown up now and the mom 's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children . But when Wayne 's favorite item is threatened for the garbage , he wants to shrink it and keep it , but he and his brother get in the way . But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son , they get caught in the machine as well , leaving the kids in the house alone!<br /><br />The plot is silly , but like I said , it was just a family film that I think some might get a kick out of . The original Honey , I Shrunk the Kids is the best , I think everyone could agree . The third one was n't so bad , I would recommend this one at least over Honey , I Blew Up the Kid movie , it was at least a little more fun.<br /><br />4/10
0 If you liked the first two films , then I 'm sorry to say you 're not going to like this one . This is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video , probably TV made sequel . The still idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski ( Rick Moranis ) is still living with his family and he has his own company , Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue , Wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother . Then he shrinks his wife and sister - in - law too . Now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger . Pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things , e.g. a toy car roller coaster , swimming in dip , etc . Pretty poor !
0 Yes , talk about bad sequels . Rick Moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once - funny - and - entertaining " Honey I Shrunk the Kids " . The concept basically plays the same way as the first film , but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore . If you think this sounds interesting , think again . The movie is boring at best , right down an embarrassment at worst.<br /><br />First of all , the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet . The only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis . The actress playing his wife has changed , the actors playing the kids have changed , the ones playing the neighbors have changed ... you name it . They try to make us believe this is the same family , but the results are puzzling to say the least.<br /><br />Second , the story is a rehash of the first one , with not one bit of originality . All the few jokes ( and there 's barely any ) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from " Honey I Shrunk the Kids".<br /><br />Third problem , the special effects . I 'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget , but they are pathetic , way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series . You 're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area , but you 'll probably end up cringing most of the time.<br /><br />Fourth problem , to locate the action inside the house is just boring . Only few things happen , and when they happen , they are not thrilling at all . The first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature , the grass , and the bugs that live in it . In this one , the adults ( which come up as rather boring , compared to the kids ) deal with dust , a cockroach and a cockroach trap . Disgusting.<br /><br />I do n't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed Disney 's executives , except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new . I 'm warning you : leave this tasteless cash - in garbage where it should stay : getting dust on the shop 's shelves .
0 This straight - to - video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis 's career . As is the Disney tradition , quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash - in ; this is a lazy retread with Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie . Instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer , which did nothing but make me pine for the days of ' The Incredible Shrinking Man ' , when this kind of thing was done properly . Shockingly , this is directed by top cinematographer Dean Cundey , who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time .
0 Inventor Wayne Szalinsky ( Rick Moranis ) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking / expanding machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane ( Eve Gordon ) get ready for a long weekend away from their son Adam ( Bug Hall ) . Wayne 's brother Gordon ( Stuart Pankin ) , his wife Patty ( Robin Bartlett ) , and his kids Jenny ( Allison Mack ) and Mitch ( Jake Richardson ) volunteer to look after Adam while his parents are away , but as luck would have it ( and the title would lead you to expect ) , the grown - ups are accidentally zapped by Wayne 's shrinking ray . As the kids run amok , their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects , wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons , and other threats to them . This was bad , like most straight to video sequels are , Honey , We Shrunk Ourselves was sort of laughable . I had to laugh at that movie " roach " Stuart Pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous , view at own risk !
0 Made one year before ILSA , SHE - WOLF OF THE SS , BLACKSNAKE could have easily been called SUSAN , SHE - WOLF OF THE PLANTATION and it probably inspired the producers behind the Nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical : a gorgeous , horny , head strong ( but stupid ) blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control , whom all hate her and want her dead . Sounds familiar ? Director Russ Meyer and David Friedman , the producer behind the ILSA flicks , are good friends and they started their careers together . So , obviously , there 's a connection there . Looking at BLACKSNAKE , I ca n't help but think that Russ Meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because XXX movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s , and Russ Meyer films , though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence , were never even close to real porn . His films started to look positively quaint next to DEEP THROAT and other hard - core porno blockbusters . Meyer knew he could n't compete with such films and BLACKSNAKE is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career . He obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory . But BLACKSNAKE bombed at the B.O. and Meyer quickly returned to making VIXEN type of films that , even if they still were n't pornographic , they were most definitely more over - the - top than any of his previous films.<br /><br />It 's no wonder BLACKSNAKE was a B.O. failure . It 's just terrible . Trash - o - rama . Jaw - droppingly bad . It 's a quasi - campy take on slavery , if you can imagine that . The end result is jarring . One minute , we 're in typical Meyer territory : exuberant , playful and silly , and then the next minute , super serious meditation on slavery and violence . Huh ? It just does n't work . The slavery / racism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category . But BLACKSNAKE is not as sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS and those kind of films , so I imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it , which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or Russ Meyer fans . Meyer blames the failure of BLACKSNAKE because , and I quote , " It did n't have enough breasts in it . " Well , I 'm sorry Russ , but the film is just bad , breast or no breasts . But he 's right though about the low breast quota . Except for Anouska and the maid , the film 's cast is male . Meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs , in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big David ( Darth Vader ) Prowse . And with Anouska 's right hand man around , who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men , one can only wonder what Meyer was really trying to create here.<br /><br />BLACKSNAKE stars David Warbeck , who is lusted after by Anouska and her right hand man . Poor David . He looks totally befuddled by the whole experience . He did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that , at times , he has no idea what 's going on . And then there 's Anouska Hempel . She 's a beautiful woman ... for the 1970s , not the 1870s . With her makeup and hair , she looks like a typical 1970s Brit pin - up babe than a turn of the century dominatrix . And her wardrobe is hilarious . At one time , she actually unzips her leather boots ! I did n't know they had zippers in those days . But the character she plays is , in itself , really degrading ( no pun intended ) . She 's nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men ( and that woman ) on the island . For example , one night , when David and Anouska are getting it on , her annoying slave driver walks in the room , knocks David unconscious and tries to rape her , groping her savagely . The next day , the slave driver is still working for Anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened . It 's totally ludicrous . Under any circumstance , had her character been a real person , Anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island . Or even killed him . But the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters ' credulity to the max.<br /><br />Ridiculous details like this , and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes BLACKSNAKE a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie . Watchable in the train wreck variety . I just could n't help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all ( the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch ) . So , this being an exploitation film , I guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do . But BLACKSNAKE is mainly for Russ Meyer completists .
0 I had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations . In fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times . Unlike other Meyer films , the sexual antics are down to a minimum . Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive . The plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful.<br /><br />The film is a strange combination of sado - masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts . It 's as though Meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation/ blackploitation by having a higher moral message . Meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit . He then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil . However , because they cancel each other out , you end up with nothing.<br /><br />Because it so bad in so many ways , it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste . Perhaps , because it is so bad , we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable .
0 If you can make it thru " classic Meyer " titles / intro , you can wade thru anything . But would you want to ? I did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into . I suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted ( a la Charlie 's Angels . ) But for my money I 'd like a little something more , more visual , more moving . More . I feel like I 'm begging for gruel @ the foot of the master . the mans got the goods . but he just wo n't share .
0 You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was ( besides the songs ) , well their manager Simon Fuller ( also this band 's manager ) makes the same error putting S Club ( another of my favourite bands ) in their own film . S Club : Tina Barrett , Jon Lee , Bradley Mcintosh , Jo O'Meara , Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens ( what happened to the seventh member , Paul Cattermole ? ) basically ask their boss for a break , they go on , and while there they see themselves on TV ! Three of them swap , and vice versa , half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist , and the other half just get themselves in trouble . Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself . This film may have more of a plot than Spice Girls ' film did , but besides the songs " Bring It All Back " , " Do n't Stop Movin ' " and " Never Had A Dream Come True " this is no goo reason to see this film . Not too long after the band split for good . Adequate !
0 Being S Club Seven , the film already boosts an ecstatic atmosphere ! But seriously , Oprah has a point when claiming : " Do n't go there , girl ! " Spice World suddenly does n't seem to be all that bad ... I take my money elsewhere !
0 Rachel , Jo , Hannah , Tina , Bradley and John are all on top form here . They deserve oscar nominations for their performances . I am a great fan of the tv show aswell . Their music rocks and they 're all so talented ! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM!!!!!!<br /><br />IF YOU'RE AN S CLUB FAN DO NOT READ THIS!!!!!<br /><br />The performances are terribly weak , the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed properly ( i feel sorry for the director ) . The jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little , passionate S Club fans were n't laughing . They thought they could do it better . And they did . They conquered the world . They became S Club Juniors . Paul , " the fat , ugly one who started a mosh band " must be thanking his lucky stars that he left when he did . One of the worst movies ever made . BEWARE OF THIS MOVIE ! DO NOT GO AND SEE IT ! YOU WON'T LAUGH ! YOU WILL CRY ! 0/10 RJT
0 Loaded with fine actors , I expected much more from " Deceiver " than was delivered . The plot is extremely contrived and manipulative . The many flashbacks only add to the confusion . Believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous . I would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid " Deceiver " because you will be very frustrated . Maybe I am just not hip enough to get it , but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending . Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense . - MERK
0 * * * SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I love Tim Roth , I really do , and he does his best with an unbelievable role . I can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script , but it 's convoluted , unlikely and ultimately silly . I saw the fake death ending coming a mile away . Rene Z. tries hard with an underwritten part , and so does Patricia Arquette . The detective whose name I ca n't remember ( the one that 's not Chris Penn ) is a big sweaty over actor . See it if you 're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you ca n't follow it , and so confusing you ca n't understand it . See it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick . See it if you love to watch Tim Roth work with an unwieldy script . See it if it comes on late at night for free . Otherwise , rent The Usual Suspects .
0 OK so i am like most people , give me free tickets and i will go and see most things , now that multiplex cinemas are so good ( i remember the old " flea pit " single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40 ) . In England this film was released as " Liar " , it 's a dog . It is a total waste of good celluloid . 4/10 for the photograpy and set only .
0 Elvis Presley plays a " half - breed " Native American ( " Indian " ) who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons . Everyone likes to get drunk , fight , and make children . Fighting , wrestling , and " punching out " each other replace the stereotypical hand - raised expression " How"?<br /><br />Although he does have make - up on , it 's obvious Elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films ; possibly , he was getting ready for his famous " comeback " . It could n't have been because this movie 's script was anything to get excited about . Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis , and Burgess Meredith in " war paint " , should be ashamed.<br /><br />The best song is " Stay Away " ( actually , " Green Sleeves " with different lyrics ) . The most embarrassing song is Elvis ' love song to the bull " Dominic " . There are some surreal scenes , but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre ; though , " Stay Away , Joe " might provide some laughs if you 're in the right " mood".<br /><br />Otherwise , stay away . < br /><br / > * * Stay Away , Joe ( 1968 ) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley , Burgess Meredith , Joan Blondell
0 There 's so many negative reviews about " Stay away , Joe " in here I just ca n't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen . Here 's a side you have n't heard yet.<br /><br />Elvis Presley 's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason : they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because I do n't have to think when I watch them . That means I do n't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with . I can just kick off my shoes , grab a beer , sit back , switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy - going rock n ' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all.<br /><br />In my books " Stay away , Joe " definitely falls into the " so bad it 's good "- category . Now if you 're like me and appreciate " the trash value " , this is the ultimate 1960 's camp experience . It 's so bad that it 's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it ca n't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways . In the end you 're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just do n't know whether to laugh or cry . In a nutshell : I love it because it 's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this . I still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic .
0 This movie is not very good . In fact , it is the worst Elvis movie I have seen . It has very little plot , mostly partying , beer drinking and fighting . Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted . I do n't know why they did this movie . You could say Elvis was wasted as well , he is much , much better in " Follow That Dream . "
0 It 's been a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy , and I 'd forgotten just how idiotic it is . I 'd place this easily in the lower two or three of Elvis Presley 's very worst movies . Presley plays Joe Whitecloud , a half - breed Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the broken - down shack where his family lives , and where his friends love to party all night long . His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado , and his old Indian grandpa is Thomas Gomez . None of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise . The government has invested in the family 's cattle , but they 're lacking a bull . Elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs , and is pursued by a young boy - crazy gal and her gun - toting mother . This is just a real slapdash of a mess , and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and do n't make this much easier . The one thing that puzzles me , however , is that Elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film . Hard to believe , considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies .
0 After a few lean years , 1968 was a pretty swell time for Elvis : not only did he make that celebrated " Comeback " TV Special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE , LOVE A LITTLE . Therefore , personally I can forgive him for the misstep that was STAY AWAY , JOE which , at best , emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering . Sure , Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are indeed embarrassing  as , respectively , a dopey Indian father to Elvis ' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on Mr. Presley too - but one is glad to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talent like Katy Jurado ( as Meredith 's Mexican wife ) , the two Jones  Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic Chief Thundercloud who is Meredith 's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day ! < br /><br />While there is a surprising ( if not unwelcome given their usual blandness ) lack of songs , there seems to be no shortage of free - for - all parties were the male Indians hit the bottle steadily while Presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs ! As can be expected , the typically ' Western ' Arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy , snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point . On the other hand , the climactic ' destruction of the house ' episode is one we 've seen too often since and does n't work too well here ...
0 A squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy . Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull - riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks ' desert - spread in Arizona , where government suits have just invested in the family 's herd of cattle ( which is in dire need of a stud ) . What director Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills , though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages ( his social commentary is n't exactly pointed , but Tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes ) . Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell , the general wackiness gets way out of hand , and there 's too much hoopin ' and hollerin ' to sustain much interest . As for Elvis , he 's loose and frisky throughout -- and while it 's nice to see him having fun on - screen , one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point . This shambles of a picture has a distinct what - the - hell feel to it , and though spirits are high , the returns are mostly low . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 OK , the portrayal of the stereotyped ' indians ' in this story is just plain WRONG . I do agree that Elvis looks rather good here , but yeah , his skin color does seem to change during the movie . I was thinking , OK, ... he was never THAT tan in real life . It 's some of the most obvious brown ' indian ' makeup that I have ever seen . It 's as bad as the ' indians ' on ' F - Troop ' and the old Hollywood westerns who were played by Jewish and Italian American actors and not real Native Americans!<br /><br />This movie is o.k . , but typically lame story and mediocre songs , like in all of Elvis ' later films . He just did them because Colonel Parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible ! I keep thinking ' thank God ' that Elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out . It is cool to see character actors Joan Blondell , Katy Jurado , L.Q. Jones , Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie , though.<br /><br />Burgess Meredith 's ' indian ' makeup is absolutely AWFUL . It 's The worst of the bunch for sure . What were the filmmakers thinking ? Was Mr. Meredith doing this one just for the money or what ? I do love certain Elvis movies , though . For example : ' Love Me Tender ' , ' Jailhouse Rock ' , ' Viva Las Vegas ' . I can even stand to watch his movie with future TV co - stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner,'Change Of Habit ' in which Elvis plays an inner - city doctor.<br /><br />Oh well , at least Elvis made a FEW good films , but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.<br /><br />I'll always love ELVIS ! Thank you , Thank you very much !
0 Without question , the worst ELVIS film ever made . The movie portrays all Indians as drunk , stupid , and lazy . Watch ELVIS 's skin change color throughout the film .
0 Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made . Well , they are only partly right . For me , this IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD ! I have never seen anything so basely crude , and insulting , and vile , and against human nature as this film . A true embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry , this is n't even so Bad , its good . There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis ' other bad movies like Clambake . This one is so rotten to sit through its painful . Pure Garbage . Native Americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here . Actually , perhaps ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 Stars , seriously . Grade : F
0 As a true Elvis fan , this movie is a total embarrasment and the script is a disaster . The movie opens with the beautiful son " Stay Away " and the scenery of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope of something special . Elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time , especially on the rest of the featured songs . I sat through this movie twice , just to make sure it is a piece of junk ! ! ! 1 out of 10 ! ! !
0 Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt . I 'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers . I 'm not one of them.<br /><br />I've seen better acting in high school plays than I did in Smithereens . The plot such as it is involved young Susan Berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there . She even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the East River played by Brad Rijn.<br /><br />Young Mr. Rijn contributes the worst performance in the film , in fact one of the worst acting jobs I 've seen in a long time . No wonder he 's not gone anywhere.<br /><br />I will say that Seidelman 's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar East Village locations where the film was mostly shot . But her work with her live performers did n't measure up . I 'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with.<br /><br />Look fast and you 'll see a very young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hustler.<br /><br />If you like punk rock , you might sit through this for the soundtrack . I 'll stick to Bing Crosby .
0 A rating of " 1 " does not begin to express how dull , depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is .
0 " Smithereens " is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library . A worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman , the film is fraught with bad acting , bad sound , bad camera work , and poor quality in all aspects of the film . Many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of life 's great mysteries . ( D- )
0 The reviewer from Poland must be a feminist , for she finds " Young Catherine " to be a great film and historically accurate . Nothing could be further from the truth . As a practicing Russian historian for many , many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn , and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single - handed moved Russia into a direction of dominance . The truth ? She was only brought to St . Petersburg to be a wife and mother , and found she had to " bond " with the dvoriane , the boyars , and the military just to survive . So long as she did not challenge them she was able/ permitted to indulge her cultural wishes ( filling up the Hermitage with art treasures , etc . ) . There are so many proofs that she was not " great , " but in this area of post - modern revisionism proof is not very popular . YC is only a costume drama , a bit of fluff from Ted Turner that , like " Peter the Great " in 1986 , is one more example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West .
0 Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie . Vovochka , the main character , is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood . With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way , he finds changing his mischievous ways hard , yet worthy of doing . Personally , I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with , however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen . This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre , that 's the little flavor I meant . All in all , I did not really care for this movie , although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience .
0 I ca n't believe that in the 34 prior comments , nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip - off of Born Yesterday . A man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster . Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after . Gangster is left in the lurch . But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff . Technicolor transfer to DVD is deplorable . Natalie Kalmus would be rolling over in her grave . Check out the paperboy . Recognize him ? But , it 's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock ' n Roll . Also interesting is Ewell 's introduction to CinemaScope , a new format at the time .
0 There are two kinds of 1950s musicals . First you have the glossy MGM productions with big names and great music . And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast , less famous music and second rate directors . ' The Girl Ca n't Help It ' belongs to the latter category . Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well , never mind . Seems like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons . The plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one ca n't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino , Little Richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie . If that music appeals to you this is worth watching . If not , do n't bother .
0 A singularly unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the then - cutting edge rock ' n ' roll explosion with the middle - class sensibilities of a suburban sitcom . The result is a jarringly dated mish - mash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music , but will at least keep their parents sated.<br /><br />A quick glance at the promo write - up on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content . Tom Ewell is a drunken agent , overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow " hi honey , I 'm home ! " The blurb sites him as " So funny in ' The 7 Year Itch ' " . It sounds almost like an excuse . What other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else ? It reads like " So funny in ' The 7 Year Itch ' ... but he 's rubbish in this".<br /><br />Mansfield , a beautiful girl with rumoured 50-inch assets , is , unfortunately , a bargain basement Monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock . Her wooden delivery combined with Ewell 's OTT double - takes make this a comedy partnership from Hell . For her part , the sell gives us : " [ Jayne Mansfield ] whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film 's biggest laughs ! " As you can see , a movie sold on the idea that it 's lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things . Most of this " humour " is men literally falling over themselves , their glasses cracking upon site of Mansfield , etc . Only the Freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its " U " certificate.<br /><br />For the musical side , the most adenine of players are chosen . Would you really care to see Eddie Fontaine offer : " I love your eyes , I love your lips , they taste even better than potato chips " in a song called " Cool It , Baby " ? Only the incendiary Little Richard breaks out of the MOR , though is forced to sing some of his more dad - friendly songs in a four - minute sequence . And how come all the acts sing without a single microphone ? Attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conception.<br /><br />Technically , the picture was quite advanced , with special effects ( including a ghost - like Julie London ) and deluxe color ( Which now looks flat and artificial . In fact , with its reds that bleed and fake - looking flesh tones , it resembles a colorised movie ) . Direction , though , is n't outstanding , and the sound quality is also quite poor.<br /><br />Perhaps it comes down to it being so old . A time when men still smoked on screen , sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance . ( All of which happen here ) . Yet Some Like It Hot , The African Queen , Ben Hur and many , many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today , so the " good at the time " argument does n't really stand up . At its heart The Girl Ca n't Help It is a cynical and patronising venture that does n't bear close inspection . 4/10.<br /><br / >
0 This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line . Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event . There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane . I believe that Mister Bin would play it better . Generally speaking , film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie " Stauffenberg " from 2004 , but ca n't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever . However , movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop - corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast - mood blood and shallow art values .
0 Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time : a she - male villain who looks like it escaped from the WWF , has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects ( the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear ) and takes time out to pet a deer . Then you got the unlikable characters , 30 year old college students , a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots , lots more . Avoid at all costs .
0 Well , I had to be generous and give this a 2 . This was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that lady 's shirt where her breasts are . I found that mildly amusing . Other than that , this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend . Funny if you 're willing to throw " mystery science theatre " comments at it with someone , but it ai n't no better than a 2 . And a 2 pretty much sucks .
0 For the initial 20 minutes or so ( I was watching it on a PS2 so I 've really no idea how long it took ) Alienator sets up an interesting premise . I do n't think I 've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before . However , interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the ' alien ' is a huge body - builder woman in a steel bikini . Yes , Alienator is patently ridiculous.<br /><br />Don't think I hold that against it . In the world of shlock - horror , patently ridiculous can often be a good sign . However , the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it . Alienator is funny as hell , but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order . Actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness , potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set - pieces . By the time the movie 's finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on it.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that the ' Alien ' just kills people by vaporising them , as opposed to doing any ' slashing ' as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot . You 'll laugh at Alienator , but AT it , not with it . If that 's your thing then go ahead and check it out .
0 Throw this lame dog a bone . Sooo bad ... you may watch anyway . Kol(Ross Hagen)is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship commander(Jan - Michael Vincent ) . Kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on Earth . An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive . John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far , far away . Costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence . Vincent surely took the money and ran . Law shows the only sign of effort . So bad it is almost comical . Also in the cast : Dyana Ortelli , P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith .
0 Kol , space prisoner on space death row , manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of America where he , along with some new found friend try to escape from the ' Alienator " a female cyborg killing machine . Made one year after the best movie of Fred Olen Ray 's career , " Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers " , this one ca n't help but feel like a bit of a letdown . Just as low - budget as that earlier film , but not nearly as fun as I had with it . None of the actors really stood out at me . The film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon , but that 's pretty much all it 's good for.<br /><br />My Grade : D+ < br /><br />Where i saw it : Showtime Thriller
0 Music that grinds on the nerves like fingernails on a blackboard , acting that is so zombielike it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie ; casting everyone in it as true zombies --- with the cast of Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as the heroes ... a movie so downright awful that if " stoners " were still around it might be considered a cult movie --- but , oh so amateurish , the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors , their lines read as they slowly shuffled through the movie --- banal , illogical sets modeled after LA subdivisions , props straight from ToysRus ! Was a movie ever made that is so completely and totally inept ? ? ? Logic flies to the wind in this plodding , senseless , pointless and with a " monster " so stupid and uncoordinated that it could n't catch a turtle in an icebox --- lowcut , leggy --- and amazon ! It kept my attention all the way through ; the way a terrible , ongoing chain accident in the fog involving multiple vehicles keeps one watching to the very end ... as , after a ridiculous ray - gun fight in a prison on another planet , a pneumaticaly - disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a retarded extra - terrestrial fugitive --- TO EARTH ! Do n't let anybody p**s on your popcorn , you might actually enjoy watching this one . It 's that bad !
0 Intergalactic criminal Kol ( Ross Hagen ) has been sentenced to death and awaits execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose . But tonight there 's going to be a jailbreak , and Kol flees on a conveniently - placed escape pod and flies towards Earth ( which apparently is nearby ) . There he confronts a group of " teenagers " ( who look thirty ) and a game warden ( John Phillip Law ) , who help protect him from his worst nightmare ... the bounty hunter and executioner android ( or more properly " gynoid " ) the Alienator.<br /><br />From the cover of the box , I was confident this was going to be an awful movie . But , as awful as it turned out to be , it was a ton of fun as well ( probably at least partially because I was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome ) . The director ( Fred Olen Ray ) , who has specialized in making over one hundred low - grade films ( most notably " Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers " ) , does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects . Bonus : P.J. Soles appears ( as " Tara " ) , obviously at a low point in her career.<br /><br />Sure , there 's plot holes . Why are there hillbilly rednecks in California ( allegedly Los Angeles County if I understood the warden correctly ) . What 's up with the space woman 's tacky blouse ? Why is there a subplot about the ship captain forcefully trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere ? What the heck is " Quadrant 5 " ? How does chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will short - circuit an android , yet land mines do virtually nothing ? Why does Kol look like a drunk , Native American football player with emphysema ? And the Lund guy ( Robert Clarke ) ... does his character even have a point ? Does the game he plays with the captain have a point ? Does this movie have a point ? But the biggest mystery is the android ( or gynoid ) the Alienator , played by Teagan Clive . What is an " alienator " ? Why does it look like Daryl Hannah from " Blade Runner " , only much larger ? Because , see , if something is a cyborg , it 's part human . But if it 's an android , it 's all machine . This was an android , so there was no reason to make it look human . It could have looked like anything . Yet , the person who designed her made her the size of a linebacker , with David Bowie 's hair and a leotard that shows me just a little too much . If you 're going to make a female android , would n't the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in ? Mission not accomplished . They say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes , but I think I found a huge exception.<br /><br />If " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " were still around today , this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get harangued.<br /><br />Beyond the butt - nasty Alienator ( sorry , Teagan , female weight lifters are gross ) the film is alright . Maybe there 's not much of a story and maybe the characters are n't really very interesting . And maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason -- what use does a killer robot have with a deer ? But overall , I actually liked the movie . I wo n't be pimping it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest DVD copy ( which I 'm sure is just packed with amazing special features -- not ) . But I consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future .
0 Typically terrible trash from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter(Teagan)commissioned by Warden Jan - Michael Vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict Ross Hagen who has charted course for earth . Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating Richard Wiley who ran over Hagen with his RV on a camping trip gone awry . Soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic Doctor(Robert Quarry of Count Yorga - Vampire fame)proving that no one will stand in it 's way of retrieving the hide of the convict , whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body . Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon , an old Vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin.<br /><br />Perhaps intentionally made awful , this features what fans of " rancid cinema " yearn for .. dreadful special effects , acting , and premise . At least , the film has PJ Soles for some eye candy .. even in ' 89 , she was quite smokin ' . That laser gun sure is funny .. it can incinerate some houses yet when the Cyborg shoots at Law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired .
0 This is almost the worst film you will ever see ! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one , for me . The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as ' cheepnis . ' It looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station , just prior to demolition . The music really sucks . The acting is wooden and ham . The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing . The plot is predictable . It is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films . The quality of direction beggars belief.<br /><br />But you have to see it , if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever . This is a priceless example of a stupid movie !
0 I do n't what that other review was talking about . This definitely is n't a bimbo movie , in fact , I do n't think there was one decent looking girl in it . No , it 's just cheesy , poorly - done , Ed Wood - style science fiction schlock . And it 's bad . I ca n't even begin to tell you how bad it is . I saw it late at night on cable , and I was in shock . The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all . The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded , the special effects are a joke , and the pace is insanely slow . To me though , the music tops it all . A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone . Do not rent this thing , but if you ever see it on cable , watch it . You 'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be .
0 I saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was . I usually enjoy bad movies , but this one was so revolting that it was n't even entertaining . Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie , the hideous special effects ( when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate ) , and the disgusting acting . The acting , in fact , is what I feel steals the show . I did n't recognize any of the actors in the movie , and I hope that I never have to see any of them again . Overall , I recommend renting this movie ( if you can find it ; I ca n't imagine a video store carrying this garbage ) just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash .
0 Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing ! This time , it 's being brought to you by the never - inevitable Fred Olen Ray ! As far as exploitation movies go , this one does n't click ! As science fiction , it 's plain unoriginal ! All that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the Earth , and showing off all that 's nearly bare to resist ! Give me a f --- ing break ! ! ! If this kind of entertainment is your thing , then why not dust off those old SI swimsuit mags from the attic for a change ? ! This would have been much better if it did n't set the sleaze factor on very high , but that still would n't make this one great . I 'd like to point out another film called THE ASSAULT ( 1996 ) by Jim Wynorski , which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR . It illustrates why top - notch 1st - person " femme fatale " action movies do n't translate well in America . Sorry , fellas !
0 What happened ? ' Doubt ' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching . The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep , who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar - nomination . Though it was not one of her best performances , she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.<br /><br />However , not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill . From the boring start , which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending , the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers . It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film , which dragged on for too long , with too much talk and not enough action.<br /><br />Furthermore , the other Oscar - nominations were less than convincing . Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance , it was by no means Oscar - worthy . ( Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith , in Seven Pounds ) . Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination . Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain . It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie , as I am sure she would have walked away victorious . Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance , but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.<br /><br />Overall , I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008 . It was a mess of a film with so much potential , and I do not recommend it . The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep , who though gives a stunning , solid performance - does n't even do enough to save this film . * * * / 10 .
0 OK , I am blessed . I have seen two very strong stage productions , the one in New York with the original cast , and another at the San Diego Rep ( Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney , you rock ! ) . Compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable . I 've been plodding through the DVD for the past two evenings and am still not finished . Way too much extraneous dialog , and waaay too many added scenes and people . Yes , the four major performances are quite good , esp . Ms. Streep 's . But comparing stage to film is definitely an example of " less is more . " The thickening of the play to satisfy film - goers ' need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice . Please , please , please go find a stage production somewhere near you .
0 The Oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep , engaging , powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn Best Picture in the big show . Among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well - acclaimed play . The original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation ; which comes as a double - edged sword . On one hand , who better to translate the play than the original writer ? On the other hand , who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself ? Doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense ; with a frustrating ending , unnecessary dialogue , questionable directing , and of course , the inability to provide substantial answers . It is a growing trend among these " high - caliber " films to not answer all questions it provides , and this has to stop.<br /><br />Doubt is like a joke without its punch line , like a book with the final 20 pages missing , like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game , and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next . Doubt , just like the previous Best Picture frustrationfest No Country For Old Men , does n't really end ; it does n't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending . Yes , that was the intent , but this is n't a test of humanity , it 's a cop - out . I do not pay money to see an unfinished work , I pay money to see a beginning , middle , and end , and pray that I do n't fall asleep during the three acts . We are forced to become the " writers " of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other.<br /><br />This little drama is about a nun ( Meryl Streep ) who seems very sure that the well - beloved priest ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church ; the first African - American boy in the Catholic church . The church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone 's backs . The plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently , which attracts the notice of a young teacher ( Amy Adams ) . The story is set right after the assassination of John F. Kennedy , which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other.<br /><br />Doubt 's strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever - engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over . Streep seems to be Oscar - worthy in every role she 's in , and here she is no different as her sternness and cold - hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church . Hoffman excels yet again as the priest , by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura . The seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off , especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time ; but Hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers . When these two argue , you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched . But let 's not forget Amy Adams ( Enchanted ) and Viola Davis ( Law ad Order ) for their superb job either . Doubt 's casting ensemble is among the best in 2008.<br /><br />Yet , like previously stated it 's the writing and directing that ruins this film , especially when dwindling down the third act . Questions pop up , but they are n't answered . Characters pop up , but provide no real enhancement towards the plot . Kids behave different , but we never truly find out why . There are awkward angles in the camera - work  and  there 's no actual reason why . John Patrick Shanley , the writer of the play , had one previous film in his directing repertoire : Joe Versus the Volcano . Whether sheer arrogance or stupidity , we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation , utter annoying chatter that bores to no end ( There was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted ) thanks to Mr. Shanley.<br /><br />Bottom Line : The lack of an ending is a stupid trend that 's just as irritating as the seizureific camera - work in action films . It does n't matter that we have a great talented acting cast , or decent cinematography , or a good story being worked upon , or good usage of sound and music ; because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet does n't even finish ! The translation from play to film is good and quite accurate , because we have the original madmen behind the projectbut he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well . This decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high - profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end : Sideways , Cast Away , No Country For Old Men , Burn After Reading are a few examples.<br /><br />Newsflash : end your stinkin ' movie . Please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank ( like Wall - E 's depressing backstories ) , instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness , confusion , and mental anguish . Have a beginning , middle , and the end please ! ! As a critic , I prefer my films to be whole , not incomplete . Doubt feels incomplete , which is why it gets an incompetent grade.<br /><br />Someone has to break this stupid trend .
0 I am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say , " The book was better . " I know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it was n't a faithful adaptation . There is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's / editor's / cinematographer's / producer 's control and certainly out of the original author 's control . Therefore , it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same , word for word , as a book or play or video game or Disneyland Ride , or whatever ! A movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society . Moreover , a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and , if it is based on source material , its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers . < br /><br />Films like There Will Be Blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century , Oil ! , it feels relevant because of things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the film 's country of origin , the US , was and is experiencing . Even King Kong , based on the original film , benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have.<br /><br />With that said , I just do n't understand why they even bothered to make this movie ? Besides the great performances , guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanley 's director / writers fee and royalties he will get , this movie seems to come from nowhere . It should have simply stayed as a play . The movie ( which is essentially the same as the play ) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the Catholic church here and abroad . It says nothing new or different than the original play . I ca n't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time : Frost / Nixon , which was also based on a play . Frost / Nixon , while about Nixon 's regrets , seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when President Bush was about to leave office . The regrets that Nixon had , as depicted in the play / movie , about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on Bush and his presidency . In that respect Frost / Nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time . In contrast , Doubt felt like it was yesterday 's news and did n't seem to offer anything that the play did n't offer.<br /><br />Of course the movie is " good , " the performances are outstanding , and the screenplay adaptation is apt , but so what ? Why did n't it just stay as a play ? Why , besides marketing and financial reasons , make it into a movie ? It gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject .
0 I did not really want to watch this one . It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I do n't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker . The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film . I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale . So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle . And to my complete shock , Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero ! He is the one who romances the young Divya ! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too , only in the second part of this idiotic film.<br /><br />Just let me repeat the question : why would a 17 year - old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired , chubby , swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor ? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part ; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself . He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse -- acts like a teenager at his forties . On top of that , just to make himself more pathetic , he plays a pop - star ... <br /><br />To make things clear , I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are . As long as they make a convincing couple , there should be no problem . In fact , leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls ( Amitabh Bachchan - Sridevi , Mithun Chakraborty - Madhuri Dixit , Shahrukh Khan - Deepika , Salman Khan - Sneha Ullal ) and made the pairing pretty well . Also , I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor , I think he is a good actor , and his act in Bobby is still well - engraved in my heart , but it 's not that he looks in this film like , say , Shahrukh Khan , Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today.<br /><br />That was such a disappointment . Oh , and as for the reason every person actually watched this film , Shahrukh Khan made a good debut . He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do . The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well . If you want to watch this film , go for the second half only . Personally , I would not do even that .
0 Dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichés . Man and Woman fall in love and marry , husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune , woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears . The movie is reminiscent of Yash Chopra 's Chandni and countless others . Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances . Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain The music by Nadeem Shravan is superb , all the songs were brilliant . My favourites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye . Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions .
0 I bought this movie because this was Shah rukh khans Debut . And i also liked to see how would he do . I must say he is excellent in his role . Divya Bharathi is superb in this movie . Rishi does a wonderful job . Susham Seth supported well . Alok nath was good in his role . Amrish and Mohnish did their parts well too . Dalip also was good in his small role . Actors shine in a Mediocre movie . The direction is average . The editing is poor . The story is boring . It tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer . He has a lot of female fans . One of them is Kaajal . Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married . Ravi gets killed by his cousins . Kaajal becoems a widow .. To escape from Ravis cousins . They go to Bombay . She comes across Raja . She falls in love with him and gets married . Ravi returns . The story is predictable . The climax is predictable . The first half bores . It also drags a lot . But it is saved by the actors and music . The second half entertains . The music is catchy with some nice songs . The cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative . The song picturisations are dull except for " Sochenge Tumhe Pyar " and one rain song . The costumes are outdated . Any way watch this just for the actors and music Rating-4/10
0 I 'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and just watched this , the episode that started it all , on British Channel 5 . It IS fascinating to think what sprung from this so - so movie and I can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of " Columbo " and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous & classic series . That said , this particular movie is not as good as the rest ( except for the embarrassing final episode & the patronising British episode ) . If Columbo had been made as per the original ' pilot ' it certainly would NOT have gone on for very long , or be watched and loved world - wide . In this film Lt Columbo is smartly dressed , drives a normal car , has a partner , does n't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive . There 's also none of the cat - and - mouse chemistry between Columbo and " the villain " . Watchable , but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo started out .
0 I really like slasher movies , but this one is truly awful . The acting is lame , the script is bad , and the atmosphere is non - existent . The plot is as follows : a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town . That 's right - this is the plot . Very original , eh!"The Night Brings Charlie " is n't even gory enough - if the film ai n't gon na be scary , at least they should make it bloody . Avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs . If you want to see some good slasher flicks check out " Madman","The Burning","The Prowler","Just Before Dawn " or " Humongous"- just do n't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage .
0 I rented this movie because I was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one 's heard of and could be a possible gem . I saw this and , since I 'm a fan of violence and gore , I got it . It got the rating of EM which means : Extremely Mature . Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else , I got it . The warning on the box said : Extreme Violence , Extreme Langauge , and Nudity . The " extreme violence " struck my fancy . The movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick . It had one or two gory scenes but I 've seen worse in a PG-13 movie . Of course the amount of gore in a movie is n't all that counts , right ? You have plot also . Well , the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it . Do n't rent it . I speak the truth . I ca n't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say : " I 'm gon na rent that again . " It had it 's moments where it kept you going but I 'm never going to see that film again .
0 It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there . This is by far not one of the worst out there , still not a good movie , but not the worst nonetheless . Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst . The film has decent camera work and editing , which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films.<br /><br />The film does n't deliver on the on - screen deaths , there 's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck , but all other deaths are hardly interesting . But the lack of on - screen graphic violence does n't mean this is n't a slasher film , just a bad one.<br /><br />The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously . The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle , so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements , done in a tongue in cheek way . For example , after a kill , Charlie goes to the town 's ' welcome ' sign and marks the population down one less . This is something that can only get a laugh.<br /><br />If you 're into slasher films , definitely give this film a watch . It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers , but not by much . The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious . You may forget the movie , you may remember it . I 'll remember it because I love the name .
0 I 'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre , but even by the standards of low - low - budget exploitation , this one is really lame . Even on a nudity - and - gore level , it 's incredibly boring ( there is some of both , but it 's all sort of ... meh ) . Before the home video revolution , it might not even have been released theatrically ( though it might have ; after all , * Plan 9 From Outer Space * played in theaters ) . There is precisely one good ( and competently - delivered ) line in the entire movie ; I assume they stole it from somewhere.<br /><br />The acting is among the worst I have ever seen . I mean , even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors , and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy , which can be fun to watch . Anyway , most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate . Here , those who do n't read their lines like cigar - store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically . And this film does have one distinction : it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie , then laughably overplotted for the ending.<br /><br />(Update : I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception . She is by no means wooden . Not that she 's good , but she certainly is n't wooden.)<br /><br />Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness , but with this one , there does n't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.<br /><br />And you know the funniest thing ? They clearly expected to make a sequel!<br /><br />It 's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way . I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it .
0 A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide . It leaves his family and his best friend ( Keanu Reeves ) asking a lot of questions ... and blaming themselves.<br /><br />Good idea , badly handled . For starters this HAS been done before 1988 - -mostly in TV movies and After School Specials . Aside from some swearing and dialogue ( hence the PG-13 rating ) this added nothing new . The outcome is predictable and Reeve 's attempts at acting were truly painful to watch . He 's good NOW but not in 1988 . Aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy.<br /><br />That aside the movie is dull . I saw every scene coming and every " surprise " was telegraphed . I basically could n't wait for this thing to get over.<br /><br />I have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it ( it bombed BADLY ) . It still looks lousy almost 20 years later . The subject is worth handling but it 's been done better ( with better acting ) in countless other movies . " Ordinary People " comes to mind . You can skip this one .
0 Keanu Reeves stars as a friend of a popular high school student who suddenly commits suicide ... he and his friends go through emotional turmoil and share their reactions to this horrible incident ... Good acting by Reeves and a young Jennifer Rubin .. but on the whole is a little too much .. 4 of 10
0 I picked up this video after reading the text on the box , the story seemed good , and it had Keanu Reeves ! But after 5 minutes of watching , I noticed how horrible his acting was , he walks and talks so stupid the whole time , it 's fake and not convincing . It does n't end there , almost ALL the characters act so badly it 's laughable , the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce ( David ) , but the guy commits suicide early on and you do n't see him again , you never even know why he did it ! Everything about this movie screams low quality , I ca n't believe how such a thing gets released ! I was tempted many times to stop watching , in fact I did , half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off , came to the IMDB to check what other 's thought about it , I found zero comments ( not surprised ) , so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it . The only good thing going ( for me ) was the high - school Rock band theme , the occasional guitar playing and singing parts , but that 's not worth it.<br /><br />Very bad acting and directing ... Terrible movie .
0 I ca n't recommend this film as a date movie . Gary Oldman 's semi - autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent , Beckettian account of one of Dante 's circles of hell , frankly . At the centre of it is Ray Winstone , who has done this sort of character before but never as well . The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that 's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration , self - loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie . It 's an acting masterclass.<br /><br />Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long - suffering wife , who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour . Charlie Creed - Miles does an able turn as the fuse - lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for . Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors , maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor . 4/10
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />Ray ( Ray Winstone ) has a criminal past , has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie ( Kathy Burke ) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat . Meanwhile , her mother Janet ( Laila Morse ) is aware of Ray 's son , Billy ( Charlie Creed - Miles ) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails . The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.<br /><br />It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable , and that would include watching films that entertain them this way . Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this . It 's a tale of a broken family , torn apart by crime , poverty , booze and drugs , the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal . It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men , three generations apart and each copying the other , tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together , despite not being strong enough . If you pick up a little of what it 's about from the off - set , you can see it does n't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly does n't disappoint in this.<br /><br />It 's true what everyone said about the performances , and the lead stars , Winstone and Burke , do deliver some great acting . We see Winstone lose it with his wife , beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia , breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid . Likewise , in a private moment , we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase , the full impact of the night before kicking in.<br /><br />This is another of those films where there 's no ' plot ' to follow , as such , just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next . It 's been acclaimed by many ( including the Baftas ! ) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me . I have no right to criticize it for this , knowing what I knew about it from the off - set , but sadly this is how I found it . * *
0 I 'm not usually one to slate a film . I try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones , but in this case , there are almost no good points . In my opinion , if you 're going to make something that bad , why bother ? Part of the film is take up with shots of Anne 's face while she breaths deeply , and violin music plays in the background . the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting . Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless . Jennifer Higham plays Anne 's younger sister with modern mannerisms . Anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing , which is fine at the beginning , but she stays the same all through the film , and you see no reason for captain Wentworth to fall in love with her . Overall the production lacks any sense of period , with too many mistakes to be overlooked , such as running out of the concert , kissing in the street , running about in the streets with no hat on ( why was this scene in the film at all ? the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written . ) . To sum it up , a terrible film , very disappointing .
0 I love Jane Austen 's stories . I 've only read two of them ( P&P and S&S ) , but after having seen this adaption , I 'm reaching for " Persuasion " from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story , and also , because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense . For me , I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel , you ca n't really go wrong . It will turn out great pretty much by default . I was wrong.<br /><br />First of all , where are the characters that you sympathise with and like ? You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them , and this did not deliver . Sure , I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together , but only because that 's what you know the purpose of the story is , them getting together . Instead , I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the end.<br /><br />Anne was utterly annoying throughout , and in the end , I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her , as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to . She was meek , bland , dull , socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else 's instructions rather than having a mind of her own . This can still work for a lead character , if you do it well . This was n't done well.<br /><br />The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism , of which Mary was the worst , with a full - blown narcissistic personality disorder . Where Mrs. Bennet in P&P had similar flaws , she was still endearing , whereas Mary was more of a freak - show . More loathsome than funny.<br /><br />Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy . For the most part of the story , I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he 's in love with Anne , as surely , he 's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more ... alive ? Acting - wise , not too much to say , as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good / bad the people acting were . Anthony Head was excellent , but as soon as I saw he was in it , I expected no less.<br /><br />Also found the story very confusing . It was n't until the end of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Anne 's stepmother , but in fact a sister ( I 'm still not 100 % on that ) . The whole Anne / Wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy . They had been together but then broke up and they 're both bitter about it ? How come ? I was wondering this for quite some time , and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone ? But it was said in a kind of " by the by " way that it was almost missed , as if it was somehow unimportant . How can it be unimportant when it 's the very core of the story ? ? There was also a lot of name - dropping , but no real feel for who the characters were . This Louisa person for instance , who was she ? A friend ? Family ? What ? It was n't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another . Lady Russell was there a lot , but why ? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister , which felt very unrealistic as Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be his mother.<br /><br />The final kiss , yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street , but I did n't really think about it , because I was too busy yelling " GET ON WITH IT ALREADY ! ! " at the TV , because Anne 's lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met Wentworth 's . Have SOME hesitation there , but only for a couple of seconds or so , not half a minute.<br /><br />Then there 's the issue of camera work . As a regular movie watcher , you do n't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it . I did n't decide to do so here , but I still noticed them . To me , that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job . A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups , something that should only be used when there 's a really important point to be made . In this adaption , it was over - used and therefore lacked meaning . The hand - held feeling on occasion also did n't really work in a period drama . The camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary . ( Not to mention the running itself . ) This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITV 's Austen season . Makes me wonder if it 's worth watching " Northanger Abbey " and " Mansfield Park " or if I should just read the books and leave it at that . I 'm sad to say , this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy . Maybe I 'll watch the 1995 version instead . The BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before , after all .
0 My God , was this the " Run , Lola , Run " adaptation of Persuasion ? It was horrible . Bad enough that the " screenwriter " ( and I use the term very loosely ) cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another , often completely out of context and to rush the story along : but Anne Elliott running from location to location in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination ! Austen must be spinning in her grave . No respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion . And the actress that played Mary ? Horrors . Needless to say , if the rest of the Austen remakes are this bad , they will be turning off a new generation of watchers.<br /><br />If you want to see an impeccable version of this ( otherwise ) wonderful novel , get the 1995 Roger Michell directed version starring Amanda Root ( whose expressions alone can speak volumes ) and Ciaran Hinds . It is superb .
0 I have no idea why they made this version of " Persuasion " when they already had that fine mini - series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds . I suppose that they wanted to make a feature - length version , but of course a lot had to be deleted ; alas , what ended up on the cutting - room floor was all the lovely wit and humour , leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.<br /><br />Also , the characters were shallow and uninteresting . They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent ( and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this , let me tell you : running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool ) . That is something a well - bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done , and certainly not this level - headed heroine.<br /><br />Some have said they found this antic laughable ; my reaction was not laughter , but outrage . The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt.<br /><br />It was ghastly .
0 I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon . UK just so I could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the U.S. I really should have saved my money . What is with Anne running after Wentworth ? The whole point of Anne Elliot 's character is that she was quiet and refined . She is not impulsive and vulgar . And Mary , was she suffering from a stroke or something ? Her speech was n't normal , nor was her walking normal . There was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole " romance " completely unbelievable . In the final scene they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene . The same clothes do not make it the same movie . In my opinion they did n't watch the 1995 version , which even though it had it 's flaws , it did stay pretty close to the book . The book , I do n't even think they read it . This is kind of like a Cliff 's Notes movie of Persuasion . Hit on all the high points without explaining anything .
0 Somewhere , on this site , someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen , one should simply read them . I agree with that . However , we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers ' strike brings to mind that without good writers , it 's hard for actors to bring their roles to life . The current version of Jane Austen 's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do n't have a good foundation in a well - written adaptation . This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds , which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters ( with the exception of the bizarre parade & kissing in the street scene in Bath ) . The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems angst - ridden . The other characters were not very developed which is a crime , considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements . The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about , and Mrs. Smith , Anne 's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in Bath - - twittering away , as many of the characters seemed to do . The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth , which caused Anne to love him in the first place , did n't seem to be written into the Rupert Penry - Jones ' Wentworth . Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look , than P - J was able to do with his poses . All in all , the 2007 version was a disappointment . It seemed to reduce the novel into a hand- wringing , costumed melodrama of debatable worth . If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen 's work , they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare : adapt it to the present . At least " Bride & Prejudice " was taken out of the historical & locational settings and was fun to watch , as was " Clueless " . This was n't PERSUASION , but they did n't know what else to call it .
0 This production never really got off the ground for me . The plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you 've read the novel or seen a better adaptation ( like the 1995 one with Amanda Root ) you 're going to be a bit lost since there 's no time for character development.<br /><br />I liked Sally Hawkins as Anne , but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been . Mrs. Croft was far too old , as was Anne 's elder sister Elizabeth . Mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost . Much better was Sophie Thompson 's Mary , whose selfishness and sense of ill - usage is so well established that by the time Wentworth suggests Anne stay with the injured Louisa and Mary objects that she , as Louisa 's sister in law , should stay instead , you ca n't imagine anyone less suited to do so . In this version , she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production.<br /><br />Rupert Penry - Jones is nice to look at , but he made a much better St. John Rivers ( 1995 Jane Eyre ) , probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling . I agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene : seemed more like he was trying to get rid of Anne than do her a favor . Likewise the accident scene : it happens so fast and with so little context , you wonder what all the fuss is about . And moving the speech that Wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script . < br /><br />My other problem with this version was the lighting . Sometimes everything looked like a scene from the CSI morgue -- very very blue . Other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well , like when Anne visits her old school friend , Mrs. Smith ( who , by the way , is supposed to be more or less paralyzed . Having her run up to Anne on the street to tell her of Mr. Elliot 's awful character was such a violation that for a minute I could n't think who she was -- I thought she was one of the Musgrove girls . And she might as well have been . All the girls were pretty much interchangeable ) . And the running scene at the end ... in an era where propriety was at a premium , it 's hard to imagine gentle Anne tearing all over Bath like some demented hoyden . How silly can you get ? It 's too bad . Sally Hawkins had all the makings of a good Anne Elliot , but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over - truncated production .
0 I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas . Having reserved a special slot for it last night , I sat down to watch it with my daughter ( aged 17 and a Film Studies student ) , with chocolates of course , in eager anticipation . We love Jane Austin.<br /><br />After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk . The shaky camera shots and angles , general poor cinematography , direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied . Despondent , we viewed on.<br /><br />Anne , played by Sally Hawkins , looked oddly and with no particular purpose , directly at the camera on several occasions , breaking our hard - won ' fantasy of the moment ' and engaging us directly in an almost ' I 'll find you ' stalking fashion.<br /><br />Poor Rupert Penry - Jones , who played Captain Wentworth , did his best with the script and direction , bless him . I hope they paid him well , however , as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall , drenching him and his co - actor . They were nearly swept out to sea . Health and Safety would have had a field day ! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line . Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re - shoot of this scene . Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.<br /><br />Other than Mr. Penry - Jones , Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head 's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.<br /><br />Towards the long - awaited end of the film , Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie . It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being . In contrast , Anne ran , hyper - ventilating , from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who , in the meantime , had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told , in the course of only three or four minutes , without even having worked up a sweat.<br /><br />We experienced none of Anne 's charms crossing the screen . Indeed , we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain , spineless , opinion - less Anne and why someone , anyone , did not tell mean , winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.<br /><br />The crucial kiss , normally our favourite girlie moment , was painfully drawn out . As they moved in closer , Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met . Eww ! < br /><br />The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.<br /><br />What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story , filmed in some of England 's finest scenery.<br /><br />Sorry Jane .
0 I have to confess that I am severely disappointed.<br /><br />This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995 . The reason why I watched it was that I was n't entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry - Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book . And he was too.<br /><br />Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film . The rest is as un - Austen - like as possible.<br /><br />Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this . It was n't in her character and it just was n't done by a lady of the those times . The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity . There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst.<br /><br />Although there are 3 important quotes from the book , they are at entirely inappropriate moments , warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed.<br /><br />And although this version is not much shorter than the other one , it feels like everything is rushed . Very little care was taken to introduce the characters , show their dispositions and motives . Important scenes were omitted . How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ? A disaster ! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one.<br /><br />No , no , no . If you love Austen , then do n't waste your time with this .
0 The humor in Who 's Your Daddy is such poor taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes . Close ups of semen are not funny ! Nobody thinks they are . People get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness , they laugh . Watching Who 's Your Daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling .
0 Chris , an adopted son of a moral family , a loser whom works at the school newspaper with Kate ( Christine Lakin from of the awful sugary " Step by Step " show of the now thankfully defunct ABC 's TGIF line - up ) , finds out that he 's just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents . He loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense . He also has to contend with an Uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer ( arn't they are ? ) A slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies ( the opening alone is HIGHLY American Pie - esquire ) , bops you on the head with the moral every chance it gets , and wastes the only star talent it has ( Wayne Newton , Lin Shaye , and if i 'm really stretching the star word , Martin Starr of " Freaks and Geeks " , and Justin Berfield of " Malcolm in the Middle " ) . It 's not bad exactly , but it 's far from good.<br /><br />Eye Candy : a few extras get topless < br /><br />My Grade : C- < br /><br />Where I saw it : Starz on Demand ( available until September 29th )
0 My friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end . It was just so boring and unoriginal . Not even the " hot " girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching . Everything was just predicable and annoying.<br /><br />The acting was at times good ..... but more times bad . The most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend . The more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen . ( you know what fat ugly kid I 'm talking about)<br /><br />The plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies . OK , it is a good idea but that s all this movie had.<br /><br />Overall this movie can only be watched if by your self , to save any abuse from your friends . Or , if you have absolutely nothing better to do .
0 When a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie . I rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie . We could n't have chosen a worse movie.<br /><br />The movie may have been alright with a few changes . First off , the comedy was painful . Physical gags were poorly performed and placed . The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves , bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love . If he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable . There were some funny jokes , I believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parent 's porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn . But to best sum up the comedy I will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid . He wears a puke stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done.<br /><br />To finish off , the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid , cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickering.<br /><br />OH , BTW , there are two good elements that the movie possesses . Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or under - appreciated . The other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry . Her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shame.<br /><br />Don't waste your time even renting this one . It did n't appeal to me and I was part of the target audience ( 18 male ) .
0 I caught this on Showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful . WHO 'S YOUR DADDY ? stars Brandon Davis as an adopted high school senior Chris Hughes , a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents . Though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun , it is ruined by inept directing from first - time director Andy Fickman , a clichéd and predictable screenplay , and acting that is even bad by direct - to - video standards . Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend . Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud . 1/10
0 No , this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach , fairy godmother and the glass slippers , but if I were to elaborate , I would have to spoil it for you , which I wo n't . But do n't let curiosity get the better of you , as this movie is not fantastic . It 's one of those movies that start off promisingly , before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline . And that 's real horror.<br /><br />Yoon - hee ( To Ji - Won ) and Hyun - soo ( Shin Se - kyeong ) are your ideal mother and daughter . One 's a successful plastic surgeon , while the other your dutiful , obedient , and beautiful teenage daughter . Their relationship is like hand in glove , so close you 'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent - child . But things start to go wrong ( do n't they always ) when Hyun - soo 's friends , whom Yoon - hee has operated on , start to go berserk.<br /><br />Perhaps it 's a warning to audiences , and for those Koreans ladies who do n't bat an eyelid when going under the knife , if news reports are to be believed . The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery , though somehow , I thought Kim Ki - duk 's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself.<br /><br />It 's a tale of two halves , the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics , which , I admit , did get to me now and then . However , the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo - jumbo melodramatics , and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat . Some things begin not to make sense , and while attempts are always presented to explain , you probably wo n't buy it , not that horror movies are logical to begin with.<br /><br />The leads are all beautiful , and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role . But hey , I 'm not complaining , though the storyline could have been improved tremendously . I 'd recommend you to watch this , only if you 're a fan of mediocre Korean horror , on VCD . Watch out for those face off - ish moments !
0 Disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in New Mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons . The town of Weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes . The Henleys watch a Blair - Witch - Project - esquire video diary left by the town 's last victim , which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie . Although Hamlin and Dey 's performances are much better than the supporting casts ' , their emotional affect seems " flat " to me throughout the movie . < br /><br />Disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction . However , the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense . Worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie , which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable . It appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes , that they threw away all the elements of good story making : plot development , gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution / outcome . < br /><br />The most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three - quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we did n't deserve an explanation : < br /><br />What was the significance of the Indian symbols on the walls ? What happened to the original people of Weaver ? What was the connection with the people at the dinner ? What did the Sheriff know ? What did the missing boy discover if anything?<br /><br />This was , I believe , a bad move , since it engendered some resentment . I had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events , only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things . These are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week , but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand - alone movie .
0 If you like movies about creepy towns , hotels , houses , states ( ala the Eagles " Hotel California " ) , etc . that possess the people that are " just passing through , " read almost any Stephen King novel instead . If you like the setting of " Disappearance " start by reading King 's " Desperation " but also check out " The Shining " , " Salem 's Lot " and " Needful Things." < br /><br />The crow motif , the desert , the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired . Why did n't they just make the film from the " Desperation " novel ? Maybe they approached King and he nixed ? Must be.<br /><br />Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years , but they 're still TV and direct - to - DVD caliber actors .
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline . But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed . This gullible family ends up driving through this " deserted " town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear , the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them . Their are more gaps than I can count and they do n't explain anything that happens how or what . It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something ( which is never explained ) . The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused .
0 This is waaaaay to much .. so frustrating to watch .. I was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some ANSWERS ! ! .. and what I 've had in the end was nothing but a HUUUGE neon - sign question mark above my head ! ! ! ! ! I have n't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time .. and what 's bothering me is .. how come someone ( an actor ) read the script of such a bull!?#@ movie and say : OK , I'M IN ! ! ! LET 'S FILM THIS ! This is horrible ! ! ! THIS MOVIE SUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS ! ! ! ! ! ! I just ca n't believe I 've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this ! ! !
0 A bickering , American family , vacationing in the west , discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert . Little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs , and a deadly presence is stalking them . I generally love mystery - horror films like this . " Cube " , Spielberg 's " Duel " and " The Birds " are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more . Apparently , " Disappearance " writer / director Walter Klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film , and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer . I personally think he got about half way there , then the film just sunk.<br /><br />The actors are all kind of just " ho - hum " . Their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways . Is anyone else absolutely SICK of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds ? ! ? ! ? At least give them SOME kind of justification for doing so!?!?!?<br /><br />As far as made - for - TV films go it 's an above average fair for sure . Director Klenhard Should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking . There 's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see . I wonder if that was real  < br /><br />No gore to speak of , and the ' creatures '  or what ever the hell it is that 's after these people  are never shown , not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are ( Mutants , aliens , ghosts or ancient evil Indian spirits  Oh , that really narrows it down for us ! ) or where the come from . < br /><br />There are lots of clichés here , too . Why is it that towns - folk in these kinds of films are always really , really dumb ? Why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct ? Why ? Why ? Why ? How 'bout a NEW scenario , folks ! < br /><br />"Disappearance " tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways it 's too familiar to us fans of direct - to - video horror fodder . Hey , I 've seen much worse films , and disappearance ai n't bad , it 's just too   Average.<br /><br />4/10 .
0 What starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing . Do n't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors , there is no ending . No explanation , no resolution , zip . This could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script .
0 This movie was lame , lame , lame . What a build up ! What a let down . All form , no substance . A terrible waste of talent and time . Would not recommend it to my husband 's dog , who will watch anything .
0 The ending of this movie made absolutely NO SENSE . What a waste of 2 perfectly good hours . If you can explain it to me ... PLEASE DO . I do n't usually consider myself unable to " get " a movie , but this was a classic example for me , so either I 'm slower than I think , or this was a REALLY bad movie .
0 The progression of the plot is enough to " rope one in " and create curiosity about the outcome . However , ultimately , the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it . If the intention was to create a perpetual circle ( occasionally done in the Twilight Zone ) , it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort .
0 In the beginning and throughout the movie , it was great . It was suspenseful and thrilling . Yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened . They mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow ? It did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore , was not as good a movie as I thought that it was going to be .
0 This movie tries to hard to be something that it 's not .... a good movie . It wants you to be fooled from begining to end , But fails . From when it starts to get interesting it falls apart and you 're just hoping the ending gives you some clue of just what is going on but it didn't.<br /><br / >
0 Disappearance is set in the Mojave desert as Jim ( Harry Hamlin ) & Patty Henley ( Susan Dey ) plus their two kids Katie ( Basia A'Hern ) & Matt ( Jeremey Lelliott ) along with Ethan ( Jamie Croft ) a friend of the family are travelling along , they stop at a roadside diner & ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called Weaver . No - one claims to have heard of it but it 's definitely there & the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out & take some pictures . Once at the town they take some pictures & have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car wo n't start & they have to spend the night there . While looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared , the next morning & their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn . What is Weaver 's secret ? Will the Henley 's ever leave there alive ... <br /><br />Written , co - executive produced & directed by Walter Klenhard I have to say that Disappearance is one of the most frustrating films I have ever watched . For the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller & horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history . The script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms & I was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on , from the families car mysterious disappearing , the four recent graves , the thing in the abandoned mines , the supernatural sandstorm , the sudden & unexplained disappearance of Ethan & his just as unexplained reappearance , the Sheriff 's sinister motives , the compass in the car going crazy , the crashed plane , the townspeople denying Weaver existed & the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near Weaver in the 40 's but they are all tossed out of the window & for all we know could have been totally separate random events . Everything was coming along nicely & was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming & instead I was treated to the most ambiguous , strange , surreal & downright frustrating ending possible . If nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before & leaves the viewer with more questions than answers . It 's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then did n't know what to do with them & just made the ending up on the spot . I just felt I put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward & in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute!<br /><br />Director Klenhard does a reasonable job here , the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere & the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation . It 's well made but what were they thinking with that ending ? Nothing fits , nothing makes sense & it 's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour & a half leaves you confused & wanting to know more . Despite being a horror film there 's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here & there . The film actually reminds of The Hills Have Eyes ( 2006 ) remake for large parts as that is what the film is set - up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film.<br /><br />Technically the film is good with high production values , good special effects , sets , locations & cinematography . Set in America but filmed in South Australia . The acting is fine from a decent cast.<br /><br />Disappearance is a really odd film , for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens & the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers . I really ca n't see anyone making head nor tail of this , I really ca n't .
0 This is hands down the worst movie I can ever remember watching . Everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded . The acting was horrible too . The camera work was n't bad but that still could n't redeem it . The writer / director of this film must suffer from down 's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career . I want the hour and a half of my life back that I wasted watching this crap . I would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this . I ca nt believe IMDb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but I feel that this movie is so bad that I must continue to warn others about it . The reason I came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the Kris Kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled " Disappearances " . I do n't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my DVD player but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time , pain and suffering . In conclusion , the director / writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street .
0 We had to go to an appointment , so we turned on the DVR to record the ending . After it was over , I looked at my husband and said , " Do you have a clue ? " . He shook his head no . I said , " So you made me watch the end of this movie and I have no clue what just happened " . He did n't " make " me , but you know.<br /><br />The movie body itself was quite good . There was a lot of suspense . It kept you wondering . Then came the ending . The ending was ... well it just ENDED . You were n't let in on what happened or why . Right up until the credits I kept thinking something would happen to explain it , but it never did . So I came here expecting someone figured it out and I just was n't paying attention . Nope . Here four years later , I 'm just as clueless as tom sawyer was.<br /><br />I still have no clue what went on . I 'm just glad I did n't waste any $ $ to buy it because I sure would have been mad.<br /><br />OHHHHH ! I get it ! The end of the movie is what disappeared ! ROFL
0 I 've read some of the other comments and I do have to agree with the ones that did n't get the ending . I thought it was going rather well .. until the end . It kept your mind running and then splat . I have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess . It 's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised . First they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about Area 51 ( which makes you think about aliens ) then after they it went to crap . I thought the actors and actresses did fine it 's just the script went sour . Anyways , if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end .
0 Normally , I have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened , when it 's done on purpose ... <br /><br />But this movie really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes done , then realized they had $ 5 left to finish on ... <br /><br />I saw it on TBS ... I recommend you not spend money on it either . If you catch it on TV , watch all but the last 15 minutes , then walk away and make your own ending in your mind.<br /><br />Really , the movie would have been better if they had simply got away , and come back with the State Poice of Feds only to find that the town and the car graveyard was gone , and by all appearances had never been there ... <br /><br />"Wish I had more thumbs , so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down ! "
0 After I got done watching this movie I was so upset that I had wasted 2 hours of my life . That 's 2 hours I 'll never get back . Ugh . When you start this you might think " Wow this is really good ! " But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING . I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending I have ever seen . This movie is simply pathetic . The acting is bland , the story line is anything but original and there 's nothing especially unique about this except that it 's the WORST MOVIE EVER ! ! ! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! WARNING ! ! DUMBEST MOVIE EVER YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS ! ! ! 1/10
0 Well , i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks . It is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family , then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie , and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees , etc etc etc ..... They go to that town which no one know it exists ( blah blah blah ) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you do n't understand what is THAT MOVIE!!!!I have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst , Honestly it does n't have a description at all and i wish i did n't see it .
0 For a made - for - TV " horror " movie the movie started off very interesting . I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film . But the ending was a total dissappointment . The movie was going along fast - paced and was building up to , it seemed like anyway , to a very climatic end . But guess what there is no end . The movie is just over and after almost one - and - a - half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened . Why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered . There was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot . This film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it . Very dissappointed . This film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film . A real BOMB !
0 The movie starts out fine . Widower out with new girlfriend and the children.<br /><br />The movie is filled with stupid director 's choices . Like " lets separate . " " I am coming down to .... " do what ? Stupid Stupid Stupid.<br /><br />Please do not waste your time hoping that it will get better .............. Not hardly .
0 Visually speaking , this film is stunning . It has some delightful black comedic moments . But on the whole , the plot is very clichéd , as is its seeming message . If you 're a fan of over - the - top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw , you 'll love it . If you 're looking for something at all high - brow , steer away . I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06 , and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing . Ultimately , it is n't disturbing . Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through . If you genuinely want to be challenged , go see something like The Lost . If you want to be grossed out , or tell your friends about a really messed up film , then this is for you .
0 ( Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />I've enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently ; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar , and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro , whose superb " Devil 's Backbone " , set in Civil War Spain , was the finest horror film of the last decade . It 's no surprise , then , that this film is both well - made , well - acted , and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere . But it 's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />What actually is the purpose of all this ? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree , despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice - over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal . In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence , set more than a decade earlier , we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control - freakery ( "  if I ca n't have you nobody can  . " ) . Oddly enough , that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film , but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree , which appears completely different in both motivation and execution . What happened to him in jail to cause this change ? We have no idea , though we do later discover , as an absurd sort of afterthought , that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />In Britain , in several of our notorious " serial killer " or " sex killer " cases , the terrible question arises ; what about the wife ? Did she know , or suspect what was going on ? This is a question that this film could have asked , and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters . But banally , the answer to the question is quite clearly : " No , she did n't " . Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate , the film still manages to bungle it . All we actually get , sketched perfunctorily out at the end , is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event . Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place , where Christie 's wife says " you know what I mean  . " thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph ) . In the meantime , we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police , thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again . How exactly did he achieve this ? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point ; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police ; but how this all works or why , or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds , remains a mystery.<br /><br />I actually do n't believe serial killers are like this . The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff , but  Lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right . They are deeply disturbed , deeply dysfunctional , deeply inadequate people ; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here ( closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie , or indeed even Man Bites Dog , though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />This film has little suspense , and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated . It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers , either generally , or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain . This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women . And oddly , what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented . The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory . Just one explicit shot , properly timed , would have been infinitely more shocking , and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary , freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation . Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear . Very , very creepy . I 'm sorry to be rude ; I love horror films , and can tolerate even the most extreme , to the extent even of worrying my partner . But I think anyone who finds this film good , or interesting , even I 'd find myself edging away from . The purpose of a horror film is to scare you ; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed . I have to give this film more than one star just because it 's competently executed , but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made .
0 The name ( Frau ) of the main character is the German word for " Woman " . I do n't know if that was intentional or not , but if sure got some giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year , when it was shown.<br /><br />But those were the only giggles the movie got . Not that it was aiming for giggles , it 's a horrible movie for heaven 's sake ! A horrible movie in more than one meaning . It 's a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer ( definetely not for the faint of Heart ! ! ) ! And it was n't even necessary to show all the things that are shown . I 'm not even going into a moral obligation ( because movies do n't really have that kind of task or function ) discussion of what is shown here , but this is a new low on the whole " torture movement " that has grown in the last few years !
0 I read some comments on the internet about this film like " ... harder then Hostel ... " , " the camera never screens of when it 's getting really brutal ... " . But none of them is true . The camera never screens of , because there is nothing to screen of . The same scene is repeated hundred and hundred times again . Women lies on a table , killer rapes women a few times , killer cuts women into pieces ( you never see this during the whole film ! ) . Police come and arrested him . Killer fools the jury . Film over . In Germany we would say : " Viel Lärm um Nichts " . All in all , one of the most boring films I ever see . Absolutely non - recommendable .
0 This self proclaimed " very talented artist " have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century . Lack of emotion , coherence , rhythm , skills , humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over again . It shows no character development . It does not even show any violent and/or sexual content , and it does not add anything new to the psycho - killer sub genre . So lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of " what not to do " in a first movie.<br /><br />BTW where the hell is the " talent " ? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically ; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason . The camera almost never moves , as if the " very talented artist " was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills . The actors playing the main roles act like amateurs , and the supporting cast is hardly believable . There are more holes than plot in the script ( if ever there was one) ... <br /><br />A really disheartening movie , and a whatsoever talented director .
0 I absolutely adore the book written by Robin Klein , so I was very excited when I heard that a movie based on the book was in the making.<br /><br />But I was severely disappointed with the movie when I did see it because it did n't capture what I loved about the book - the absolutely ridiculously funny Erica and the interesting way in which she views the world.<br /><br />From the start of the movie , I realised that things were n't the same as I had imagined in the book . So , I just went along for the ride . It was n't all that bad , I guess . Miss Belmont was totally different to what I had imagined her to be ! I did n't think she would be one to smoke and drink - Jean Kittson , who plays her , is hilarious!<br /><br />On it 's own , I thought the movie and it 's actors / actresses in it did a good job , but alas , I 'm such a fan of the book ( one of my all time favourite books ) that I could n't help but feel disappointed = P
0 i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good , but i was wrong its bad . but when i saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and i really did n't know how old the 2 girls was trying to be i was so confused . the film was in some parts confusing and i did n't enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it did n't , it was boring , dull and did i say BORING.and i do n't think many other people liked it as well as me.boring boring boring
0 " Die Sieger " was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in Germany . I watched it last night and I must admit , that I am deeply disappointed . If that is supposed to be " the last best hope " for entertaining and challenging German action cinema , well then there is not much left.<br /><br />"Die Sieger " tries to be sexy , daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind . The characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected ( which does n't happen too much ) the act against their nature . That makes it hard - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them.<br /><br />Most of all I think the film is very bad cast . There is not one character in whom I believe . Maybe the superior officer at the SWAT unit - but that 's about it . Those people that try to look like or act like special units , like elite cops - I do n't believe them . Not for a second.<br /><br />The story is not so bad after all . But I think it 's badly told . You do n't get to know the bad guy at all - for example . And when after a " very dark " show down Karl Simon ( the good guy ) asks his already dead opponent " why ? ... what for ? " I did ask myself that very same question , knowing , that Dominik Graf would n't have the answer.<br /><br />I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better , even with action films .
0 I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing that I can tell you right away , there is NO comparison . This film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive . A martian that took different shapes . Special effects that looked like something that a little child would create . In contrast , in the original , characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin . The only highlight in this film , yes , actually there was one , occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end . He wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the TV series . But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey .
0 Silly , often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on Tim ( Jeff Daniels ) and the people in his orbit.<br /><br />Am always amazed by Daniels . He showed such depth and promise in 1983 's " Terms of Endearment " as Shirley MacLaine 's philandering son - in - law . As the years have passed , Daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good , meaty role . Instead , he is in inane comedies such as " Dumb and Dumber." < br /><br />As for this picture , it fails because of the subject matter . At least , the television show brought about a variety of situations . In the film , we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian - Martin.<br /><br />The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non - success of the film . On television , Pamela Britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed . In the film version , a blond bomb - shell as Brown , tries romantic entanglement.<br /><br />Television star Ray Walston has a small role as a government agent , or is he really that?<br /><br />A very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much .
0 I thought that My Favorite Martian was very boring and drawn out ! ! It was not funny at all . The audience just sat through the whole movie and did n't laugh at all ! ! ! Not even the kids laughed ! ! That is sad for a Disney movie ! ! I thought they could have found somebody better to play the martian rather than Christopher Lloyd ! ! He was really stupid ! ! And he was not funny ! ! I thought the talking suit was really dumb ! ! ! In the original television series the suit does n't talk and move around ! ! In my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie ! ! I give it two thumbes down ! ! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anybody ! ! ! Thank You ! !
0 This movie tries hard , but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s TV series , that I am sure people do remember with fondness . Although I am 17 , I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun . Sadly , this movie does little justice to the series.<br /><br />The special effects are rather substandard , and this was n't helped by the flat camera - work . The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour . Other films with under - par scripting are Home Alone 4 , Cat in the Hat , Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.<br /><br />Now I will say I liked the idea of the story , but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early , and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy . And I was annoyed by the talking suit , despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.<br /><br />But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd , Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah , all very talented actors . Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before , but he did n't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing , and Elizabeth Hurley 's character sadly came across as useless . Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored , and I liked the idea of her being the love interest , but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them ) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative . Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better , and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit , and I am fond of Back To The Future ) but he was given little to work with , and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.<br /><br />Overall , as much I wanted to like this movie , I was left unimpressed . Instead of being fun , it came across as pointless , and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential , with some talented actors and a good idea , but wasted with poor execution . 1/10 Bethany Cox
0 I saw this bomb when it hit theaters . I laughed the whole time . Why ? Because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane . I look back on it and realize there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie . At leat nothing intentional . It IS awfully funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic , carnivorous demon ... yet her itty - bitty little dress is perfectly intact , despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on . Or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious , and return to conciousness without ANY medical attention . And do n't let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the " villain " that they decided they needed to create " conflict . " Uh huh.<br /><br />To the person complaining about Disney only targetting kids - The raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement . Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes ? You do if you 're Disney and you 're out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above-8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script ! I am thoroughly convinced that Disney pays off the ratings board so it 's movies can get away with murder and still get family - friendly ratings.<br /><br />What a waste of the DVD format .
0 I think my summary sums it up . I found it inane and stupid . I also saw the ending a mile a way . Everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a TV / Theater crossover anymore . Sometimes , it 's better to let the movie stand alone.<br /><br />Others , its better to forget the movie altogether . This is one of the others ....
0 The movie starts little cute . There are a number of revolting scenes . People in toilets . GOOD actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here . This did not need to be crude.<br /><br />Forget it . Find the tv show . Disney at new low .
0 If this movie had not been labeled a Disney picture , I probably would not have been so disappointed . The nudity was unnecessary and did not add anything . The same can be said for the toilet bowl scene . This is one Disney film that I will not let my four year old nephew watch .
0 My ten - year old liked it . For me it was hard to get through it . Christopher Lloyd played it way over the top and the suit was tedious and unfunny . Sorry to see Jeff Daniels in this .
0 < br /><br />Cheap - looking and ugly , this film did n't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience , except for one fairly amusing toilet joke . Christopher Lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role , although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers do n't help .    Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role . Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation . There is really no reason to make this movie , especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with Robin Williams 's often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy.<br /><br / >
0 So so special effects get in the way of recapturing the interesting relationship between Uncle Martin and Tim O'Hara that we remember from the TV series . And what was with the suit ? Annoying !
0 The folks at Disney have a lot to explain . First and foremost , why anyone thought this lesser - sitcom material would ever make even a half - decent motion picture . In the kooky 60 's teleplay , the unique idea of Martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated X - Files treatment . Quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of E.T. , CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1 - 3.<br /><br />Any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the unworldly visitor . The conceit that Martians have antenna seemed dopey back then . Now it seems positively idiotic . Yet , Christopher Lloyd 's Uncle Martin sports the metallic appendages . In an early shot , the antenna on a sign for the TV station Tim works at is supposed to make us think " martian " ! When 's the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears , eh?<br /><br />Disney does n't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth - wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named Zoot ! Yes , you read that correctly - Uncle Martin 's silver space suit speaks . He is supposed to be a real hilarious cut - up ! Figure again . I got stretch socks that are funnier than Zoot . Whenever the action lags ( and it lags constantly ) , computer graphics are put into play to liven things up . Tim is here played by the amiable Jeff Daniels , who ca n't ( or wo n't ) do anything to save this floudering mess . Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role . Even Ray Walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings - all to no avail . This alien visitor is dead on arrival.<br /><br />Constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the I DREAM OF JEANNIE movie wo n't feature a talking harem outfit . I pray that Samantha 's cat in the movie BEWITCHED does n't have lines . I live in fear that I LOVE LUCY - THE MOVIE will proudly feature a CG Conga Drum named Bongo.<br /><br />Paging Michael Eisner ! Mickey Mouse - take me to your leader .
0 We should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there . Only five others joined before the movie began.<br /><br />There is nothing at all to redeem this movie . The acting is awful ( especially Ms Hurley ) . The script is banal . The effects we 've seen a million times . The film direction the worst that we 've seen . Meandering and disjointed . No - one laughed including the kids.<br /><br />We left after 25 minutes . It would have been sooner if my wife had n't gone for a hot - dog!!!<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this film . If there 's nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks , popcorn and hot - dogs and do some people watching . You 'll have a much more enjoyable time!!!<br /><br / >
0 When I was a kid we always used to be babysat , and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema . This is one of the films we watched . This is one of the stupidest films I 've ever seen , I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures film ! A martian is dropped on earth , turns into a human , befriends a human , and is trying everything he can to get back home . But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth . The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors , Back to the Future 's Christopher Lloyd as the martian , Uncle Martin , Dumb and Dumber 's Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara , Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie . But apart from that it 's complete crap . Poor !
0 The story is similar to ET : an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home . While its stay on our planet , it will create friendly ties with humans.<br /><br />But , unlike ET which exudes drama , comedy , poetry , this movie is only fun . It is indeed a pure Dysney production : its core audience are children & the movie is more more in the visual than in the message.<br /><br />Thus , you will find some funny scenes ( the first sighting of the town , a " cosmic " stray toaster ) and the casting is experimented , with special mentions to " Doc " , who rejuvenates in a " Mac Fly " character , and to Hurley , who seems open to auto - derision.<br /><br />Ice on the cake : the main title is scored by Danny Elfman , and like every other great composer , you recognize his " voice " before he is even credited .
0 Why on earth is Colin Firth in this pointless film ? Has he really been that strapped for cash?<br /><br />The film is n't clear on what it wants to be about , grief ? , exotic places ? , ghosts ? , a vehicle for Mr Darcy ? It 's a muddled , muddy mess.<br /><br />There seems to be some sort of idea that Italy must be good , in itself , and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland.<br /><br />There are pointless episodes on the beach , in churches , on busy roads - but what it is all about , or why anybody should care simply is n't clear.<br /><br />There was also a yank woman in the film . It was n't clear what here job was , but she seemed only to be there to make vapid , inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl . Was it supposed to be about paedophillia??<br /><br />A pretty dreadful mess , all in all . I gave it 2 rather than 1 because it does n't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film .
0 This is one of those films the British Lottery Fund wastes its money on . The main problem is a rambling script which gets nowhere . The characters are not interesting , the story is conventional and insipid , the only thing of interest is the location : the city of Genoa ( Genova in Italian ) . Having only a superficial acquaintance with Genoa , I had no idea of the intricate alleyways of its Old Town , and that the city was so interesting . I had thought Genoa was dull . I am delighted to say that I have been proved wrong . So from the travelogue point of view , this film has interest . The film contains one splendid performance , by a little girl named Perla Haney - Jardine . She has already made seven films despite being only 12 , so she seems determined upon a career as an actress , and judging by her performance in this film , she should go far , as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent . Colin Firth , a reliable and professional actor , was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest , he was earnest , and when asked to be anguished , he was anguished . But somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue . The script is a total shambles . Catherine Keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role , and showing sympathy comes naturally to her , so that everybody would like to have her around ( I would like to tell her every time I feel a cold coming on , as I know she would get me a soothing hot drink ) . So there we have it : Genoa 's fascinating narrow alleys , an interesting little girl , and a sympathetic woman . Forget the rest . The older sister played by Willa Holland is such a disgusting character that the fact that the young actress does a good job of being repellent is not exactly the kind of acting tribute she would like to hear , I suspect . The notion that this family go off to Genoa to forget the unfortunate death of the mother is so trite that if we have another film like that , all dead mothers have a right to complain at being exploited . If Michael Winterbottom wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of Genoa is , why did n't he just go to the BBC and say he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celebrity presenter ? Why waste money on a feature film which is nothing but a vanity project of idle and meandering vacuity ?
0 First of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note : A 10-year - old girl , playing around in a moving vehicle , decides it would be funny to cover up her mom 's eyes with her hands , and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom .... duh .... I am sorry , there is positively no 10-year - old that dumb . The rest of the movie does not get much better . After the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10-year - old on the planet , the dad moves the family to Genova , Italy , where he is to teach at a local university , but here is the clincher : he does not speak a word of Italian ! Then the little girl has " visions " of mommy ( who she killed ) , and often subsequent night terrors which always , always end by the father holding and coddling her . Then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found ( followed by of course more hugging and crying ) to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid , ignorant people off the planet . Do not get me wrong , because I love indies , but an indie about dumb people ( and I mean really dumb ) is simply ridiculous and pointless . It is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios , because the locale was interesting .
0 Without reiterating what was said above about this movie , I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film ... the cast / location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc ... It had a vague shadow of ' Do n't look Now ' about the storyline from the beginning . A stay in different surroundings ( Italy again ) to dim the heartbreak of loss ... or perhaps that 's how I saw it ? So consequently I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country .... and I sat there and sat there .... and guess what ? nothing actually happens ! and I mean nothing ! ! You are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous .. You are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it 's head ... The eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys , had great scope to take the movie in another direction , the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise , the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age . It felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect . When the credits started to roll ( unexpectedly ) you ca n't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish .
0 This film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother / wife by moving to Genova , Italy.<br /><br />The plot of " Genova " sounds promising , but unfortunately it is empty and without focus . The film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family , such as swimming , taking piano lessons or cooking eggs . Most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome , completely failing to engage viewers emotionally . The ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular , moving or emotional . I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by " Genova " The only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova . " Genova " can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city , but not as a film to be enjoyed .
0 I just blew four dollars renting this movie ! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me . But even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this film . I 'm tired of our media justifying a film simply because it 's Canadian and low budget . It 's like they expect Canadian films to be lousy , so they give it a good review regardless.<br /><br />Now about the movie : The acting was below average ( with the exception of the lead male character , who was actually pretty good ) . The film quality was poor , which I guess could be expected from the extremely low budget . The script was absolutely horrendous . An example is the story , which revolves around one of the lead characters , a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang , whose only purpose is to randomly destroy SUV 's . Supposedly many of her gang members ' bicycles are destroyed in these activities ( I do n't know how she ca n't afford to just buy new ones , since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from Vancouver to Toronto).<br /><br />Anyway , the point of the story ( which is n't revealed until well over halfway through the movie ) is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the Toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable - as no one will want to live in the area.<br /><br />- Need I say more.<br /><br />Shame on the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film , Telefilm for supporting it , and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews.<br /><br />A film should n't get special treatment just because it 's Canadian ! ! ! !
0 EPSILON , a.k.a . ALIEN VISITOR , is not what I expected . This is a no - budget Australian film with no special effects other than speeded - up film and quick scene cuts . The female alien ( who comes over immediately able to speak perfectly accented Australian ) can " blip " from place to place or time to time and alter her perception of the flow of time to match the " faster " humans.<br /><br />An elderly grandmother tells her two granddaughters about a story a wandering man told her 40 years before , when an unnamed " She " came to the planet naked and completely disoriented , unable to recognize which star in the sky she came from ... She meets a man alone camping in the Australian Outback , apparently bewildering him . She is here by " mistake " , and gets angry when she is told she is on Earth . The Earthlings are known as consummate despoilers of the environment and a metaphor for the most insulting thing imaginable to the rest of the universe : those who " breathe the foul air " but do nothing about it , sticking their heads under the sand like an ostrich . In another amusing metaphor , Earthlings are " frogs".<br /><br />From there , it is entirely a film about dialogue , as the perplexed man tries to understand She 's peculiar psychology and viewpoints , even as She calls him unintelligent and " quaint " . The man begins to realize maybe it 's humans who are irrational and not thinking straight . Yet , while waiting to be " beamed up " back home , She sees that this human is not entirely faulty in his thinking and even falls in love with him.<br /><br />The dialogue about perspectives is in spots interesting , but it is all layered with a heavy - handed environmental message and a low - budget feel ( there are only two main actors , who blip around various deserted scenes , and the evil despoiling humans on the planet are never seen at all ) . The environmental message offers no solutions , but paints one or two dire metaphors about what will happen to nature and man if something is n't done . The logic also does n't hang together : the rest of the universe has " given up " on Earth , yet one space woman caught on Earth by mistake manages to effect some positive change by the conclusion of the movie . What would a battalion of aliens deliberately sent here manage to achieve against pollution and waste ?
0 < br /><br />Not only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak English ( with an Australian accent ) they ALSO call their stars by the SAME names our Earthly astronomers have given them!<br /><br />And topping all that off , all alien life knows just how mean , evil , wasteful and destructive us humans are . And they 're quite willing to tell us just how bad that is.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to see this movie , do n't . Well , unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia.<br /><br />This movie tries to get a moral , ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon .
0 It was 1 a.m. in the morning and I had nothing else to do . Do n't judge me ... please.<br /><br />We're back in time during the Spanish settlements . A group have made their way onto an island . It does n't take too long before they encounter a large " reptile " , which gobbles up their horse . Soon they 're captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the " reptile gods . " THE CG sucks ; it reminds me of the CG of early console video games . The encounters were lame . The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit . Otherwise it 's just a middling effort .
0 I 'll bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary scouting expedition to Mexico before taking on the Aztecs . Good thing he did because he would never have known about those T Rexs that inhabited one particular valley where the locals revered them as gods.<br /><br />That was understandable . What was n't was the casting of blue eyed Ian Ziering as Cortes . Even with the blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black , Ian looked positively ridiculous . At least he made no attempt at a Spanish accent.<br /><br />The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late of a television series with a semi - recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of the Dallas PD . He finds true love with an Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it was n't for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship.<br /><br />Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous Sid&Marty Krofft series the Land of the Lost . All that was needed was some Sleestak to appear.<br /><br />If you 're interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that did n't quite make the history books by all means check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca . Then try and sit through it with a straight face .
0 With nothing better to do I decided to check out " Aztec Rex " ( as it was being billed ) for the hell of it.<br /><br />The silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing . They actually looked like animatics ( those rough designs that artists later use to finish the CGI effects , adding more details , smoother movements , etc . ) Absolutely awful - looking dinosaurs , which is the only reason you 'd probably want to sit through this anyway.<br /><br />The one redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl . She kept my interest ; if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used.<br /><br />Disappointing . At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii , where the movie was filmed .
0 Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternative / revisionist history , and you get " Aztec Rex . " Apparently Hernand Cortes , before conquering the Aztec empire , had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate . That 's the thrust of this movie . Given the plot it could have really sucked ; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers . There are a few problems . For starters , Cortes is played by Ian Ziering . Even with a black wig , Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi . And though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico , the Aztecs here seem to be played by an all - Hawaiian ensemble . Casting aside , the T - Rex(es ) look reasonably good , though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed CGI . And they die too easily ; I suppose if a T - Rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary , 16th - century weaponry . But it takes something away from the movie . There are also some graphic T - Rex - swallowing - human scenes , which is surprising , but in this context I thought they worked OK . There 's plenty of action , and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but does n't overwhelm the dinosaur angle , unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur movie " Warbirds . " Overall , a mediocre ( but decent by SciFi Original standards ) movie that rates a modest 4 .
0 I do n't know if this is one of the SyFy Channel original movies , but that 's exactly what it feels like . A cheap , low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly , it contains laughable effects , lame dialog , and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it ( funny how many of the kids from 90210 are doing cheap TV movies now).<br /><br />Ian Ziering plays Cortes , who we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of native people while conquering parts of North America . Here , he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic , but as a slimy opportunist ; his character would probably be killed off if this were n't loosely based on a historical figure . In this story , Cortes is on a brief surveying mission , trying to find something of value to prove he deserves financing to further explore America . He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs.<br /><br />The actual hero of the story turns out to be Lt . Rios , who proves to be honorable , resourceful , and wise . He knows the right thing to do in every situation , which puts him at opposition with Cortes , as well as with the young , ambitious Aztec shaman . Of course , the native girl who is supposed to marry the headstrong , scheming shaman falls for Rios , furthering his anger towards the Spanish outsiders . So it 's all pretty cliché . The dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease . Despite taking place in an area that seems wide open , the story pretty much takes place in either the woods , or the Aztec village for 95 % of the time , so it is n't visually exciting either.<br /><br />I did n't even recognize Ian Ziering . They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent , and somehow he disappeared into it . He does n't look or sound Spanish for a second , however , making the casting choice wrong in every way . If this movie had been released theatrically , he would have been singled out for a Razzie , no question.<br /><br />Overall , forgettable .
0 Tyrannosaurus Azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes ( Ian Ziering ) has landed in Mexico with six of his best men including Lieutenant Rios ( Marco Sanchez ) , they intend to claim the land in the name of the Spanish & maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises . Within minutes they have their first sight of local Aztec savages , within minutes after that Cortes & his men are captured & held prisoner . If that was n't bad enough it turns out that a couple of Tyrannosaurus Rex live there & like to eat the locals , in an effort to win their lives the Spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas & ulterior motives it 's not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for ... <br /><br />Directed by Brian Trenchard - Smith ( who , coincidently , made one of my all time favourite exploitations films Turkey Shoot ( 1982 ) which I throughly recommend to one & all ) & also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of Aztec Rex ( the title was changed by the Sci - Fi Channel when they aired it maybe as the original title Tyrannosaurus Azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film ) this is yet another idiotic & cheap looking Sci - Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' & that 's all you need to know really . Based on & around the real Spanish Conquistador Cortes during his expedition to Mexico the film definitely does n't strive for historic accuracy although I will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately Tyrannosaurus Azteca is still just a ' Creature Feature ' with a bunch of people running from some poor CGI computer graphic of a monster despite it 's period setting . Not too sure what else I can say , despite being set centuries ago the usual clichés are here , the character 's are the usual cardboard cutouts , make stupid decisions & the selfish one , the heroic one , the backstabbing one , the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten & the pretty woman are all here & easy to spot . The film is predictable , silly , dull & does n't really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace & there 's one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you . The story is n't that good & has plenty of holes too , this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days.<br /><br />Now I have seen & commented on plenty of Sci - Fi Channel ' Creature Features ' & usually the CGI computer effects are terrible & while Tyrannosaurus Azteca does n't exactly buck the trend I will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards . There 's a few decent gore effects here too , there 's a cut out heart , a guy 's leg is bitten off , there 's some blood splatter , a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur , there 's a few dead bodies seen & someone is stabbed with a spear . The T - Rex gets to eat a couple of people too . The production values are really cheap , the Aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from Styrofoam & those Spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist , they could have simply stepped out of it & run away it was so low.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $ 900,000 I ca n't see where the money went , shot in O'ahu in Hawaii in apparently fifteen days . The acting is n't great from no - one I have ever heard of.<br /><br />Tyrannosaurus Azteca really is n't any better than any other cheap Sci - Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' despite an almost interesting & unusual premise , that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not ( at a guess probably not ) .
0 To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence , but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now . maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too .. To say this was awful is to do this film a mis - service , if you want to see something that is totally execrable , you got ta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching ' sickle ' , that is soo mind numbingly awful , its actually good,(several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though . Any road up , I enjoyed this film and its got ta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet , just do n't expect anything along the lines of ' jurassic park , the lost world ' or ' apocalypto ' .
0 I have never seen one of these SciFi originals before , this was the first . I think it only fair to judge the acting , direction / production , set design and even the CGI effects on the other SciFi movies . To compare it to your typical Hollywood production is unfair . I will say , however , that overall Aztec Rex was not exactly reminiscent of Werner Herzog 's masterpiece Aguirre , Wrath of God.<br /><br />I will begin by noting that , yes , I do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture - clash than it does with dinosaurs . Despite this being a made - for - TV sci - fi movie , there is some underlying context to the story which I shall examine . The symbolic elements included are evident enough.<br /><br />Consequently , as a student of history , theology , mythology and film : I found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting . I am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers - as I said before the movie is what it is . But what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity.<br /><br />The main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character Ayacoatl ( not a commentary on Dichen Lachman 's performance , but simply how her character was written , although , I 'll say she has some work to do before she receives any Emmy nods ) . It is through her character that the Spanish Europeans actions are justified . Her function in the film as the love interest of Rios affirms that the European way is the right way , simply because they are European . There is really no other reason given . It 's really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the Europeans over the Aztec because their dress , language , ideology , etc is more familiar to them than the Aztec - so therefore the Aztec are portrayed as adversarial and ' backwards . ' And it 's not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part , but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer - As if the Aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan - if not a better one - to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticks.<br /><br />In fairness , there is a subgroup of the Spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native MesoAmericans . There is also a scene where we have the Christian holy man noting the achievements of the Aztec : " They have agriculture , medicine , calendar , etc . " - But in the end it is still the Aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie , even over the ' thunder lizards ' ( more on that later ) . He his portrayed as treacherous , duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic European Spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms - an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native Meso & North Americans ( again , more on this later ) so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the Spaniard . < br /><br />Now in analyzing the true nature of the story ( leaving the obvious Christian vs. Pagan themes off of the table ) from a symbolic standpoint - a viewer can easily take these so - called thunder lizards to be representatives of the MesoAmerican ideology / theology , which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on : bloodthirstiness , mercilessness , cruelness , wicked , maybe even evil ? In opposition , we have this group of Christian wanderers , led by a young Hernando Cortes who are portrayed as naive , yet overall noble , lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the Aztec . Also , the name of the film is Aztec Rex , leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people . However , what Aztec Rex translates to is Aztec King , a the head of the Aztec state , or in this instance ' state - of - being . ' ( Hence , why the title of the film was changed ) . And so who in fact do we see as the new Aztec king at the end ? It 's the remaining Spaniard , Rios . Aztec Rex is in reference to the new European ideology which overcame , through disease , bloodshed , war & famine , Native Americans . Rios symbolizes the ideal European - as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered ( in opposition to Cortes who represents the ' practical - yet - still - noble European ' ) . But when you examine the Holocausts of the Americas , let us be honest : do n't the symbolic components of this film 's story have it backwards ? < br /><br />I have to say Aztec Rex is at worst a little racist , or to be kind about it , ignorant at best.<br /><br />And yes , I know it 's just a movie , all meant to be in fun , I understand , but so at the end we 're left with the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines ? I wonder what Native MesoAmericans would have to think about this ending ... as for myself , I thought it was a little too self indulgent.<br /><br />Best supporting performance of the movie goes to Ian Ziering 's wig - although conspicuous - it did at least alter Ziering 's appearance enough so that I did n't think I was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness . Ziering actually proves himself to be a more - than - capable actor in this movie , I actually bought his performance , or at least I forgot it was Ian Ziering anyway . I do n't know whom his agent is , but he should get more work.<br /><br />In closing , it was also a pleasure to see Jim McGee again . I 've been a fan ever since his all too brief scene - stealing performance in 1988 's Scrooged.<br /><br />Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
0 All day now I 've been watching dinosaurs , and all day they 've had the same fundamental problem.<br /><br />They do n't believe in firearms . They just do n't seem to have been _ told _ about them or something . Bullets _ bounce _ off of dinosaurs ! Maybe it 's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder , and the laws of physics were just different back then ... Aah , no . Come on . If they 're close enough to chemically operate today , they 'd have to be vulnerable to fast ( even subsonic ) lead projectiles . It 's that simple.<br /><br />Look , the toughest - skinned reptiles on the planet today , alligators and crocodiles , are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire . They 're nothing magic . You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs . They do n't take armor - piercing bullets or anything special . Small bullets penetrate them , they just do n't kill them . Somewhat ( but not REALLY ) large bullets are preferred because the challenge ( as with most game ) is to kill the animal with one shot , so it does n't run . ( Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested.)<br /><br />Most animals , including predators , are easily repelled by gunfire . Between the noise , and the pain of even a non - lethal wound , most will run away . An exception are big bears , which are so fearless that they 're merely enraged by mortal wounds . Cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded . We 've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions . A big cat will run if it can , but if it ca n't it will charge as a final act of desperation . Where a T.Rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown . Their behavior simply has not been observed . With these larger animals , safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile , and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge . With a T.Rex , of course , this could be a serious problem . I 've seen a T.Rex skull ( they have one in the museum downtown ) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical . Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach . Small bullets would still _ penetrate _ them , they would n't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill ! < br /><br />So here we have Cortez and his men ( this is _ before _ the famous Mexican campaign , apparently ) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid . It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of T.Rexes that terrorized the continent in the day . Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards , Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them . OK , maybe they do n't have M-16s like the guys in the " Carnosaur " series , but they _ do _ have flintlocks , crossbows , pointed sticks ( big ones , made from trees ) and swords . Maybe that 's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto , but they 've several guys and I 'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur . Oh , wait , there 's a _ cannon _ , about a 4-incher . That 's just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus ' skull ! So they lay a trap , with a squad of men , cannon , pointed sticks in a ravine , and lure the first T.Rex into it , using a pretty brown girl as bait . Cortez points out that they 'll NOT have time to reload , so they 'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim . T.Rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire , and we see both a crossbow bolt _ and _ the cannon ball _ bounce _ off ! Forget it . End of credibility . A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez ' torso armor , and a 4 " cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship ! This would also _ certainly _ get through the hide , ribcage , or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet . ( Do you think a _ whale _ could withstand a 4 " cannon ball ? ) And here 's T.Rex , still standing , not even bleeding . So Cortez lures it to the ravine , where it falls onto the pointed sticks , which ( I guess by magic ) penetrate it and kill it . Yaaay , pointed sticks ! < br /><br />The dinos are n't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol . This runs it off , so it 's NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo , at least in the movies.<br /><br />They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones . My money would still be on the cannon . It 's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder 's energy in one direction - toward the target . A bomb is a much more diffused application of force . A _ real _ bomb ( NOT a gourd bomb ) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure . ( Think : pipe bomb vs firecracker . ) A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF . ( Trust me on that one . )
0 Typical Troma - trash , this smutty 80 's flick is considered one of the " highlights " of Lloyd Kaufman 's notorious production studio , alongside " The Toxic Avenger " released one year earlier . " The Toxic Avenger " is far superior if you ask me , but this demented splatter - flick is nevertheless endurable as well ; just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door . The events take place in Tromaville , a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world , and they certainly are n't lying . The safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard , to say the least ( even Homer Simpson never was this nonchalant ) and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school . The first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd , who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities , but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than TWO microwave ovens in his house ! Oh , the humanity ! Shortly after , however , the nuclear leaks also affect the school 's weed plantation and thing really start to get messy . After smoking a joint at a party , the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum . " Class of Nuke 'em High " is bottom - of - the - barrel horror film - making , with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make - up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless . If you enjoy watching faces melting away , getting crushed or splitting in half , this is definitely a must - see ! Unlike the aforementioned " The Toxic Avenger " , this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens , like for example when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what 's wrong with their hormones . The crude humor is n't as effective as in " Toxic Avenger " and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish . Proceed only if you 're an avid Troma - fanatic .
0 Tromaville High has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear plant 's accidental release of toxic waste.<br /><br />Unrestrained chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior . Rather horrible , obviously intended to be , mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up . Craft was far down Troma 's list of objectives for this gory sleazefest . The honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits . The German teacher who becomes a member , through a " toxic kiss " has the streaks down one side of her face that really gave me the creeps . The toxic monster , which dispatched the ANNOYING punks towards the end , is pretty cool , though.<br /><br />Kind of movie trash connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly .
0 This film might have weak production values , but that is also what makes it so good . The special effects are gross out and well done . My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady . She is super hot and also has a good nude scene . Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious , as are the other members . This film is actually trying to make a point , by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad . 4/10 Fair comedy , gross out film .
0 I absolutely adore the ' Toxic Avenger ' series , but this weak offering by the Troma people did n't make any sense , and it had me yawning all the time.<br /><br />A leaking nuclear plant ( and the growing weed next to it ) makes the youngsters of Tromaville High go nuts , which causes them to join a gang , have sex , explode , and whatever . Also there 's some sort of monster breeding in the high school ... my God , this movie 's a mess.<br /><br />The actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should . The ( intended ) overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /><br />Disappointing . 2/10 .
0 What to say about this movie . Well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people . Two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school 's basement . That is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes . This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever . Though that is not fair , some people like Troma 's movies and they can watch it if they want . Troma movies for me though , are the worst movies there are out there . I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity .
0 It looks to me as if the creators of " The Class Of Nuke ' Em High " wanted it to become a " cult " film , but it ends up as any old high school B - movie , only tackier . The satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters . It 's very un - funny , even for a turkey .
0 This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen . It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps . The movie starts out bad ( I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10 ) and then it get progressively worse , minute by minute . The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety , long minutes . Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video . Somehow the video manages even to make cute , scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful . This movie is amazingly bad . I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemi 's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie . The sequels are not nearly as bad . If you have to rent a Troma film , get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock . I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again . Do n't get me wrong , it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful , this is it .
0 First one was much better , I had enjoyed it a lot . This one has not even produced a smile . The idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall , but in reference to the characters not the film - maker .
0 I saw Arthur(the TV series and the books)years ago and never was fond of the show very much(if you 're a fan of this cartoon , sorry if I 'm spoiling it for you , but this is actually what I think).Lots of people liked it , but I didn't.<br /><br />The school kids characters seemed to fought all the time(especially Arther and DW),they were nice to each other frequently , but gradually I got tired of Arthur 's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister DW(however the name was spelled),and DW was an ADHD(or ADD)-like 4-year - old sister of Arthur who was sometimes demanding(which could be why Arthur got annoyed with what her routines were , like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc.),Arthur 's friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the Arthur books , and the parents , well , they did n't care very much.<br /><br />The greatest cartoon was Rocko 's Modern Life , not Arthur(no offense ) .
0 This programme bugs me ! There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called " fun " ! It 's just far too educational for my liking ! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing . The plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again . Where 's the fun in it ? Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much . Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes ? I think it 's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like : Inspector Gadget , Bananaman , The Smurfs , Snorks , Moomins , the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows ! I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse , so what 's going on with that ? ! 3/10
0 Like all cult TV shows , there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows EVER . While several of them are indeed wonderful classics , the truth is for every great episode , there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank . However , like die - hard Trekkies , these Zone lovers insist that all of them are gold . In fact , this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies I usually watch.<br /><br />While this is n't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst , it is poor by any reasonable standard . A widow watches a long procession of Civil War soldiers going past her home . In the end , a very unexpected twist is revealed and there is n't a whole lot of excitement or suspense here .
0 Curiously , Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts , based on this outing for the " man - in - the - mac " and also " Fade into Murder".<br /><br />Furthermore , it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts ( incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here).<br /><br />This adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material . The story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation.<br /><br />Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here(similar to " Last Salute to the Commodore " ) but the entertainment value is minimal . To add to this , Celeste 's Holm characterisation , which is intended to provide comedy , induces embarrassment rather than laughs.<br /><br />The script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift Columbo the case , though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime.<br /><br />Ironically , what turns out to be , arguably , Columbo 's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series . He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut / manicure at the same time . The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it 's just that Columbo 's hair is so perfectly groomed , then he ca n't afford to pay the bill and then , when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle!<br /><br />Sadly , this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes . < br /><br />For Columbo completionists only .
0 This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the " Night Gallery " show back in 1971 . The episode starred Sue Lyon ( of Lolita movie fame ) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire , respectively . The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child ( which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster ) while he goes out at night for blood . The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire 's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror , has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult , and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child . She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally . She bolts out the door , the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over . I do n't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes . They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one . A total wasted effort .
0 This movie is a pathetic attempt , apparently , to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau . In order to do this , they cast a 19-year - old -well , probably not " in order to do this . " There was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out ( if they had even been allowed to do them ) - as they should . Mary Ann 's boyfriend was my nephew 's age , making her a pedophile . Sixth grade , people . The definition of pedophile does n't have to include many children - all you need is one.<br /><br />I really do n't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage . She had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to . The reason given is that she is bipolar , rejected the diagnosis , and refused to take her medication . It 's understandable , then , that she was not thinking rationally . One hopes that she now understands her actions.<br /><br />Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together , I pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearly.<br /><br />All that aside , Penelope Ann Miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role .

After viewing this this " docudrama , " this vague and haphazard farce , a viewer wonders what anyone 's motivation was.<br /><br />This inept offspring of daytime T.V. ( the Oprah show ) missed by a mile a great opportunity to explore weighty issues.<br /><br />Its characters were all shallow and superficial , its story line far less socially redeeming than a " Simpsons " episode . It gratuitously portrayed investigating police as unprofessional and incompetent . It failed to offer why the court might treat the main character , a female child molester , so differently than it would have a male perp.<br /><br />Why did this unrepentant woman begin " grooming " her second grade student , beginning an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade class ? Why did the boy 's mother testify in her behalf ? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism , plus generational rationalization and greed . The movie gave no hint of that.<br /><br />Why was n't the viewer informed that the victim 's mother sold interview rights to print and television tabloids , parading her adolescent son on " The Today Show " ? That Mary Kay 's lawyer cashed in , she herself appealing a " Son of Sam " statute so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder?<br /><br />Why was n't it explained that LeTourneau 's father was a former right wing Republican congressman , the 1972 American Independent Presidential candidate , the John Birch Society President ? In 1983 John Schmitz 's political career ended when he was found to have had children by his own community college student , exposed only when that mistress sexually mutilated their infant son ? Yet Letourneau 's dad had removed his many kids from " too liberal " Catholic schools , fighting to keep all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education?<br /><br />A month after her conditional release , again pregnant with the now 14-year - old 's second daughter , Mary Kay received 7 1/2 years in prison for numerous probation violations . A prophetic editorial regarding the sad affair then appeared in the Seattle Times : " At the end of two wretched hours , LeTourneau was led off to jail , and this salacious melange of made - for - TV seaminess was over , until casting begins." < br /><br />Sure enough , 18 months later , filming of this travesty was underway .
0 This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner . Along with other such nasty films as " The Burning Bed , " " Enough , " or " Monster , " this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she 's not such a bad person after all . Give us a break ! Here 's my question to the filmmakers : If LeTourneau were a man , and Vili were a 12 year old girl , would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person ? Answer : Hell no.<br /><br />Imagine switching the genders in this film , and then you 'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage . Were the genders switched , there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal . Instead , we 'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl , his lascivious behavior landing him in prison , and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome . The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex.<br /><br />Let 's call a spade a spade . LeTourneau is a pedophile . Plain and simple . No ifs , ands or buts . She 's a criminal who belongs in prison , and deserves our derision and contempt , but certainly not our pity or empathy .
0 Saw this piece of work at a film fest in CA . My god , what was the director thinking ? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film . First off , this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . The film takes place partially in " The Waystation " , some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere , where nothing really takes place.<br /><br />THe acting is beyond bad . So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy . The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films . There is one or two decent performances , including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but it 's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians . The only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue , which bordered on absurd . The writer ( whom I assume is also the director ) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.<br /><br />The overall production value is pretty good , but to be honest , with a film this bad it 's easy to overlook it . The production design is pretty good , although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar . The costumes and make - up are okay , and I understand the production was working with a low budget . It 's just when the characters speak , or they try and push the plot forward , the film unravels into a muck of crap.<br /><br />As I 've said , this film is god awful . It 's like the director / writer watched a lot of sci - fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this . My only hope is that he used other people 's money on this , because if he used his own , he 's a total sucker .
0 Wow , this film was just bloody horrid . SO bad in fact that even though I did n't pay to see it , I still wanted my money back.<br /><br />The film is about nothing intelligible . It 's a mish - mash of sci - fi cliche 's that were done better by much more skilled film makers . The performances , especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing Ed Wood sort of way . Speaking of Ed Wood , he 'd be proud of the character 's dialogue . It 's just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor . On top of that , it does n't make sense , nor does the plot , or lackthereof.<br /><br />The visual effects are okay , but not enough to go " oh wow , that 's cool " and they just seem to be thrown in to " be cool " rather than be a good plot device.<br /><br />The soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood . Again , it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to " be cool".<br /><br />Which brings me to my final point . Perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot , story and dialogue instead of trying to " be cool " , he would n't have made such a dorky cliche ' of a short film.<br /><br / >
0 OK I caught this film halfway through , but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts.<br /><br />Especially that guy who is now in Teachers and the Book Group , although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to ! ( the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting , scripting and general plausibility ) It quite clearly appears to be a cash - in on Human Traffic , but whilst that is not the best film ever , it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest - yet - hopeless GCSE students trying to get a pass grade . Not so much as Human Traffic as a bit of a car crash !
0 As far as films go , this is likable enough . Entertaining characters , good dialogue , interesting enough story . I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in.<br /><br />Glasgow . In Scotland . Yet every character is English ( save for Sean 's girlfriend , who is Dutch ) . Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles . As a Scottish woman ( & as a viewer who likes her " real life " films to be a bit more like real life ) I really do n't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent ! The futile attempt at using the word " wee " a few times did nothing but to further the insult .
0 Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they 're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves.<br /><br />This film is set in Glasgow ( although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent ) . The premise , about people who 's lives are going nowhere , who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs , COULD have made for a really funny , insightful , quirky , cultish film . Instead we have a group of self - obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits I 'm suprised it has n't been banned . X and Y are friends . X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well . Oh you figure it out.<br /><br />A total waste of time . Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE drama project . The female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it.<br /><br />If you 're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on Saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it " a right laff " . Everyone else , run , do n't walk away from this sorry little misfit.<br /><br />And one question , when the group left the " boring " seaside town ( Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film ) , to go back to Glasgow , WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway services at LANCASTER which is in England ?
0 Such a pretentious and lame attempt to hipness . Diabolical script and dialogue and truly embarrassing acting . Really the worse movie I have ever seen(at the cinema ) . Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster . I saw it when it came out in a cinema in Brighton . People were walking out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium ! At the end there were boos and scorn from the meagre crowd left , which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really sheepish . However the movie was that bad that I really could not feel like that sympathetic with them . Everybody has to start from somewhere and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at ' Tarantinism made in the UK ' . 5 years have gone bye , but sometimes I still cringe at the memory of that sad night at the movies ! This is a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever ! I gave it a 1 as 0 was not available . They should invent a ' shameometer ' for everybody involved in this sorry mess of a movie . I know some of them have moved on to better things , the positive thing is that none of them could have sank any lower than this .
0 The idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked . Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that . When we do get to a point , it is so monumentally moronic that I kept thinking I must have misunderstood it . But I didn't.<br /><br />Sean tells the story of an Osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so did n't realise they were sharing . His friend asks " But what about the weekends ? " Sean does n't have an adequate explanation . Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem , which is that he is n't sure his girlfriend is still living at home as he works during the night and she works during the day so they never see each other . This has been going on for three weeks . But his friend does n't ask : " Yes , but as I said before , what about the weekends ? You must see her then . It does n't make sense . What are you going on about , Sean ? Are you on medication or something ? " But let 's be generous and assume that they both work seven days a week.<br /><br />We see Sean checking to see if the soap and towels have been used . ( In fact , bizarrely , he starts to carry the soap around with him . ) But what about his girlfriend 's conditioner and shampoo , sanpro and moisturiser , toothpaste and toothbrush . Let 's go to the kitchen . What about food and drink ? Is any missing ? Has any been bought ? In the bedroom , has the shared bed been made or not ? Are her clothes being used and exchanged for clean ones ? Is the laundry basket fuller ? In the toilet , is the seat up or down ? I mean , good grief!<br /><br />And to cap it all Paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home . Why does n't he just phone her?<br /><br />But it gets worse . In the last act although no - one told Vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them . Lenny 's love interest and Sean 's girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group . There is n't even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences.<br /><br />To be fair the dialogue is OK but not nearly good enough to make up for the weak characters or annoyingly lame story.<br /><br />I heard one of actors interviewed and he promised " no guns , no drugs , no corsets . " I thought , " great " . But after half - an - hour of tedium I was yelling at the screen : " I want guns ! I want drugs ! I want corsets!" < br /><br />It would n't have taken much to sort these problems out but on the official website the director boasts that the film was n't script - edited . That 's all you need to know .
0 Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down . Even in the most trying of circumstances , Day gives 100 % and usually comes out unscathed . This comedy , perhaps inspired by a real - life New York City black - out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late-'50s French play by Claude Magnier , gives Doris little to do but spoof her own goody - goody image and , in the second - half , be comically sedated ( which is amusing because of the spin Day gives to the situation ) . There are some funny lines here , yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play ... and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the Big Apple , we get stuck in the suburbs . Doris ' co - stars ( Patrick O'Neal , Robert Morse , and Terry - Thomas ) are not well - suited to her , and neither is the shapeless hairdo they 've got her wearing . Still , it 's not terrible , it features a few big laughs , and for Day - buffs it 's a must - see . * * from * * * *
0 Only the most ardent DORIS DAY fan could find this one even bearable to watch . When one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about New York City 's most famous blackout , a film that could have dealt with numerous real - life stories of what people had to cope with , this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story - telling originality.<br /><br />Once again Doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her Connecticut lodgings , took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same , wandering into the house by mistake.<br /><br />Nobody is able to salvage this mess -- not Doris , not ROBERT MORSE , TERRY - THOMAS , PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT . As directed by Hy Averback , it 's the weakest vehicle Day found herself in , committed to do the film because of her husband 's machinations and unable to get out of it . Too bad .
0 For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video , skip this one . The producers decided to get creative and make this 80 's video something of a sci - fi story , involving the evil Barbarella villain from which the band got its name . < br /><br />What makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80 's Duran Duran songs , confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts . Not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted , but we have to suffer through some cheap spin - off story hosted by an evil Dr. Mario . It 's almost too much to bear . 2/10
0 Ooof ! This one was a stinker . It does not fall ' somewhere in between Star Wars and Thriller ' , that s for sure . In all actuality , it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham ! video and Captain EO , only with not as big of a budget , and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying . Simon Le Bon preens front and center , while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from Roxy Music 's last 3 albums . Brief clips from Barbarella add nothing . Avoid at all costs . ( However , I liked the part when they played ' Hungry Like The Wolf ' but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes ? I mean , they are n't singing ' Eye of the Tiger ' or ' Hungry like the Tiger ' it 's a Wolf ! Whatever . ) A DVD of Duran Duran 's ' 80s videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia 's sake
0 It was 1974 and it starred Martin Sheen.<br /><br />That alone says what to expect of this movie.<br /><br />And it was a movie . According to the movie , Slovik had reformed , got a good woman , and did n't want to fight.<br /><br />In real life , Slovik may have been a naive innocent , or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system.<br /><br />Whoever Slovik was or was n't is for history to decide , but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting , and the movie took sides.<br /><br />With no regard to servicemen who were in Viet Nam either in 1974 ( as Willie Nelson would say , let 's tell the truth , it was about the Viet Nam war , not WWII ) , EoES was as propagandistic as Gung Ho was in the forties.<br /><br />According to this movie , Slovik stated his position , plain and simple . He had a nervous problem . Heck , I have a clinical nervous condition , and trust me , if I had done military duty , it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on KP duty or latrine duty with no problem.<br /><br />If we believe the teleflick , Slovik did n't have that option , no doubt because of his criminal history.<br /><br />Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer . I 've learned that movies from this decade or that decade , in dealing with service or military duty , will pretty much take the same stance over and over.<br /><br />1940s and 1950s , serve your country.<br /><br />1960s and 1970s , mock your country.<br /><br />This is the history.<br /><br />The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me . He refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion.<br /><br />Such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition , but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful.<br /><br />I'm not a Catholic , but I thought the recital of the hail Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end , with the Lord 's prayer , was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster.<br /><br />I do n't see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Viet Nam war.<br /><br />I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example .
0 Too bad , I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey . But the director failed to put this together . There 's a lot of action , a lot of promise , but it all comes off hokey . The director did n't do his job . Promising action comes off lame . So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film . This version of " The Rage " ( DirecTV credits it as 1996 ) simply is n't worth the time to watch it . Another director would have done a better job .
0 Aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot , this movie was n't too bad . Unfortunately , that does n't leave much movie not to suck . Do not waste your time on this film , even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia , as I did . Watch an infomercial instead .
0 Of all the films I have seen , this one , The Rage , has got to be one of the worst yet . The direction , LOGIC , continuity , changes in plot - script and dialog made me cry out in pain . " How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy " ? Gary Busey is know for his " B " movies , but this is a sure " W " movie . ( W = waste).<br /><br />Take for example : about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer . Inside the jeep is MA and is " confused " as to why all the cops are about . Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues , MA being killed straight off . The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them . The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet / pellet . MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed - damn that guy is tough . Truly a miracle , not since the six - shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle .
0 I have been a huge Lynn Peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie " Far North " , and even though I loved her in her one other film " Slow " ( 2004 ) where she plays " Francis " , this is by far and away her strongest role.<br /><br />Lynn , as I 'm sure you all know ( or should ) , plays the critical role of " Driver".<br /><br />Unfortunately , other than Lynn 's amazing performance , I 'm afraid this movie does n't really have much going for it.<br /><br />Oh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for TV viewers . Memorable lines like : " You son - of - a - gun ! " , " You son - of - a - witch ! " , " Shoot ! " , and " Well , Forget You!" < br /><br />O.K. Bye.<br /><br />P.S. : Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson poster ?
0 Cecil B. deMille 's 1922 parlor - to - prison tearjerker Manslaughter finds the lovely Leatrice Joy as a good - at - heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with . Her recklessness leads to imprisonment , which in turn leads to her regeneration . Thomas Meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in Lydia ( Joy ) but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released , it is up to her to rescue him!<br /><br />If the plot does n't sound too bad , you 'll be floored by the woeful presentation . The quality of deMille 's direction is very low , and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him . The photography is standard and flat , and the editing is hardly more dynamic . One could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct . DeMille gets to dress Miss Joy up in so many different types of clothes ( evening gowns , golfing costumes , motoring costumes , piles of furs ) that it 's subtitle could be ' Fashions of 1922'<br /><br />One thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting , which is mostly flat and wooden . When it is not , it is merely routine silent gesturing , rolling eye balls , twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements . What would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films , is here merely dull to watch . The only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is Lois Wilson , who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally . She is convincing and endearing in tearful close - ups , as long as you do n't read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak . Like I said , everybody else is droningly routine , Joy , Meighan , even Julia Faye . Her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom.<br /><br />The worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it . Meighan 's character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of America is declining in it 's moral stance , and going right back to the decadence of Rome . ( insert absurd flashback ) This movie 's moralizing has been described as Victorian , but it 's further than that . It has so little bearing in reality that I have a feeling audiences at that time did n't take it any more seriously than modern viewers could.<br /><br />This movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a ' typical ' silent movie , with it 's archaic moral structure , wooden acting and bad direction . DeMille shows that he could be a terrible director , with no sense of pacing , camera placement , or skill in handling either script or actors . I ca n't imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously . Boring , slow and idiotic , I recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only .
0 I am quite a fan of novelist / screenwriter Michael Chabon . His novel " Wonder Boys " became a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson . His masterful novel " The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay " won the Pulitzer Prize a few years back , and he had a hand in the script of " Spider Man 2 " , arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time.<br /><br />Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces , such as the gut - busting " Dodgeball " and the genius short film series " Terry Tate : Office Linebacker " . And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard , Sienna Miller , Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari , this seems like a no - brainer.<br /><br />It is . Literally.<br /><br />Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein , the son of a mobster ( Nolte ) who recently graduated with a degree in Economics . Jon is in a state of arrested development : he works a minimum wage job at Book Barn , has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend / boss , Phlox ( Suvari ) , which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex , with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion.<br /><br />One night at a party , an ex - roommate introduces Jon to Jane ( Miller ) , a beautiful , smart violinist . Later that night they go out for pie , and she asks Jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence , " I want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul . If you do , it will make this night indelible . " Jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by , yet none of them look him in the eye . " I imagine it must be what death feels like , " he says.<br /><br />The next day Jane 's wild boyfriend Cleveland ( Saarsgard ) kidnaps Jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill , and soon Jon , Cleveland and Jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts , doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol . This does n't sit well with Phlox , who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship , namely letting her meet his new friends and his father . The film then attempts to take us on Jon 's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father , Phlox and his dead - end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane.<br /><br />There is a problem having us follow Jon throughout the film : he 's completely uninteresting . He has no ambitions , passions or goals . He walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to Jane the night they met . At the outset this is n't a problem . But he never gets any more interesting . He 's a completely passive character . He simply follows along the bohemian Cleveland and Jane , but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.<br /><br />Consequently , the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party , have sex and get in arguments . In other words , much ado about nothing . What we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside . Sweeping cinematography , ponderous voice - over with characters staring off into the distance , lots of sex scenes both straight and gay , big arguments , more angry sex , a chase scene and a tragic death ... but it does n't seem to matter . Ironically , at one point Jane , confused at a number of Jon 's aimless actions , asks him , " What 's going on , Jon ? What is this all about ? " Yes , Jon , do tell . We in the audience are dying to know , too.<br /><br />The title " The Mysteries of Pittsburgh " must refer to the characters themselves , because that 's what they are . They are all facades , one - dimensional stand - ins for actual people . The film never lets us in . We never know what makes any of them tick . We see them do lots of things , but we do n't know why . And the absence of " why " is one of the worst things a movie can have .
0 Based on the novel by Michael Chabon , The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends . The year is 1983 , and young Art Bechstein ( Jon Foster ) is at a crossroads . Completely opposed to his father 's lifestyle , Art plans to become a stockbroker . Visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography , the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like Mena Suvari , Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte . Like so many of the star - laden premieres at Sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio - sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right .
0 A friend of mine gave me this movie . A friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a DVD casing from his * * * . < br /><br />I got quit excited by the prospects of an other Michael Chabon movie . After all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great , but boy , was I wrong.<br /><br />First off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so . I imagine the castings went something like this . " Tell me , do you like fish ? " " Yes I enjoy fish very much . " " Wonder full , you 're hired . Have some money . " < br /><br />Than there is the script . I have read Chabon , who I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong , and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel . I 'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did , but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one - liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out.<br /><br />This is an actual line from the movie ; " If you tell me something that you 've never said out loud to anyone before , than this moment becomes unique ! " Unique ? Does it ? Does it really ? Off course not you plank . Please pass me the Imodium . I 'll have a whole * * * * ing strip . < br /><br />The directing is ... well . I 've got nothing . Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something . Stick to directing comedies . No stick to directing commercials . < br /><br />This movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age . I give it 2 stars because I do n't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie .
0 ... they bothered making this movie ? Anyone ? I did n't think so.<br /><br />If you are looking for a coming - of - age movie , go rent Summer of ' 42 . This is no Summer of ' 42.<br /><br />When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard , & Sarsgaard gets more screen time , that is your first warning sign And , of course , for such an " artsy " movie , there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around , just to make it look " artsy".<br /><br />Sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting , cardboard character , punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense . The intensity is that of someone with bi - polar disorder.<br /><br />Miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie . Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her . She misrepresented an actual Pittsburgh native.<br /><br />Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style . Wow ! Was this his first role after high school graduation?<br /><br />So , we have this weird triangle . Foster has a crush on Miller , but is with his boss / girlfriend . He ca n't take Miller to bed , & wo n't take his boss to bed . So , he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller , & watches them get it on.<br /><br />Then , after one of Sarsgaard 's pseudo - intense moments , Foster & Miller get it on , a scene that we are " treated " to in every sloppy , moaning detail . Finally , just to round it all out , Foster & Sarsgaard get it on , with Foster in the Miller role . Now I know how 2 guys get it on ( as if that was ever anything I needed to know).<br /><br />After all that , all that 's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2 . It gets me right in the pit of my stomach . Oh , wait ! That was the pepperoni pizza I just had.<br /><br />I'd like back the time this movie took out of my life , please .
0 Wow . What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel . Here are just a few gripes . - The screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book . - Plot has been grotesquely altered . - Voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages ( which may read well but are not the same when spoken , especially with Chabon 's writing style ) . - The acting is more wooden than a log cabin . ( Esp . Bechstein ) - This is supposed to be set in 1983 ? ? ? Feels more like 2003 ... < br /><br />To be fair I could n't bring myself to finish watching this movie , so it 's possible that it redeemed itself ... ( sarcasm ) . I truly hope that no one paid to see this , or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent ( a la Wonder Boys ) . I like Chabon as a writer but he should be ASHAMED of this adaptation.<br /><br />No stars .
0 Noel Coward , a witty and urbane man , was friends with Louis Mountbatten . Mr Coward , a long - time admirer of all things naval , was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of Mountbatten 's ship . In a peculiarly British way it was considered that a film about the Royal Navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda . It was also considered a good idea to have Mr Coward play the part of the ship 's captain . Amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship , the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated " point " songs does not come very high up the list at Admiralty House , or at least one would hope not . A captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike . Mr Coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at Drury Lane and Binkie Beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame , mould and direct a ship 's crew in wartime must be brought into question . He folds himself languorously around the bridge , patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers , he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home . Much is made of the " warship as a microcosm of British Society"theme , and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys , canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought . They spend most of their time on board smoking , moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up . Never mind , there 's plenty more where they came from . Once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking , moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up .By contrast Mr Coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up . He , his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames . That nice young master Johnny Mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships Mr Coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master . He marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek , presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion . So yes , we do have a microcosm of British society here , but perhaps not in the way the makers of " In which we serve " intended . At the end Mr Coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him,"Goodbye Edwards , it was a privilege to sail with you"he enunciates as if he was reciting " How now brown cow " . It may have been David Lean 's feature debut , but the hand of Noel Coward looms large right across this picture . He was a funny and clever man , better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song . He had a talent to amuse , no doubt , but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue . Being Noel Coward was a full - time job , he had no time to be a real person .
0 A battleship is sinking ... Its survivors , hanging onto a nearby liferaft , sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks.<br /><br />Even though Noel Coward 's name is the only one that you notice during the credits , everything that 's cinematic in it is because of Lean . And on technical terms , its very good . David Lean just KNEW films from the get - go . There are many moments where Coward 's studied dialogue takes a second seat and Lean 's visual sense takes centre stage . Try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end , and that whole scene ; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing , the scene where we 're inside a house that gets bombed.<br /><br />Noel Coward is one of the worst actors i 've ever seen . He 's totally wooden , not displaying emotion , character or humanity . You can see it in his eyes that he 's not really listening to what the other performer is saying , he 's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line.<br /><br />7/10.<br /><br />Its episodic , a bit repetitive , and the flashbacks overwhelm the story : there 's no central story that they advance , just give general insights into the characters . Still , its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for Lean . Its not a very deep or penetrating film , and its definitely a propaganda film , but its also a showcase for Lean 's editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together .
0 This is your typical Priyadarshan movie -- a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission . His signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money . Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly , black money in Hera Pheri , " kodokoo " in Phir Hera Pheri , etc . , etc . , the director is becoming ridiculously predictable . Do n't get me wrong ; as clichéd and preposterous his movies may be , I usually end up enjoying the comedy . However , in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor , ( Hungama and Hera Pheri being noteworthy ones ) . Now , the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.<br /><br />Songs are good . Tanushree Datta looks awesome . Rajpal Yadav is irritating , and Tusshar is not a whole lot better . Kunal Khemu is OK , and Sharman Joshi is the best .
0 Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name , his first thought would be ' comedy ' . That is what this man is known for , or rather , was known for . After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama , Hera Pheri and Hunchul , his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I ca n't recollect for now . Now with hideous films like Dhol , the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- ' torture'.<br /><br />Dhol is a mixture of bad , unfunny toilet jokes , somewhat of drama , poor suspense and idiocracy . The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny , though not witty , and secondly , except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma , the acting was decent . < br /><br />Speaking of the acting , I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top ( if you compare them with the others in the movie ) , then came Tusshar Kapoor , then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above . The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting . The grandma , firstly resembled a ghost , plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.<br /><br />The plot was the same , seen before one . Four boys behind girls and in need of money , but with a few twists . There is a ' bad ' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb . And at last , the good wins over the bad and everything is fine . The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is its length . After an hour or so , you get exhausted and want to leave the theater . But being a critic , it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie . THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.<br /><br />If your mother - in - law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything , then send her for this movie and have fun . 3 out of 10 .
0 The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller , with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar , Sharman , Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring There is a bored sub plot of Tanushree 's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait , there is also a long chase in Payal 's house < br /><br />The film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep < br /><br />Direction by Priyan is very bad music(Pritam ) is routine except the first song < br /><br />Cinematography is bad , the film has a cheap look throughout < br /><br />Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor is n't loud and over the top like other films But No , He becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film , his dial delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace , He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult , But does n't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is a non actress Murli Sharma is terrible
0 Another Priyadarshan / Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP rather than actual desire , the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie ( Akshay Paresh and many others ) , but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.<br /><br />I was happy with the casting in general except , Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys to no limit , he does however extract some laughs , but these were those standard slapstick non - original jokes , in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol , I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise , or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it ? ? Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner , for an extended period who are considered great.<br /><br />Which brings us to the other instrument , the Dumroo hardly requires any talent , it has no variations , and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances ( hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav , good analogy ) , but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does.<br /><br />This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played , sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo , sometimes both together , but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced . And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored.<br /><br />The movie has some good Dhol ( good ) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo ( entertaining initially , then tolerable then irritating ) , the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on " MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA " ( if you have n't watched it watch it on Filmy , it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).<br /><br />This movie had its moments , the actors did a fine job , except Rajpal Yadav ( who can act though , I 've seen him in Main Meri Patni  ) who annoys more than entertains , I 've said it many time and I 'll say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi - star comedies especially.<br /><br />Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father , the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.<br /><br />But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added , this mean that once the girl was in , the following 45 - 60 mins was increasingly torturous , the climax was " SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY " , I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.<br /><br />The movie is also extremely predictable , there 's hardly a scene you ca nt predict and you wo nt be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here , its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.<br /><br />The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump , down or up , and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.<br /><br />Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end , one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy , also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition , THE LAST 10 - 15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />I did n't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play , and her acting talent is in serious question , especially in view of her non - appealing looks , if you ca nt be a HOT and ca nt act how much time can you survive.<br /><br />Technically also this movie was weak , with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera - work.<br /><br />The songs except the title track were no good either , when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience.<br /><br />In all a movie that 's just ordinary merely because of the cast , and the very low expectations.<br /><br />Avoiding it wo nt be a bad idea.<br /><br />And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must , if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.<br /><br />-s lots of stale jokes , RAJPAL YADAV , LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY , bad technically , bad songs.<br /><br />+/-s tries to be more than what it was , not the regular cast ( I 'm happier for it ) , Tanushree Datta.<br /><br />+s some good scenes towards the beginning , title song , good acting and cast except RY.<br /><br />total 4.5/10 ( I 'm trying to be objective here , i do n't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations , so I 'm giving it the benefit of all doubts , on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4 )
0 A typical Goth chick ( Rainbow Harvest looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George ) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom ( horror mainstay , Karen Black , the only remotely good thing about this travesty ) buy . The acting 's pretty laughably bad ( especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror ) and there are no scares or suspense to be had . This film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last . People looking for a similarly themed , but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of " Friday the 13th : the Series " where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror . That packs more chills in it 's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it 's 4 films.<br /><br />My Grade : D < br /><br />Eye Candy : Charlie Spradling provides the obligatory T&A
0 ` In the tradition of ' Carrie ' and ' Heathers ' ? Try ` a shameless ripoff of not only those two films , but ' The Evil Dead ' and ' The Shining ' as well . ' That said , they really do n't make bad horror movies like this anymore , and that 's a shame , 'cause it 's a gas.<br /><br />Rainbow Harvest is the Winona substitute here , and although she barely does more than mumble her lines ( and occasionally scream , ` YOU'RE UGLY ! ! ! ' into her haunted mirror ) , she 's Goth way before it 's fashionable , so you have to respect her . ( And she 's quite creative about it too , accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black - spray - painted Hawaiian - Punch - guy hat . Eat your heart out , Cher.)<br /><br />Karen Black overacts a bit , but she 's not totally without dignity , and you ca n't help but sympathize with her . ( Unless you 're a certain friend of mine , who asked , ` Who is that , Horse Lips from ' M.A.S.H ' ? ' the first time she came onscreen.)<br /><br />There are decent supporting performances by Kristin Dattilo ( as the square chick who befriends Rainbow ) , Ricky Paull Goldin ( in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role ) , and William ` Larry , Darryl and Darryl ' Sanderson ( as some kind of pet undertaker , or something ) . But it 's sad to see the once smokin ' Yvonne DeCarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the Charlotte Rae part.<br /><br />The eighties were the heyday for hilarious , mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this , and ` Mirror , Mirror ' was one of the last of its kind . Definitely worth a look .
0 I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it ( I thought she was great in American Gothic ) but sadly she did n't have a very big role in this film . It starts off OK and the pace moves along nicely ... but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull . That 's not to say that this is a boring film , but it 's just very average and nothing spectacular . I did n't like the " posession " side of it and there were no decent gore scenes . Plus the ' main ' story was very confusing and the ending does n't make much sense at all . I did however like the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors.<br /><br />I would n't particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it 's nothing to wet yourself over .
0 Mirror . Mirror ( 1990 ) is a flat out lame movie . Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger ? Who knows ? Maybe I was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another . I do n't know , I guess I needed a hobby during my teen years . A teenage outcast ( Rainbow Harvest ) seeks solace in an old mirror . Soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her . Movies like these , the power giver has a nasty side effect . This one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not.<br /><br />A mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d.v.d . a few years back . I do n't know why . They should have left it on the shelf and collect dust . People love this movie foe some reason . If you do I would like to know why . Until then I dislike this movie and I have no reason to ever watch it again.<br /><br />Not recommended at all .
0 I 've been using IMDb for a few years now , but have never written any reviews before . However , this movie so disappointed me ( even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing ) that I could n't keep quiet anymore.<br /><br />Noise is the story of a New Yorker ( Tim Robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter - ego as a as a vigilante , " The Rectifier " , and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car - alarm sounding.<br /><br />I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer . Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned , the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms . Car alarms , car alarms , car alarms . There is really no other focus . When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms , it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins ' character . < br /><br />Yes , we 're all annoyed by noise . Nobody likes the sound of car alarms . Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle , and this movie uses that fact , and pretty much that fact alone , to sell this movie . I say ' pretty much ' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship ( including a completely needless threesome ) which is obviously thrown in for those movie - goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie . Honestly , it 's eye - rolling.<br /><br />Robbin 's character , very shortly into the movie , becomes completely unrelatable . It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore , and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity . The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry , car - bashing dude into this hero of the little guy , The Rectifier . However ... the transformation does n't take place . He just renames himself.<br /><br />I could go on for a while . Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie , and the self - satisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face does n't help either . < br /><br />Overall , I think it 's very obvious what this movie is trying to be , as it 's pretty much shoved down your throat , but in my opinion , it fails in a big way . Just one guy 's opinion , cheers .
0 What " Noise " fails to do is get us to understand its character . Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who ca n't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer , particularly car alarms . It 's an odd idea for a film , which has about as much creative credibility as " Death Wish . " It is clever at points ; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel , " I 'm too stupid to be understanding this . " He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion , we read it and do n't get it either . Just then a car alarm goes off . Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises . Though , all in all it does little to help us understand our hero , who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper - into his persona . < br /><br />The film - making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems , shoddy editing , and visible boom mikes . No , " Noise " is n't all - bad . William Hurt is at least colorful . At least the ending does n't fall flat . Overall it drives home a logistical point , one you have n't probably thought of . At least I had n't . Though all in all , ninety minutes long , it could n't have ended sooner . The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.<br /><br />This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival , but probably wo n't get picked up for distribution . Check it out on DVD if you 're really partial to someone involved in the project . Otherwise skip it .
0 This is one of those topics I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate noise & have no idea how those in big cities , New York especially how people get any sleep at all ! It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days . The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic . It 's too bad that 's about it . Tim Robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes ( especially with the absolute supermodel looking Margarita Leiveva ) he did n't seem to really be altogether there . My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot , Margarita Levieva . She does n't have a lot to do , but she is supermodel beautiful . Even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door . It makes me sad that there can be people such as Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world w / no redeemable skills or talent , to have more fame and success than this talented beauty . I did n't care for much of this film because the script is n't very good , but am glad I got to see some new talent . I hope that producers & directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film . If they can make Megan Fox a star ( c'mon she is n't that hot , & her acting " talent " is worse than made - for Disney channel TV shows ) from 1 film , it should happen easily for her , as she is gorgeous & has talent ! I 'd recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable . Here 's hoping this makes her career , & if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years .
0 WE FAW DOWN < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format : Silent < br /><br />(Black and white - Short film)<br /><br />Stan ' n ' Ollie get mixed up with a couple of floozies ( Kay Deslys and Vera White ) after setting out to visit a theatre which burns down in their absence ! Needless to say , their tyrannical wives ( Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers ) are not amused ... <br /><br />Leo McCarey 's OK comedy laid the narrative framework for William Seiter 's masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT ( 1934 ) , with L&H playing brow - beaten victims of circumstance , forced to tell a monstrous lie which backfires in spectacular fashion . Much of it is very funny , especially the scene in which Stan is teased by Deslys , leading to a violent game of push and shove . However , some of the fun is undercut by Oakland and Flowers , playing their roles completely straight , which adds an element of unpleasantness to the ' henpecked husband ' scenario . Originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP .
0 Why do movie makers always go against the author 's work ? I mean , yes , things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest , but look at Anne of Green Gables . They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful . I ca n't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a dreadful mess . Look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . Paul Irving , little Elizabeth , the widows , Windy Poplars . . . and Anne 's college years , for heaven 's sake ! ! ! Would n't it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang ? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time , instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did . This movie was good , if you leave the novels out of it ! ! But L.M. Montgomery 's beautiful work is something that should not be denied . This movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough Anne of Green Gables to life .
0 This movie is like the material S.E. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s , and , had Trueblood actually been a product of either , the results might 've been much better ( especially in the acting department ) . Instead , we get a rather so - bad - its - funny piece of mediocrity.<br /><br />Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood , a former street rumbler , I suppose is the accurate description . This was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music . Nonetheless , Ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother , Donny ( Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot ) , who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when , on the run from the cops , he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the Marines . Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs , although in a gang that was Ray 's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled ( and again , cops must be dodged and this time , a lady 's honor defended in the action film sense ) before Ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother , Donny.<br /><br />For the most part , the film is quite ridiculous . For me , most of this has to do with far too much overacting , although not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress he befriends . The guys in the gang and Lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as New York street toughs . Although , the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989 .
0 Three Russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of Monte Carlo , despite the fact they are down to their last franc . In order to support their lavish lifestyle , the three use the services of a counterfeiter , and use the notes at the casinos , hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot . Andrew Hughes , a US envoy , arrives at Monaco with his wife Helen , and the three decide to make pals with the visitors , hoping for financial assistance . One of the three Russians , Count Sergius Karamzin , plans to go further , with continuous advance towards Helen , while disappointing the Count 's maid , who loves Sergius . Eventually , circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats . Its obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message ( with the foolishness of American women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats ) , rather than tell a story , and the film really can bore modern audiences , like me , easily by doing that . Even the acting , which is great in later EvS like Greed and the Wedding March , is just run of the mill here . The film could have used improvements on various levels . Rating , 3 .
0 This was director von Stroheim 's third effort - it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks , GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH . Essentially we have a trio of grifters , masquerading as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo . Their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune . Part of that plan is for the Count ( von Stroheim ) to insinuate himself between a visiting American ambassador and his " foolish " wife , wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses . He makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid , whom he has promised to marry . When she sees them together , she sets fire to the room , ( von Stroheim and his prey are on the room 's balcony ) . Here von Stroheim first establishes his persona as " the man you love to hate . " He is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end . The film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director . There is a cute bit- when he first attempts to meet the Ambassador 's wife , she is reading a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim . This was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film , cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes . The restoration on Kino Video restores surviving footage ( damaged in some way in most scenes ) from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print .
0 Dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar . The movie followed with Beta , Ishq , Raja & Masti all of whom were superb.<br /><br />But then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too . Pyare Mohan is one such movie.<br /><br />Though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh . Comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb.<br /><br />If you really want to watch a movie and laugh , please do n't watch this . Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.<br /><br />In short , the movie is worth a miss .
0 This movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by Bollywood . The performances were horrible . Even Boman Irani , who always manages to shine , goes completely OTT as the villain . The soundtrack is not memorable either . And in spite trying hard , the female leads do n't manage to be " sexy " . Vivek Oberoi is capable of far better projects while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being . But this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor . Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in badly written cliché roles . It 's high time for Indra Kumar to hang up his directorial hat . Hope he never directs another eyesore like this . Future of Hindi movies are in better hands now . To sum it up , stay far away from waste of celluloid .
0 After the reasonably successful MASTI which was tad better Inder Kumar returned again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film SEE NO EVIL , HEAR NO EVIL < br /><br />The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE(1994 ) where Kader and Anupam play the blind and deaf < br /><br />This movie is a tedious exercise < br /><br />The film has jokes of such nonsense that you do n't feel like laughing like Snehal Dabi 's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we do n't laugh at now but mock < br /><br />The film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments do n't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring The twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all OTT chase scenes and fight scenes < br /><br />Direction by Inder Kumar is bad Music is okay , one song stands out I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL < br /><br />Vivek is awful in the comic scenes , his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes For some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career Fardeen Khan is tad better but too wooden Amongst the rest Esha and Amrita are the heroines Boman Irani annoys here Snehal Dabbi is okay
0 Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst - ever films made by mankind . The film , one of the many handicapped - people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity . Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people . While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world , Pyare Mohan shows two desperado - like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests . Anu Malik 's music is fair enough . Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema . Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry . Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore - mentioned desperados . Boman Irani , as the villainous Don Toni , is somewhat acceptable . Avoid the film if possible .
0 I 'm a big fan of movies that make you think . I 'm still thinking long and hard about this one , fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled . What 's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body , made extra - tacky by being filmed on cheap video . This happens three times and I was certain it would be explained in the end . I put my trust in the film - makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified . It was not.<br /><br />The movie has to be the most apathetic I 've come across in the genre . The sets look like a cross between a 1970s Dr Who set and someone 's ill - formed idea of a sponge - painted living room . The lighting is unimaginative ( if your sets are going to be that bad , at least film them in semi - darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance ) . Of the abducted quartet , the girl stands out as being particularly lame , but none of them is given a personality . The aliens ' plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved . Most of the movie consists of people running down corridors . Yes , it really is that exciting . The " ray gun " special effect is ... curious , to say the least ( what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill , and even then the guy comes back for more ? ) . The script is like a bad episode of The A - Team , and the ladies ' hairstyles come from the same era , so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders . When we finally get to see what the aliens really look like , they 're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes . The resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who 's never had an idea more complex than a Saturday morning cartoon ( I mean the bad ones with no plot , action , or characterization ) in his or her life.<br /><br />But seriously , what is with the naked chick ? ! Was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the DVD cover to boost sales ?
0 This thing was bad . Really bad . I mean , low budget can sometimes be very inspiring , but not this . The story was so off - the - shelf , the alien 's behaviour so illogical , the characters so clichéed . I found nothing good in it . And I did try .
0 The Christmas Secret was touted as a wonderful film , but I was truly disappointed . They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over , which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project . As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performances were phoned in , although Beau Bridges , as Nick , did have a moment or two . If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume . It was an embarrassment . I had been a fan since his Waltons days , but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work , so poor was this offering.<br /><br />In defence of the actors , the directing was stilted , mechanical , and thoroughly amateurish.<br /><br />I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic . I turned the movie on because it had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the film . However I would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back , even though it was on T.V.
0 THIS REVIEW IS MOSTLY ALL SPOILERS . IF YOU PLAN ON ENJOYING THIS FILM , DON'T READ THIS REVIEW.<br /><br / > That 's the problem with kids TV nowadays . It 's all so patronizing and condescending . ` Wow , that was fun , was n't it ? ' No it was n't . And unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well . And that is what ' Flight of the Reindeer ' is all about . Admittedly I have n't seen ' Flight of the Reindeer ' in a few years so I might be hazy on some points , but I remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time.<br /><br / > Essentially , the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas . Now , the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal . I think it was bullfrogs . Anyway , through this book , Mr Lecturer / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs . Apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the North Pole . Now , if it were me I would have thrown the book out the nearest window . Flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon , but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept . But , Mr lecturer ISN'T me , so I guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he 's gone . Of course , things go awry and before he knows it , a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he 's stranded at the North Pole.<br /><br / > Are you still following this ? Good.<br /><br / > His family , of course , are devastated . I would be too , I mean , what a suck - tacular Christmas . Elsewhere , Mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the North Pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white . Rather than try to escape immediately , as I would have done , he greets everyone there with open arms . This hidden civilization of midget monsters , and he greets them with open arms . Oooo - kayyyy . They feed him this story that they are the elves of Santa Claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist . And Mr lecturer accepts all this . He even accepts that Santa Claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever . There 's just one problem - they do n't want him to leave . The world ca n't know of their secret existence . After all , before they 'd know it there 'd be a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every street corner.<br /><br / > Still with me?<br /><br />Now , Mr nice guy 's family find the book and assume he 's gone to the North Pole . Boy , would n't they be embarrassed if they found out he 'd just gone for a brisk walk ? Before the audience knows it , they 're jetting off to spend a Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet . Meanwhile , Mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave . I ca n't remember exactly , but I do recall him holding Santa Claus to gunpoint . A fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via Santa 's sleigh . With Santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes , Mr Whatever , through some marvellous co - incidence , finds himself flying alongside his family 's plane that is looking for him . So he jumps on to their plane , the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br / > The fact is , there have been some shocking films made in the name of Christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it . And it 's that charm that is utterly devoid from ' Flight of the Reindeer ' There is n't much wrong with it ; nothing which insults the intelligence ( well , obviously there IS , but it 's a kids film and thus can get away with such things ) or anything particularly offensive , but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either . It just does n't FEEL Christmassy . And for a film that is all about Christmas , that it a pretty major flaw . But hey , I do n't think ' Flight of the Reindeer 's target audience mind about that ? Why should they ? They 're all so doped up on sedatives they probably could n't spell ` Christmas'<br /><br / > I give it three out of ten . If it was a TV - Movie then I 'd add another two stars onto it . We all know how bad they can get .
0 If you want to watch a real ' quality ' movie get hold of The Eden Formula . This wondrous film must have cost all of $ 50 to make . It features a wafer thin script , pathetically bad sets , lighting and camera work , and a stop motion , paper - mache monster that is utterly laughable ( it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful ) . < br /><br />The actors all speak their lines as though they 've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter . The special effects are way beyond lousy . And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title ' Tyranasaurus Wrecks ' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes.<br /><br />This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath . < br /><br />I loved every minute of it .
0 My first opinions on this movie were of course bad . I was expecting a horrible , crappy acting , bad entertainment , ridiculous special effects movie . What I got was actually not that bad . The special effects were absolutely horrible , but I found the movie itself quite interesting , and the script was actually pretty good and decent . The acting was n't THAT bad , and overall I had fun watching this movie . It 's still a pretty bad film , but it 's not completely worthless like I thought it was going to be , and I 'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me , even when it was n't that good . Overall , it 's a film that should be avoided , but to me it was n't as bad as I was expecting it to be .
0 I got this as a turkey movie and was I not disappointed.<br /><br />Acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.<br /><br />Plot - being generous I could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it . the plot broke down faster then a Chinese knock off computer < br /><br />Scrip - now that was an abomination of nature . it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason . the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic . the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable . I have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.<br /><br />Special effects - ROTFLMAO ! ! ! ! ! They were short bus special < br /><br />Directing - until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this.<br /><br />It is good to know that your friends / family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie
0 You ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason ? Well , out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the T - Rex . Knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the T - Rex from Jurassic Park , I KNEW I had to rent this just cause I was in the mood for a bad movie.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />Mad scientists , secret formulas , a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives , and of course , a big , poorly animated , sock - puppet T - Rex . Is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies ? Not to mention the Rex 's hungry is never satisfied ... ever . How he has hungry is beyond me because he actually does n't have an throat ( Really if you look down his mouth when he roars , it 's solid ... like a toy or something ) . Now , I like watching incredibly bad B - Movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is . This one was hilarious . I 'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy , because there are scenes where , make no mistake , you will laugh . < br /><br />Do I blame the movie 's budget ... yes , but the acting did n't help either . OK , Tony Todd was actually pretty good , as for some of the female roles ... when you cry should n't " tears " come out ? Meh , I am not going to be angry at this movie , i knew what i was getting into and if you 're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends , here 's what I recommend : Watch this movie , then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back . You will be writing Mr. Spielberg thank you letters the next day .
0 I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less.<br /><br />Scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism . In their lab(a run down warehouse in L.A. ) , they create a T - Rex . A group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase.<br /><br />Of course the T - Rex(a rubber puppet)gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast . It has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off.<br /><br />One cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city . She is of such superior mental ability that she ca n't even operate the radio . She never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost.<br /><br />The T - Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city , there are blazing gun battles and buildings(cardboard mock - ups)blowing up , but a single police car , or the army , nor anyone else ever shows up . Such activity must be commonplace in Los Angeles.<br /><br />We can only hope that a sequel is n't planned .
0 This film is so unbelievable ; - the whole premise is bunkum ; the fact that a serial killer ( vampire or otherwise ) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable . The vampire himself would not look out of place in a Bela Lugosi film . Most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot . I await the day when someone makes a decent film from a Steven King novel ( with the exception , possibly , of Stand by Me ) . This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do - lack of money used for the " special " effects , poor actors , appalling characterisation and dialogue . This film is cheap , tacky and fails in everything it tries to do .
0 Would have better strengthened considerably by making it as a < br /><br />50 minute episode of the Outer Limits . Too much superfluous material and stuff like the chief bad guy looking like he 'd escaped from The Phantom of the Opera did n't help . The whole ' Night of the Living Dead ' sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary . After all , if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins , now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again ?
0 This is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a Stephen King story . Two tabloid reporters , one seasoned(Miguel Ferrer)and one not so accomplished(Julie Entwisle ) , begin to believe that a serial killer(Michael H. Moss ) may actually be a vampire . Stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally , but by way of a black Cessna he seeks his victims . The gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale . Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this film . I do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night .
0 SPOILERS All too often , Hollywood 's Shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema . Beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text . Films including Branagh 's " Henry V " and 1993 's " Much Ado About Nothing " are powerful pieces of work . Watching " Love 's Labour 's Lost " therefore , it 's such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste . Sadly " Love 's Labour 's Lost " is awful ! The King of Navarre ( Alessandro Nivola ) and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies . Plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic Princess of France ( Alicia Silverstone ) and her entourage arrive . Soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the Prince 's mind.<br /><br />From the start , you realise that this film is not quite Shakespeare . Cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by Ken Branagh , the plot is still there and the script remains , but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste . Classics like " The Way You Look Tonight " , " Let 's Face The Music and Dance " , " I 'm in Heaven " are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just do n't belong here.<br /><br />Aside from weak singing , we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars . Ken Branagh and friends might enjoy making this film , but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles.<br /><br />The main eight actors ( four men & four women ) are all equally dire , and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful Timothy Spall.<br /><br />In fact , only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that 's the consistently magnificent Nathan Lane . Lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester Costard.<br /><br />There 's little else to be said really . " Love 's Labour 's Lost " deserves mild praise for Branagh 's original take on an old tale . Unfortunately though , that 's where the positives end . Weakly acted , performed , sang and constructed , " Love 's Labour 's Lost " is perhaps the weakest Shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years . It should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made . A poor , disappointing choice by Branagh and here 's hoping his next effort is better .
0 This self - indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on Mr. Branagh 's career as an adapter of Shakespeare for the cinema . ( Released 4 years ago ; not a peep of an adaptation since . ) I just finished watching this on cable -- holy God , it 's terrible.<br /><br />I agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill . That being said , I 'll take the risk , if only because * Love 's Labour 's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who overrated Mr. Branagh 's directorial abilities in the past . Branagh has always been a pretty lousy director : grindingly literal - minded ; star - struck ; unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors ( he loves his American stars , but loves himself more , making damn sure that he gets all the good lines).<br /><br />Along those lines , the sad fact remains that * Love 's Labour 's Lost * is scarcely worse than the interminable , ghastly , bloated * Hamlet * from 1996 . In fact , this film may be preferable , if only because it 's about 1/3 the length . Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of Shakespeare 's to the milieu of Cole Porter , George Gershwin , Fred Astaire , yada yada . So he sets the thing in 1939 , leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of Thirties ' standards ( wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during " I 'm In Heaven " ) , and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing ( himself included ) . The result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just did n't call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies . I do n't even blame the cast . To paraphrase Hamlet , " The screenplay 's the thing ! " NO ONE could possibly come off well in this hodge - podge : the illustrious RSC alumni fare no better than Alicia Silverstone . Who could possibly act in this thing?<br /><br />Branagh 's first mistake was in thinking that * Love 's Labour 's Lost * was a play worth filming . Trust me , it is n't . It 's an anomaly in the Bard 's canon , written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers -- NOT the usual audience for which he wrote . Hence , there 's a lot of precious ( and TEDIOUS ! ) word - play , references to contemporary scholastic nonsense , parodies of Lyly 's * Euphues * . . . in other words , hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience . Hell , it does n't appeal to an audience already predisposed to Shakespearean comedy . The play can not be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately " updating " it with any gimmick that comes to hand . Which begs the question , Why bother?<br /><br />Branagh 's second mistake was in thinking that Shakespeare 's cream - pie of a play could be served with a side - order of Gershwin 's marmalade . Clearly the idea , or hope , was to make an unintelligible Elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic American pop culture down their throats at the same time . But again , this begs the question , Why bother?<br /><br / >
0 I think this is one of the weakest of the Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian works . After such great efforts as Much Ado About Nothing , etc . I thought this was poor . The cast was weaker ( Alicia Silverstone , Nivoli , McElhone ? ? ? ) but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the Bard 's work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical / dance sequences.<br /><br />You just do n't do Shakespeare and then mess with the play . Sorry , but that is just wrong . I love some Cole Porter just like the next person , but jeez , do n't mess with the Shakespeare . Skip this and watch " Prospero 's Books " if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest .
0 I 've read comments that you should n't watch this film if you 're looking for stirring Shakespearian dialogue . This is true , unfortunately , because all the stirring dialogue , this wonderful play contains , has been cut , and replaced with songs . I 've read this play , and recently was lucky enough to see it performed , at it remains one of my favourite Shakespearian Comedies , but this movie seems to take all that I like about it away . The Princess , though no doubt doing what she was directed to do , had no regal bearing , and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts , which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue , but took comments out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear the Princess proclaim ; " We are wise girls to mock our lovers so ! " , when mocking had not taken place at all . The news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow , and took away many excellent scenes , as they showed the information in the scenes after them , and were in modern phrasing . In conclusion , an excellent play , ruined by an odd concept , and unwise cuts . Kenneth , I usually love what you do . What were you thinking ?
0 Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn William Shakspeare 's obscure , rarely - produced comedy into a 1930s - era musical , with the result being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both . Particularly painful is Nathan Lane , who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard but is badly mistaken , and Alicia Silverstone who handles the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged Valley Girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school English class.<br /><br />The musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of " Dames at Sea , " leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing , with the lone exception being Adrian Lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man . The only other saving grace of the film are Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer 's contribution as eye candy , but they have given far better performances than in this film and you 'd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass .
0 I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director ca n't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it . If it 's using the original words in an updated setting , that 's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles , eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively . It could work with the 30 's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeare 's text . Unfortunately , it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show . < br /><br />Another problem is Branagh himself . I agree he 's far too old to play one of the students but more important , he 's such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student , his strength of acting shows all the time . Of course he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students . Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King , thus an unimposing so - called King with no Kingly attributes . < br /><br />The amount of song and dance , which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing , unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically . So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection , and I got very bored , including with the comic turns , and was glad when it ended . Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production.<br /><br />Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan , absolutely splendid as the older couple .
0 I am a Shakespeare fan , and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh has done to bring Shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers . However , this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences . Add that with Alicia Silverstone 's stumbling over the dialogue ( reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing ) and other poorly cast roles , it all equals an excruciating endurance of viewing .
0 " Carriers " follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen Mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car . Brian ( Chris Pine of " Star Trek " ) is driving and his girlfriend Bobby ( Piper Perabo of " Coyote Ugly")has shotgun , while Brian 's younger brother , Danny ( Lou Taylor Pucci of " Fanboys " ) and his friend -- not exactly girlfriend -- Kate ( Emily VanCamp of " The Ring 2 " ) occupy the backseat . This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare . Apparently , a viral pandemic -- which co - directors & co - scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about -- has devastated America . Naturally , the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies.<br /><br />This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die . Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band . Initially , this foursome encounters a desperate father , Frank ( Christopher Meloni of " Runaway Bride"),and his cute little daughter Jodie ( Kiernan Shipka of " Land of the Lost " ) blocking the highway with their SUV . Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them , but in the process , the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot . Reluctantly , they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV . She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood . Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it . Sadly , somebody has lied to Frank . The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool - Aid that will put them out of their misery . The cure did not improve their condition . Everybody else in town is dead . Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone . Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off.<br /><br />Indeed , " Carriers " qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves . They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump - action shotguns . Incredibly , our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot , but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse . Eventually , they discover that one of them has become infected . Later , as they are about to run out of gas , Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset . Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car . Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help . Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them . Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger , but he kills her . < br /><br />No,"Carriers " is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non - existent . By the end of this 84-minute movie , our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight . Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun - loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum , while the only other well - known actress , Piper Perabo , is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role . As Bobby , she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price . It is a testament to Pine 's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others . Essentially , Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one - eighty from happy - go - lucky guy to heartless guy . < br /><br />The two directors are Spanish brothers , and they never let the momentum flag . Since there is no relief in sight , " Carriers " sinks into predictability . " Irréversible " cinematographer Benoît Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes , Debie makes it look like a dynamic film . Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word , " Carriers " suffers because it is so horribly cynical . The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense , but even it could have been improved . Unfortunately , the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense . By fade - out , you really do n't care what happens to anybody .
0 I really hate most end of the world movies . They show what jaded Hollywood people think of the rest of the world , and they clearly think we 're a bunch of sadistic idiots ( or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining ) . I 've been to L.A. many times , I have family that works in show business , and I just want to say that these are the * last * people we should be looking to for a reality check . Some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture : Children of Men , 12 Monkeys , but usually the message is just " people will do anything to survive , all is dark and sad and purposeless , we should all be ashamed of ourselves".<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people 's mettle in the face of horror , and I do believe some people would act like this film portrayed , but sadistic idiots aside , I seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself , that 's just insulting .
0 Do not be mistaken , this is neither a horror , nor really a film . I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure ; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine.<br /><br />Nothing happens . You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist , a hint of surprise , a plot to emerge - but no.<br /><br />The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet do n't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful ( bring on the teen rock montage ) state . The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic ' companion'.<br /><br />Their encounters with obstacles ( be they human or physical ) are brief , confusing and entirely pointless.<br /><br />Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast . Lou Taylor Pucci could n't be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert.<br /><br />Watch ' The Road ' , watch ' 28 days Later ' , watch day time TV ... anything but this ; I implore you . Suffer the boredom , unlike you may be led to believe in the film , this film is no cure .
0 If you 've seen other movies like this , they 're probably better . The Omega Man comes to mind . To the studio 's credit , they avoided the sprawling , unnecessary , big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk . Additionally , the set - up and premise were excellent : four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease . What 's bad is EVERYTHING else ! I get tired of endlessly stupid , careless , wimpy , ineffective , arrogant characters in a movie . That pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point . I rented it , and found myself yelling at the TV repeatedly , " no , do n't do that ! " , " why are you so stupid " , " look out ! " , etcetera . A true lack of character development is evident about halfway in . A movie SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them . This one does not . Also , there should have been a longer , more involving end to the movie as well .
0 There 's a good movie lurking here , but this is n't it . The basic idea is good : to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse . But the logic is so muddled that it 's impossible to get involved.<br /><br />For example , our four heroes are ( understandably ) paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that 's wiped out virtually all of mankind . Yet they wear surgical masks some times , not others . Some times they 're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person . Other times , they seem completely unconcerned.<br /><br />Worse , after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill - or - be - killed world , these people constantly behave like total newbs . They do n't bother accumulating proper equipment , or food . They 're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere . They do n't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers . And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race , they 're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes . You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long ... and even if they did , why anyone would want to make a movie about them.<br /><br />So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions , it 's impossible to take their soul - searching seriously . Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense.<br /><br />On top of all this , we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine . His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd , when viewed in isolation . But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note : arrogant and boneheaded . It 's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range.<br /><br />On the positive side , the film * looks * excellent . It 's got an over - sharp , saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale . But that ca n't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper - thin ( and annoying ) characters . Even if you 're a fan of the end - of - the - world genre , you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers .
0 In one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting , it never got there.<br /><br />The people are going from one point to another point , with really no point ( if there was one it was very dull ) . There was no action , suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless , so there was no caring what happened to them.<br /><br />All together the movie was pretty boring.<br /><br />I give it a 3/10.<br /><br />I like that it was n't shaky choppy camera - work and if there was music it did n't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous .
0 while being one of the " stars " of this film does n't necessarily give me sage insight , i do know quite a bit of what was first there ... and what ended up on the screen . i remember seeing the original cut of " incoming freshman " and being very pleased . it was funny , sexy , raunchy , all the main requirements of a drive - in film . you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest ... animal house , porky 's , etc ... so in its own way , this flick was truly ahead of its time . for whatever reasons , the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film , and then edited in ( should i say " shuffled ? " ) THE most random scenes ever . the fat guy , the people with goat heads .... what the heck was all that ? ! i 'm sure it was put in for additional T&A , but it was so slowly paced , it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt . but all in all , it 's a fun memory for me ... especially in that i 'm able to say that the worst movie i 've ever seen ... i'm in !
0 I do n't know where to begin . The cast is full of people who 've never done anything before or since . Debralee Scott is listed on cover boxes , but does not appear in the movie at all . The writing is quite bad , even for college films . It 's obviously very low budget , with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing.<br /><br />The characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy , nerd , suave black guy , tough guys , guy with mustache , attractive girl , small town girl , etc . The featured teacher is about what 's you 'd expect ... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.<br /><br />If you wan't to see a college flick , stay clear from this one . It 's so bad , it 's not even funny .
0 All Hype ! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they ca n't release their film through a mainstream distributor ? Consequently , they do it themselves . Otherwise , the hype of the film does n't justify the content in the film . The story is absent and could easily be a short . The acting is poor , but the animation and music is pretty good . Otherwise do n't waste your time - do n't believe the hype ! However , if you have the chance to see the film for free , do so . Then you wo n't have to waste money . Still , the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self - indulgent mini - series . Otherwise , they 're one hit wonders who never had a hit .
0 I think I should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts . The true test is whether it is good from start to finish , which is the reason I gave the analogical title for this review . Most of us would agree -- even those like me , who enjoy reading many blogs -- that blogs ca n't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons . Likewise , FEM ca n't compare with good film making for a number of reasons , and I actually believe it 's a poor example of independent filmography . From start to finish , FEM feels like a pieced together vlog . ( Heck , even MySpace gets some pimping . ) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 - -I don't -- I'd go watch it . FEM , while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media , is so personal that it is without an interesting story . It 's like watching the mundaneness of life , which I think most would agree is very naturally boring . And yet the creators of FEM want us to applaud it , their very postmodern film about making a film . Cue my yawn.<br /><br />Ultimately , I come away not caring the least bit about any of it . I 'm shocked that I 'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review , even . It 's not that FEM is downright bad , because it is n't ; it has a few moments where I crack a smile or think that maybe -- just maybe -- something of interest is about to happen . It 's rather that it 's just downright ... mediocre . I feel so indifferent about it that it 's almost fitting of an oxymoron : passionate indifference.<br /><br />I hope the creators/"actors " in the film get out of debt from their efforts . They 'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life.<br /><br />See this movie if you 've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do ; otherwise , pass it by , and do n't worry that you 've missed some great , undiscovered talent . You really have n't .
0 Definitely the product of young minds , this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd , who is still trying to find their place in the world , while obsessing over every neurosis . However , I ca n't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel - gazing , trite humor , or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30 . Another problem is that the peripheral characters , whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for , are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect , that they fail to be relatable in any real way . < br /><br />However , one has to give some style points to the filmmakers , who obviously grew up in the video generation , and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non - existent plot . There are 2 points to remember here . First , beware of festival darlings . Second , even though we live in the age of youtube , not everyone 's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment . But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film , and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with , then all the better . Yet I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation , just now coming of age , will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications . In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are , and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure , resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation 's strong point .
0 Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy , reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist , who , both living in the Big Apple , develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site . This in itself is not so unusual , but what is , is their method of communication . Foregoing the verbal , they take to writing notes and later communicating through video.<br /><br />The film is based upon the creator 's ( Arin Crumley & Susan Buice ) own relationship , who besides writing and directing , take to acting as the lead characters as well . With elements of avant - garde , anti - plot , and docudrama , the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self - indulgence.<br /><br />As the movie wears on , a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality . Focusing solely on inner conflict , or the woes of relationship , the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original , nor poignant . This could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict , and a third act , to which there is none - just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere.<br /><br />What is even more aggravating is the film 's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish . This would have been all fine and dandy , but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered.<br /><br />(On a side note , the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack , one of the more interesting aspects of the production.)<br /><br />But as always , watch the film and decide for yourself .
0 At the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 % of IMDb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1 . I can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members . < br /><br />They say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters , those monkeys , just by random proddings at the keyboard , would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare . However , I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time , you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10.<br /><br />I patiently watched the first half , foolishly assuming that the film would , on some level , develop either the plot or the characters , or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought . Failing that , I was quite prepared to accept action , suspense , comedy , horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention . Ultimately , I was disappointed and consequently , much of the second half was viewed at double speed as I searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption . Sadly , there was none.<br /><br />If " The Choke " , was put up against an episode of Scooby Doo then I 'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery , intrigue and unpredictability . And speaking of cartoon characters , the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable ( at best ) and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Bailey 's portrayal of the freaky , death obsessed pseudo goth , London , being so bad I almost felt sorry for her.<br /><br />I would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack , a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock , failed even to entertain , let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick .
