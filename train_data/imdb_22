0 This was a big disappointment for me . I think this is the worst Mastroianni - movie ever made . Cosmatos tries too hard to make this movie a masterpiece and that makes this movie a typical " art "- movie . I give 4/10 for this movie .
0 very badly made film , the action / violence scenes are ridiculous.<br /><br />1 point for the presence of Burton and Mastroianni + 1 point for the real tragic event of the massacre of the innocent italians : 2/10 .
0 This does give away some of the plot , by the way . A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value Christmas and just enjoying the holiday . This , however , does not . It tries to capture the emotion of A Charlie Brown Christmas , there even is another Christmas play , but fails with lackluster and easy jokes . Charlie Brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of Christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for Peggy Jean ( $ 25 gloves ... what ? ) . His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie . Here is one of her jokes : Sally wants to write a letter to Santa , but does n't know how to spell Charlie ( for some reason he needs to be in her letter ) so instead decides to name him Sam , because she knows how to spell Sam . Also , Sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day : " Hark ! " She instead says hockey stick ( har har ) . If Sally saying hark 12 times ( all oddly sounding exactly the same ) does n't kill you , nothing will . Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a large focal point , but that hardly makes it better . Marcy is funny with her responses to Patty , but Patty is another story . She sounds like a boy ( which does n't dispel the rumors ) and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play ( terrible baas and all ) . Apparently she is the sheep every year , and is worried she will forget her lines ( lines she does n't have ) . She is so worried she mentions it twice , one right after the other , and gets the same response . I 'm assuming she must have short term memory loss , or something . Lucy and Linus are more welcome ( although Linus still has annoying advice ) , but hardly amount to much air time . I 'm sure Schroeder is n't even in this one . All in all , it tries to be a parasite to the original , but compromised the message for a few quick laughs .
0 When I noticed that " Hamish Macbeth " was being broadcast in the United States , I was thrilled . I then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing . I adore M. C. Beaton 's books about the wonderful Scottish Constable . The characters in the book are entertaining and very well - written . The powers that be who are responsible for this mish - mash apparently have never have read one of Beaton 's books . Only the name " Hamish Macbeth " has anything to do with the series . Besides the lack of familiar characters , I find the whole show offensively loud . It seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other . If you love M. C. Beaton 's adorable Hamish Macbeth do n't waste your time on this rubbish .
0 I went to see this film based on the review by Siskel and Ebert ; not only did I get duped , but I took some friends along , and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap . After this , I never went to see a movie based solely on Siskel & Ebert 's advice .
0 I 'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how " real " it is . Maybe I 'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything , it 's over the top in a big way.<br /><br />The acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through . That 's not what I call real.<br /><br />It is so earnest in its desire to be " relevant " that it only shows how cut - off from reality Rob Thomas and his staff are.<br /><br />Overall , I found it to be at best a snooze - fest and at worst more than a little annoying . Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress , but it 's hard to tell with the over - the - top style of the whole show .
0 The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.<br /><br />Rather , the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air . This week marked a nadir for Veronica Mars : it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 ( soon to be Big 5 ) . Yes , you read right . Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now - defunct WB and every show on UPN . It was beat by all the shows on Fox and of course by all the shows on ABC , CBS and NBC.<br /><br />Now , the hip hypesters are going to say : but this was a re - run . But everything on TV that week was pretty much a re - run ! It boggles the mind why CW would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from UPN.<br /><br />Clearly something is going on behind the scenes . Favors are being exchanged and influence peddled.<br /><br />Sorry to be so cynical , but what other explanation is there ? The " Veronica Mars has potential " line is clearly dead now that it 's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so.<br /><br />Maybe it 's Joel Silver 's influence and clout , but frankly , I am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching.<br /><br />A great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for CW .
0 Last week , I took a look at the weekly Nielsen ratings , and there was Veronica Mars , supposedly " the best show you 're not watching".<br /><br />Well , they 're right that you 're not watching it . It aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147.<br /><br />Translation : this is the lowest - rated show on any nationally broadcast network ... and deservedly so . I tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a " great " show , a " realistic look " at life and all such nonsense . The reality was otherwise . Veronica Mars is a bore . It 's as unrealistic as it gets , and it richly deserves to be canceled.<br /><br />The only Mystery is why CW felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest - rated show in memory , after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure .
0 I was so disappointed by this show . After hearing and reading all the hoopla about it , how it was a " ground breaking show " and all sorts of wild promises if quality , I tried to watch it.<br /><br />What a letdown ! ! The acting was way forced and exaggerated . The story made very little sense . As for any hint of the vaunted " look into teenagers ' lives " , I could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show.<br /><br />Some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show . The reason is that it 's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is .
0 I give this movie a ONE , for it is truly an awful movie . Sound track of the DVD is so bad , it actually hurts my ear . But the vision , no matter how disjointed , does show something really fancy in the Italian society . I will not go into detail what actually was so shocking , but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal . So for the kink value , i give it one . Otherwise , the video , photography , acting of the adults actors /actresses are simply substandard , a practical jock to people who love foreign movies . Roberto , the main character , has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable.however , the children in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old , and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the Italian life ..
0 Awful ! Absolutely awful ! No plot , no point , no end . It looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch . Every day . I 'm trying to GIVE this video away but no one will take it . I 'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni . Roger , I 'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one.<br /><br / >
0 I like silent films , but this was a little too moronic . As much as I wish I could say that it was worth the hour I stood up I ca n't . I do n't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book . And do n't try it out on kids , they might freak . And the lady who played Pollyanna , how old was she ? 38 ? I know the labor laws were different back then ... BUT COME ON PEOPLE .
0 I could not , for the life of me , follow , figure out or understand the story . As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible . I 'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story / plot problem that never got sorted out . The producers could never separate the many details that the novel , or any novel , has the time and space to create from the other idea , which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer 's pursuit by the police . They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit . Too bad really because they had a solid cast , a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography . In fact , a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours .
0 When we were in junior high school , some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs . It was considered funny then . But the producers , directors and cast of " Semana Santa " ( " Angel of Death " in the DVD section of your local video rental ) are adults and they are STILL setting them off.<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home , I doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes.<br /><br />Mira Sorvino , hot in " Mighty Aphrodite " and other top - rated films , seems to have undersold herself to this project . Her acting is non - existent , confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how " sensitive " she is to the plight of the film 's various victims.<br /><br />But let me warn you -- do not be the next victim ! Step away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf . Tbere are not many good leg shots of Mira ( the only high points I could find in the film ) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality , delivering a mishmash of badly - done dialogue with embarrassing " Spanish " accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production .
0 I saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being Mira Sorvino . With her on the cast it could n't be so bad . And it even seemed like it had some mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in ` Unfaithful ' . The story is set in Spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses.<br /><br />If you 're thinking about the same thing let me warn you : this is a truly awful , uninteresting , boring movie . The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic.<br /><br />The story is contrived with sub - plots that add nothing to the narrative . They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain but fail horribly . The twists have no credibility and the so - called investigation leads nowhere.<br /><br />The characters are paper - thin ! I did n't care about anyone . More than that they 're irritating and pretty hateful people.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious . Mira what is wrong with you ? Why Mira ? You 're an oscar winner ! Keep some dignity ! Her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance . She seems to be sleepwalking all movie long . Come to think of it , I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes . I used to think this woman was sexy . Well she is n't here . If you want to look at some skin try Romi and Michelle because there 's nothing to see here . And that accent ? My god ... <br /><br />Olivier Martinez is even worst . It 's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here . I m sorry but I can´t . I ve suffered enough with this garbage.<br /><br />This whole movie is depressing ! It 's so bad in every way it 's a wonder how it was even made . A lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actor 's name . Do n't fall for it.<br /><br />Avoid it!<br /><br / >
0 It was agonizingly bad movie . It will eat your heart out while you watch it . I beg you : do n't watch this movie ! You will hate you losing 1,5 hours of your lifetime ! It 's not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy ... this movie is boring as ... there is nothing as boring as this movie . You will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end . And you will hate yourself that you did n't listen to me.<br /><br />I hate myself . I tortured myself and I did watch this movie to the end . Now excuse me , I will shot myself . I have seen all.<br /><br />Please . Read this very carefully . Do n't watch this film.<br /><br />Please !
0 I agree with the previous comment , what a disappointment . Rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since Mira and Olivier where in it . I was surprised by their performance , expected more since they 're good actors.<br /><br />Thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse . I even laughed at some bad stunts ! ! when is supposed to be a mystery movie . You can even guess who is the killer beforehand ! ! ! < br /><br />For real what happened ? ? < br /><br />Sorry to say but do n't even bother you 'll waste time and money.<br /><br />Boring ! ! !
0 This may actually be the worst movie that I have ever scene . Incoherent would be a compliment . Even the end made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over . I watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did . By the end of this mess I was sorry any of the characters survived and I was n't feeling too charitable about the actors either . If you want to watch a train wreck , I recommend hanging out at a train station . Even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess . Apparently I have n't vented enough to fill up my prescribed ten lines so , at the risk of redundancy , I will say it one more time . This movie is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating . How about minus zero ?
0 " Semana Santa " or " Angel Of Death " is a very weak movie . Mira Sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people . Mira has an Italian accent which falters from time to time . Could n't she just speak English ? All the other characters have a forced Mexican\English accent which is distracting . The dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden . The cinematography looks nice , but that 's not enough to save this tripe . THIS NEXT PART OF THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS ! ! ! ! < br /><br />During the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away , but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing . That just shows this script has no originality whatsoever . AVOID !
0 Semana Santa is jaw - droppingly bad . It 's so wrong in so many ways I do n't where to begin . So , let 's see ... Mira Sorvino , whose judge husband has been shot while protecting her , goes from Madrid to Seville for her cop job . During the holy week ( Semana santa , see? ... everybody begins to fall sleep .. told u it was bad in so many points , even from the beginning ) , a killer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena . She teams up with male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and nice Feodor Atkine . Soon she discovers she 'll be the next target of the killer ( who wears a red robe ) . Why , oh but why?<br /><br />Why .. ;that 's the questionthat has been in my head the whole movie.<br /><br />Q : Why did go to see that A : Because i love Mira Sorvino ( i even excuse her for that AT FIRST SIGHT crap)<br /><br />Q : Why were we only 8 people in the theater this saturday on the first week end of release ? A : ah - ah - ah . Spider - man got relaesed the same day . But also the fact that the movie has been blast with execrable reviews.<br /><br />Q : Why this movie has been made ? A : Money I guess . But boy did Mira need the money.<br /><br />then ... why ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? first of all , there 's always something wrong with european co - productions . here you got a french - english - german - italian - spanish - danish production . yi - ha.<br /><br />Then it wants to play on the same playgroung as US thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever . Even VALENTINE , though unnecessary and badly scripted and shot , was much better in the suspense and the fun.<br /><br />Then , to give some credit to the story , the screenwriter wanted to add some political sight to the story . Wrong : done in flash - backs in a Traffic - like photography , it 's certainly the most interesting thing i n the movie . Could have stick to it , it would n't have to sit through the whole movie . Better go straight to Guillermo del Tros 's THE DEVIL 'S BACKBONE ( El espinazo del diablo)for some clever fun.<br /><br />Then the homophobia . Bullseye ! The first victims are S&M drug addicted gay twins who got stabbed to death . The annoying olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency held by a badly shaved overweight transvestive with a blond platinum wig . Calls mira Sorvino 's character a big dyke all the time . Do we need this kind of stuff ? Nah . Just needless offensive remarks , just like ol'times.<br /><br />Then the suspense . Yipee . No apparent motive . The first murders are plain illusion as they 're a representation of a famous painting . But no . And the revelation of the killer ( a horrible fascist , of course ) could have been done from the beginning as he appears at the end of the movie as , I guess , it was time for the director to say " weel , time to finish that damn movie . let 's reveal right now who the killer is and why he kills".<br /><br />Then the director thinks he 's a director . Wrong : no sense of suspense , no sense of directing the actors , no knowledge of change of pace . A Giant , mega - bore . The scenes of the holy week are needless ( maybe a co - production rule saying : ok , shoot in Sevilla but show some creditsof this beautiful and historical town with the celebrations of Easter . There we are : a mystery movie for tourists!)<br /><br />Then the actors . All wrongs . Mira Sorvino bores herself to death : she does practicly nothing except getting stabbed in the right hand . Everything she did best ( the Replacement Killers , Mighty Aphrodite ... ) were like they never existed . Olivier Martinez ... hello , anybody here ? When the producers will learn that he 's not an actor but a mannequin with no ability of speech nor feelings ? Feodor Atkine , bland and transparent . Only do we pay great respect to Alida Valli , one of the greatest actress this last century ( and I hope for some more roles in this current one ) . She 's tha main attraction here as she 's the only one to give life to her poor lines . I wo n't mention the other actors as they 're only one - sided characters , uninteresting and shallow.<br /><br />Incoherent direction , inconsistent actors , implausible plot . Idiocy incarnated.<br /><br />Superwonderscope says : 1<br /><br / >
0 with all the European studios involved in this one , you would think you 'd at least get some pretty photography ; but the local color is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent in order to play a Spanish cop - WTF ? The story is hopelessly confused . There 's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or is n't she a lesbian ? - serving no purpose whatsoever . The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time . There seems to be some message about the mid-'30s Spanish Civil War But since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead , one does n't see the point in it.<br /><br />Despite the bull - fighting backdrop of part of the narrative ( which part ? who can tell ) , you never even get a good look at a bull fight . Earnest Hemingway would have punched the director in the nose - with my blessings .
0 I seems in the beginning a interesting film , a Spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays Madrid , but it isn`t none of that , is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film , it can`t be worse in others words , even the presence of a oscar winner ( Mira Sorvino ) isn`t enough to justify the $ 3.00 dollars expended to see this film , the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home , it lead to nowhere and is boring , weak and bad , don`t expend time or money on this film .
0 < br /><br />This movie sucks big time . It reminded me of the movie Resurrection ( Christopher Lambert ) , which i also found extremely boring . And " Semana Santa " is in every way an even poorer movie.<br /><br />Only fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is Alida Valli . Alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history . I loved her maniacal looks in " Suspiria " and " inferno " ( Dario Argento ) . I will not spend more time dealing with this movie . I will say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
0 This film aka " the four hundred blows " is a mistranslation . Faire les 400 coups " means"to live a wild life . As a French , I'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good , but by no means outstanding film . 1.It 's not the first film of the " nouvelle vague " move;check Agnes Varda 's " la pointe courte",(1956)Alain Resnais 's " Hiroshima mon amour"(1958),Claude Chabrol 's " le beau serge"(1958 ) are anterior .Historically,"les 400 coups " comes after . 2.The " nouvelle vague " was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors : Overnight , Julien Duvivier , Henri - George Clouzot , Claude Autant - Lara , Yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion . THis selfishness and this contempt is typically " nouvelle vague".You ' ve never heard ( or read ) the great generation of the thirties ( Renoir , Carné , Grémillon , Duvivier already , Feyder ) laugh at , say , Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder . So , thanks to Truffaut and co , some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties(Duvuvier 's " sous le ciel de Paris",Autant - Lara 's " douce",Yves Allégret 's " une si jolie petite plage " and " manèges").THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler , Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless ! 3."Les 400 coups " is technically rather disappointing : it 's very academic , the story is as linear as it can be , the teachers are caricatures , and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as ( you 've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is ) : Well , your father 's got only his brevet ( junior school diploma)and , as for me , I 've got only my high school diploma!You've got to know , that circa 1960,hardly 10%of the pupils had the HSD in France ! Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!She wants him to have diplomas , who can blame her ? 4.Compared to the innovations of " Hiroshima mon amour",which features a brand new form , and a new " fragmented " content,"les 400 coups " pales into significance . Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior " Jules and Jim " , helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau . 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean - Pierre Léaud , arguably listenable when dubbed in English , is still decent , but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation . 6.The topic = stolen childhood had better days , before ( Julien Duvivier 's " Poil de carotte " , Luis Bunuel 's " los olvidados " ) and will have after ( Maurice Pialat 's " l'enfance nue",Kenneth Loach 's " Kes " ) I do not want to demean Truffaut , his movie is not bad , but , frankly , French movie buffs , prefer " Jules and Jim " " l'enfant sauvage " ( a film honest , true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)"l'argent de poche"(as academic as " 400 coups " but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche " vivement dimanche".<br /><br / >
0 This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads . After all , Feierstein 's Flex Crush will have you know that Real Men do n't watch anything by Truffaut . < br /><br />It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here . The camera - as - voyeur motif was nothing new . Have we all forgotten De Sica 's " Bicycle Thief " ? Or anything by Hitchcock?<br /><br />So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut , who spends all his free time ' screwing up his eyes ' at the movies , who wrecks schoolroom discipline , gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts ) , and ultimately escapes societal confines to make ' his own movie ' . Sorry ... been there , done that too many times for this to matter .
0 This movie bewilders me . It may be that I 'm just a stupid American , but I really just do n't get 400 Blows . Everything I 've read about this movie has been a total rave , but I just could n't stay interested . I 'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film - making as all the critics say , but when it boils right down to it , it 's just really really boring . Maybe it 's the language barrier , may I 'm just not " sensitive " or " artsy " enough , but whatever the case is , I hated this movie . The story itself is n't bad ; it 's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers , and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility . That in itself ought to be interesting , and it was , at first . There was nothing wrong with the dialogue , but then again it 's hard to say because half of the conversations were n't subtitled and for no apparent reason , so I did n't always know what was going on . But for the dialogue we could understand , it made enough sense . The actors were believable enough , but it 's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations . So you feel for the main character , but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think , well that sucks . The plot is n't even your typical plot . Each time he gets in trouble , he gets into more trouble than the last time , but the reasons never vary too much . And through the entire film you realize that there 's nothing the main character can really do about it . So it 's more like just waiting to see how it ends . The ending , by the way , was completely over my head . It 's way too artsy for me , and I just did n't get it . Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow . The structure was certainly there , and it made sense as well , but everything was really drawn out . For the amount of dialogue and significant moments , the movie could have been an hour shorter . It just did n't end . Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots , none of which were especially memorable ; for example , the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds . Now , I 'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere , but for the average viewer , I 'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time . Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running , like doing my laundry , or taking a nap . < br /><br />Final Verdict < br /><br />The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson , if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his   unique decisions . As it was , I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life .
0 My title ought to be enough.<br /><br />It baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence ( Dumas , Flaubert , Balzac , Maupassant ) would churn out such tosh as the " nouvelle vague " cinematic movement . Until the 20th century , France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy . But the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEIRD I CAN BE ! PLOT ? THEME ? PSHAW ! LET 'S FILM AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GOING ROUND & ROUND ! At least this is not as bad as Godard ( who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples ' heads . Oh - la - la , quel artiste . ) . No , Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity . But so does the security camera at a quickie - mart . The two are indistinguishable.<br /><br />Haha , just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds : I bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now . But do n't leave without reading the last sentence of my review.<br /><br />Anyway , if you like French literature , you will HATE this . People who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or maybe " Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " . Or maybe they have read the lyrics to The Doors songs , and they think that 's profoundly moving . Whatever floats yer boat . I find it ironic that this film injects some ( weak ) allusions to Balzac , one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived . Nice try , Truffles . But you 're nowhere near the ballpark.<br /><br />Avoid this film like an aids - infected syringe.<br /><br />If you 're the type of person who likes to think , then stick to Jean Cocteau ( ORPHEE ) , Robert Bresson ( PICKPOCKET ) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa ( IKURU ) , Kobayashi ( KAIDAN ) and Teshigahara ( SUNA NO ONNA).<br /><br />If you 're an idiot , enjoy your Truffaut , Godard , and Andy Worhol . And for pete 's sake push that vein back in your neck . You look like a cabbage .
0 Have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots ? No ? Me , neither . Well , I 've finally seen one in " Spring in my Hometown , " and I must confess , now I KNOW why people do n't do this . The technique is " arty , " to be sure , but it 's definitely NOT ripe for public consumption . The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters , and perhaps that might be the director 's whole intentions . I do n't know , I ca n't read minds , and I certainly do n't know enough about the director to make a judgement.<br /><br />But one thing about this movie that IS painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti - American sentiments . As an American , I 'm well aware of my country 's participation in the Korean War , and I 'm very well aware that we were n't always angels , but I 'll be damn if I 'll take this guy 's version of how things happened . According to this blind fool , Americans were not only at the root of the war , we were the CAUSE of the war , and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country . Whatever , Mister Director . And I suppose you 'd still be making this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we had n't interfered , right ? Talk about forgetting your history . This is almost akin to making the Nazis the " good guys " while turning the Allied forces into the " bad guys . " This movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it 's almost embarrassing to watch . For a man who comes from a country that owes its very EXISTENCE to American interference , he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental .
0 I 'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on Babbage 's difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc .. So , if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film , then I guess I 'd probably be included in that.<br /><br />Maybe I just need to watch it again . A previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired . Maybe that was my mistake.<br /><br />I tried my best to enjoy this film , and there are aspects of it that I do like , but overall I found it amateurish and quite plodding.<br /><br />Being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd , I just ca n't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made , and how the employed graphics reflect that time ( i.e. 1997 ) . Having played games of the era c.f . " Mind Grind " to cite one example , this film can not escape that 16-bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time . Now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least , in favour of actual game play.<br /><br />Having to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel ( as I do n't think it 's ever been aired on UK FTA TV , well not recently anyway ) , I was mildly amused to see the end credits note Gottdog ( God dog ) had 4 people working on it 's design . Maybe it 's mean spirited of me to be amused by this , given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made , nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison.<br /><br />But , as for the main story , I agree that the format is n't the best idea . Like others I agree that Ada deserves a film without the sci - fi angle , and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.<br /><br />There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie . First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real - world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents , seems somehow ludicrous.<br /><br />Also , the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time ( e.g. the winds ) is now known not to be the case.<br /><br />OK , so the Victorians may have held this view , but the 20th century works of Gödel proving that no mathematical system can be complete , Turing 's works on the limits of computability , not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics , have all completely undermined these ideas , which seem central to how the modern day researcher 's software is supposed to work.<br /><br />Finally , the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean " programming " is also just plain wrong , as previously mentioned.<br /><br />This film maybe could have been OK , but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes.<br /><br />I wo n't forget the film though , as like " Pi " , it is clearly a unique work , but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it , 3/10 from me .
0 Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace , Charles Babbage , the history of computers , etc , I was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history . It gives the impression that its writer ( Lynn Hershman - Leeson ) has no real understanding of the Math , technology , or history constituting the film 's subject , but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them . This hits a sore spot with me , as I 've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion , eg : Emmy Coer : " information waves have a half - life " , Ada : " I 'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all".<br /><br />This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms . The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts . It 's more likely , I think , to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic .
0 Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada , I am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film.<br /><br />No one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about Ada Lovelock , her colleagues or the product of her endeavors.<br /><br />Likewise , no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained.<br /><br />As a sci - fi film , this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure . Somehow , the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer -- with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary . I doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd.<br /><br />As a drama film , this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure . Somehow , the writer / director manages to fill eighty - five minutes with constant , unnecessary , annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing . I doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction.<br /><br />I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada . The circumstances under which I saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that I would have otherwise . I am still angry that I wasted the time that it took to see it . Only that I might more effectively criticize this movie , I wish that I were more articulate .
0 If you make it through the opening credits , this may be your type of movie . From the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial . It 's all downhill from there.<br /><br />The lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past , and reconstruct the memories of photographs , to talk history 's overlooked genius , Ada , who conceived the first computer language in the 1800s.<br /><br />The low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting , or even somewhat integral to the script.<br /><br />Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted .
0 Despite some occasionally original touches , like the " virtual sets " that provide the background for the Victorian interiors featuring Ada Lovelace and her circle , this film falls short and ultimately disappoints . Newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented , but is wasted as Emmy , a character who by mid - film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching Lady Ada narrate an autobiography . ' Conceiving Ada ' takes off briefly when Lady Ada ( Tilda Swinton ) appears ; the camera lingers on her facial expressions , mannerisms , even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible , apporting into scenes to dramatize Emmy 's " virtual " rendering of her.<br /><br />A straightforward biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been worthwhile , but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both Lady Ada 's life , and that of a modern - day computer scientist ( and her broadly - drawn , doltish boyfriend ) .
0 This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it 's low budget trappings . The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably . They made good use of the small budget I guess . I just wish the story and most of the acting was better . There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they do n't . Confusing and unbelievable story . Bad DVD transfer too . It does n't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting . This I had to shut off . It was too boring . I can do slow movies . But just make them appealing in some aspect . Visually , story - wise , acting , etc . This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience . Maybe the film maker 's next attempt will be better .
0 Yes , In 35 years of film going I have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies I have seen . Beating ' Good Will Hunting ' Baise Moi ' and ' Flirt ' for sheer awfulness . This is pretentious blige of the first order ... not even entertaining pretentious bilge . The effects are cheap , and worse - pointless.<br /><br />The script seems to have been written by a first year film student who does n't get out much but wants to appear full of portent ! The acting is simply undescribably bad - Tilda Swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable ' intensity ' . Apparently , some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one ... be warned
0 Encompassing virtual reality , the potential of computers , communication with the past , the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society , and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by the fascinating Tilda Swinton , this film should have been great . But it is lousy , terrible if you consider the potential ! The acting - aside from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - veers from tolerable to atrocious . The plot construction is awkward to say the least - the modern day programmer is a dull one - note character , but half the movie is spent setting up her character , and then when Ada finally appears , it is to narrate the events of her life , not to present an engaging story ( Swinton almost pulls this off , though ) . You never fully get to know her as a real person , just an icon from a grad student 's history paper.<br /><br />The digital effects , such as a digital dog and bird , are lousy and distracting , considering it was 1997 and not 1985 . And , finally , the script is just bad . Bad , often pretentious dialog - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend , which made me squirm - cold and distant characters , and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder . The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past ! Astonishing ! But it hardly seems to surprise anyone , and her boyfriend says , " Well , be careful . " ( Although we 're given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous , and it never seems to actually be dangerous.)<br /><br />Also , despite being about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics , it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics OR computers - any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />One scene , towards the end of the movie , is quite good , a monolog by Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life . Poignant , passionate , and insightful , it seems to be dropped in from another movie.<br /><br />So I am disappointed in this movie , because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film . If you find the subject matter interesting , you might want to rent it , but be forewarned . See Orlando for another , much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great Tilda Swinton performance.<br /><br />***spoiler / question : * * < br /><br />At the end of the movie , Ada asks that her memories not be preserved ( in what I thought was the best scene in the movie ) . But then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway , transferring the memories into her little girl ( hence the title of the movie ) . Am I correct , that the programmer violated Ada 's wishes without even struggling over it ? Or is this another confusing plot point that I 'm misinterpreting ?
0 I have n't seen anything this bad since I walked out of the James Bond movie " Moonraker " twenty years ago . I managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of Tilda Swinton , but there was nothing she could do to save this beast.<br /><br />As a cross between " Pi " , " Orlando " , and " Tron " , this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking . The characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy . The plot was wholly unbelievable . The acting was , with the exception of Swinton , amateur . The computer graphics were worse than in " Tron . " Timothy Leary was extremely annoying . I could go on , but what 's the point.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it . I have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud , but she most likely regrets it now.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time on this stinker . There 's nothing worth seeing here .
0 I ca n't believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie . I 'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy , and I can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey . ( See , for example , my glowing review of Altered States [ 1980].)<br /><br />A monkey could have explained better exactly why I should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie . The problem is not that the producers had a low budget -- it 's that they did n't care.<br /><br />Now , to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box:<br /><br />Chicago Tribune < br /><br />San Francisco Chronicle < br /><br />San Francisco Bay Guardian < br /><br />(Actually , I enjoy reading the latter two . Still , their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor . But I know if I ever make a movie with handheld camera , a cheesy plot and stupid effects , I 'll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about Conceiving Ada . )
0 From the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the Fiend . It 's all tiresome , slow moving , unimaginative drivel . It was OK seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around . Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time , but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this . I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic . And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned . Perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone 's pants pocket .
0 " A stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as ' The Fiend ' targets them for death . A pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of ' The Fiend ' and find themselves targets as well . Just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved , you 're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis.<br /><br />Taking " The Hunchback of Notre Dame " to Hollywood , producer Sam Katzman 's lack of studio settings probably helps " A Face in the Fog " look interesting , especially toward the end ( 1930s traffic ) . The direction could be improved upon ; for example , the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful . The budget appears slight . Under the circumstances , most of the silent / talkie crossover cast perform it amiably.<br /><br / > * * * * A Face in the Fog ( 2/1/36 ) Robert F. Hill ~ Lloyd Hughes , June Collyer , Al St. John
0 I normally only write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked . And , as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there , I did n't like it . By now , I assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie , so I 'll skip the summary . Let 's break this down , pros and cons:<br /><br />Cons : The concept : The premise was set up to be interesting . Using Chaos theory as a theme was interesting . However , it was n't carried out so well . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but it seems to me that Chaos theory was kind of misrepresented . The event that occurred in the movie seemed more like contrived coincidence than anything . I guess the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole " God(s ) causes Tsunami to bring back statue . " The presentation comes off as really sloppy though . Some people call this intelligent , but it just seems to be another souped up action film.<br /><br />Storyline : Is it just me , or does it seem that Kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles ? The plot is extremely contrived ; Govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents ( his friend just happens to mix up the vial with a package he was sending to India , a crazy old lady just happens to throw the vial into an idol , half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital , and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that belonged to a famous singer.)<br /><br />CGI : Oh god , the CGI . It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 , and those sucked . Right away , I could tell which parts were animated . Even my ten - year - old cousin knows that underwater cars do n't look like that . < br /><br />Stunts : Yes , I now that action scenes in Tamil movies are n't realistic , but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story.<br /><br />Make up : I have to admit , they did a better job than expected . I thought Kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones , so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me off guard . However , it was still pretty bad , I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks.<br /><br />The songs : The music was distracting and out - of - place in many instances.<br /><br />Asin : Her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie . She was loud , ditsy , and obsessed irrationally about that idol . I actually found myself wishing she would die.<br /><br />Plot holes and Fridge Logic : Let me get this straight : a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a password - locked door , but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus in it . And then , an ex - CIA agent who 's after the vial figures out it 's headed for India . Instead of immediately following it , he marries a pole dancer first . A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available . Furthermore , he gets shot in the throat with a bullet . You 'd think he would be killed , but instead , the magic bullet has cleared his tumor . You read that right , a BULLET knocked out the tumor . < br /><br />Pros ... The Naidu Character : Possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy .
0 Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but I got chance only recently . I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans , what I saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed . I could not understand what was the message except demeaning Hinduism . I am more like many religion type but I felt Kamal Hasan is a man low character to have orchestrated this kind of thought . He could have made a horror movie than this crap . He tried to add Hollywood genre of viruses and god forbid he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world domination . This is a much befitting movie for a film school vs regular public . Shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has . Starting of story tried Chaos to borrow ideas from Butterfly effect , then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism ( Once again I insult Hinduism more but this movie has no equal and my insult is same for religion in general which may have made this movie intellectual one . )
0 The acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg ....... not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong , but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey . In GIRLS ice hockey you can not check . You also do n't BLOCK for someone . Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big . I play hockey and I 'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie . Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters . A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves . Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie . I was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck ....... although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates ..... also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you could n't do in a regular hockey game . She basically tripped the person , which is illigal . Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates . That really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team .
0 I ca n't say this is one of the best films I have ever seen . But then again , I ca n't say it 's one of the worst I have ever seen.<br /><br />OK , so it 's basically a girl does skating , is good at it , wants to go to an expensive school , ca n't afford it and has to take a Hockey Scholarship . She has to hide her skating secret from her friends.<br /><br />Personally , I did n't like the actress playing Katelin . She absolutely could n't cry to save her life , just made wailing sounds , like a toddler pretending to cry to get it 's own way.<br /><br />Katelin was just an annoying person . The way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people . Also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she ' draws the line ' made me cringe.<br /><br />We all knew where it was going to go with her and Spencer . Classically they did n't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical.<br /><br />Overall , I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you do n't mind the main skater being extremely annoying . It 's good to kill time basically .
0 Okay , when I came on the board for this movie , I was really expecting people to be making fun of it . I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it . I enjoyed the movie ... but only b / c me and my little sister ( who is , in fact only 10 ) made fun of the whole thing.<br /><br />I am sorry Jordan , but that acting was awful . You know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead can not act . And it did n't even have a good script or plot to redeem it . I also thought that the character of Pamela was very very lame ... border - lining pathetic.<br /><br />Even with that being said , I thought there were a few good actors , such as gorgeous Spencer , Hollywood , and Ronnie . Still , not enough to redeem the movie.<br /><br />Two things about this movie that I just ca n't get over:<br /><br />1 . ) That that Spencer guy would fall for her . Okay , eww . I looked up the dates and while in reality , he is only about four years older than her , the difference in " Go Figure " seemed much larger . Jordan is a very pretty girl , but in GF , she seemed like 10 or 12 ... she seemed like a little kid ! Jake Abel ( Spencer ) seemed like a college student.<br /><br />2 . ) That there is any way that Kristi Yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl . I mean , I know that Katelin is good and everything , but it still just seemed kinda unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school that did n't even have scholarships for skating , or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such connections.<br /><br />That all being said ... it was n't the worst movie ever known , but it was n't very good even by DCOM standards , which I consider quite low .
0 This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever . The acting was pathetic . Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions . At the beginning of the movie , she was supposed to be discouraged . Instead , she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out . She sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene . I was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses , they had to pluck out her . Everyone else was suffering from over - acting as well . It was flat out annoying . It was also an insult to figure skaters . Jordan took a month to train , and they cast her as a person who makes the Olympic team . It 's practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work . A pitiful excuse for a movie , and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating . Do n't waste your life . It does n't even deserve one star .
0 I personally hated this movie because it was predictable , the characters were stereotypical , and the whole idea was a rip off of " The Cutting Edge " , and " Cadet Kelly " . < br /><br />The main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she does n't belong . The whole place hates her , and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly does n't like her ( well duh the whole damn school ca n't stand you ) . Amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus , gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her . Then comes the choice , where she must choose between figure skating and hockey . She chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationals , and gets to be on the Olympic team . No real surprise there.<br /><br />This whole movie was so damn predictable You knew what was going to happen before you even saw it . This was so awful I nearly puked , and by the time I was finished watching it , I had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap . Do n't watch this unless you are under ten , or actually like crappy tween movies .
0 this movie was a horrible excuse for ... a movie . first of all , the casting could have been better ; Katelyn the main character looked nothing like her TV mom . < br /><br />also , the plot was pathedic . it was extremely cliché and predictable . the ending was very disappointing and cheesy . ( but that s all i 'll say about that ) . < br /><br />the nail in the bag though , was a scene when Katelyn ( jordan hinson ) was supposed to be crying , but the girl could n't cry on command ! there were no tears streaming down her face , just a few unbelievable sobs . she is not a dynamic actress at all . she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie Maguire ( sp ? ) . that s when the movie went from not - so - good , to just plain bad . it really looked like she was acting . < br /><br />in a nutshell : this movie was really bad ! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990 's that everyone 's sick of -- only worse!<br /><br />i give it an ' F ' , because it was just so darn hard to sit through ( b / t / w , i was babysitting when i saw it ) . < br /><br />however , you may like it if your 9 or under . ;)
0 ( NOTE : I thought I 'd be the only one writing what I did below , but I see the others here agree . I guess it was pretty obvious - this was overdoing the bait - the - cat bit . Anyway , here is what I had written:)<br /><br />The owners have left on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat ( Sylvester ) all alone and locked in the house . That means no milk , but the cat , to his relief , does find a bunch of canned tuna . However , to his dismay , he ca n't find the opener.<br /><br />It turns out the little mouse in the house has it ... and baits the cat with it . This is a mean rodent who keeps teasing Sylvester with the opener and then yanking it away at the last second . Sylvester tries everything possible to open the can of tuna but ca n't do it . < br /><br />This is a frustrating story , and why they make the sadistic mouse the " good guy " is beyond me . It 's like some of the Tom & Jerry cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst of it even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict !
0 The opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta . The attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish I had better control of the fast forward control . Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures . This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy . I usually tally a body count , so there was a cat ( which does n't count ) a bum , a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her ( whatever that was about ) and then the plot . Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm , but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly . I liked Warlock , but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off , and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again .
0 I love Julian Sands and will at least attempt to watch anything he 's in , but this movie nearly did me in . I 'm hard pressed to remember when I found any other movie to move .... so ...... slow ......... ly ..... zzzzzzzzzzzz < br /><br />Pop it in the VCR when you 've run out of sleeping pills .
0 The movie opens upon Julian Sands , lying on his back , a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it , about two feet above him . That was so provocative , and I thought , " Here we go ! A good vampire movie ! " < br /><br />And then it died . That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination . It was slow , uneventful drivel thereafter . I was vastly disappointed , as my previous experience with Sands ' acting was quite enjoyable . However , this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Even Julian Sands 's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.<br /><br />It rates a 1.1/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 This is the movie that I use to judge all other bad movies , and so far there has n't been anything close.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say is that after watching this I know that I have seen the worst movie I will ever see .
0 I watch lots of scary movies ( or at least they try to be ) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie I have ever had to make myself try to sit through . I never knew the depths of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive . I am a fan of Julian Sans , but this is worse than I would hope for him.<br /><br />On the other hand the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and I had yet to see what pain looked like first hand . Perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction , but then again I know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me , especially when we had to turn the video off , and that simply is NOT done with our watching ( we had to make one exception obviously ) . < br /><br />If it were up for a remake , I 'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 % of the original incorporated into it . That 's all .
0 " Kids Like These " could have been a decent film , given the subject matter . But instead it has become a below - average , run - of - the - mill TV - movie of the week , with not much going for it . The acting is stale , the plot predictable and the direction non - existent . For a better movie on the same subject , try the excellent " Le Huitième Jour " , a film that really cares about the people with Down - syndrome . In " Kids Like These " they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality . Pretty appalling . 1/10
0 " They Are Among Us " is poor science fiction at best . Mediocre acting bogs down this film . The plot holes are numerous . Aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years , but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human . In their alien form they supposedly have exo - skeletons ( which is why they need the plastic surgery ) but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails . The heroine 's father " disappeared " after Project Blue Book closed , but was supposedly an F-16 pilot . And on and on . If you want to see an alien invasion movie , pick " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " , and see how it is done right .
0 My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitor 's name on the box . This movie is a travesty I hope she negates from her CV.<br /><br />The " plot " was lose and flaccid , the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts . The movie made no sense whatsoever . The rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this , for example , invasion of the body - snatchers and The faculty.<br /><br />If you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie , I suggest you burn it.<br /><br />How it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear , suspense , gore , terror or any of the usual horror film techniques I do n't know , however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand , so you can find parts of it funny .
0 Words fail me.<br /><br />And that is n't common.<br /><br />Done properly this could have been great , funny spoof B - movie sci - fi , but sadly , it was not to be . Rarely in the field of drama have so many competent actors struggled so vainly with such a dogs - breakfast of a script . I can only endorse the previous reviewer 's comments - go clean the bathroom . In fact do ANYTHING except watch this film.<br /><br />Positives : Lucy Beeman 's nose . Negatives : Everything else.<br /><br />Most apposite line : " This is n't going anywhere".<br /><br />If only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate .
0 I ca n't believe how awful this movie turned out to be . I feel magnanimous even referring to it as a " movie " . The acting was flat , the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered . The premise was OK , if unoriginal : a small group of aliens is living in the US and trying to slowly take over humanity . But it goes rapidly downhill from there . How could they convince a " human " to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien - human hybrid they require ? They show a larval alien but never show what it does . They have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale . They throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth . The ending was almost too painful to watch . I suppose that I 'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have anything to do with this . How could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth , " Get away from him you son of a b*tch " with a straight face ? It 's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days . Avoid this at all costs .
0 I am very tolerant of really bad sci / fi and horror movies - I 've been watching them since I was 4 or 5 , so I 've seen some really bad stuff , but I deal with it . I 've even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies so I know not to expect much - a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of . Hope springs eternal , I guess - or the triumph of hope over experience , as they say . Unfortunately , this is a dog right from the beginning and I knew it , but like a moth to the flame , I kept thinking something , anything , interesting would happen . It does n't . All of the actors give a decent performance - given the script , I do n't know how they all kept straight faces . It has something to do with collagen - starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race , one body at a time . There 's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans ... don't worry , he gets what 's coming to him . The slug people themselves do n't really know where they came from , they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth , but ... somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she 's the worm queen and loves her for her self ... oh , must I go on ? Please , I implore you , do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this ... anything would be better ... think of the worst , least enjoyable way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this .
0 No scenario , bad actors ( poor Melissa Gilbert ) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... < br /><br />Give a such budget to make this ... In Belgium , we make ten films which win all prices in Cannes with this.<br /><br />Last time that I 've seen a such NULL - Film was Hypercube . But scenario was better.<br /><br />Is anyone knows if the director was a graduate in school - film or a cop ? < br /><br />The better things in this film was the word " End".<br /><br />Why authorize to sell this ? 1ç is to expensive . < br /><br />I've pay ten dollars to buy this.<br /><br />For me , pay for this was my BIG MISTAKE of millennium.<br /><br />Too bad.<br /><br />Next time I 'll break my arm but buy this type of sh*t .
0 " Bullfighter " was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason . I wonder why ? Could it be : The confusing storyline , the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez , and the annoying editing ? It 's got to be . I think the plot was Mary ( Michelle Forbes ) and Jacque ( Oliver Martinez ) go on a mystical road trip . They meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too . The movie looks great and there is a lot of style , but there is no substance . Most movies , when trying to subtle , do n't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments , and weak special effects.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover : Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most .
0 I did n't know Willem Dafoe was so hard up for bucks that he 'd disgrace himself with such shocking hamming in this monstrosity . Hell : I 'll donate that money that I was going to send to Ethiopia if he 's that desperate . I have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long time ... who paid for this ? They are either pulling some tax scam or insane . A 5-year old would be ashamed of the plot , and I 'd rather get cancer than sit through more than the hour I suffered already . Everybody involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison . Avoid at all costs . I 'd give it minus 10 if possible ... unbelievable .
0 I only rented this movie because of promises of William Dafoe , and Robert Rodriguez . I assumed that upon seeing RR 's name on the cover ( as an actor ) that this movie would be good . It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would of made so if He 's going to lend his name to it , than it has to be good right ? WRONG WRONG WRONG . By far the worst editing since " Manos Hands of fate " . The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wo nt even want to try to follow it anymore . I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this film , maybe they owed somebody , but they are way to good for this . Besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and Rodriguez did n't even talk . So if you wanna see a movie with Poor editing , poor acting , and confusing storyline than be my guest but do n't say you were n't warned .
0 Some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential . But it never comes together as anything more than a student 's graduate thesis in film school.<br /><br />There are two primary reasons for this . Fist , there is not a single likable character , not even a villain we might admire for his / her chutzpah . Secondly , all the acting is awful - even from veteran Willem DaFoe . The ham is so plentiful here , you feel like you 're at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking . Then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up.<br /><br />All right , I 'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as I said , the camera work is quite good.<br /><br />But I feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a " Modern western " , and the DVD packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the film 's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they 're supposed to be making.<br /><br />That betrayal is what hurts ; but even without it , the fact remains that we do n't like these characters , we feel embarrassed for the actors , the story is hopelessly muddled , and in the last analysis , we just do n't care.<br /><br />I took it out of the DVD player about half way through . but the rental store would n't give me my money back.<br /><br />Now , that really hurts .
0 I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery . It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one . Horrible mistake . The box reads like it would be a really good movie . Well , it starts out like it is going to be this great movie . For about 5 minutes , that is . The movie is about a young woman , Laila , who gets killed trying to save her beau , Jack , from a bull . Laila 's dad , Cordobes , is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of . He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull , and goes on this hunt to find him . That was the first 5 minutes that is good . What follows after that is only gon na get 100 times worse . Whoever wrote the script , in my opinion , had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever . Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride . I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character . You know , Jesus ' mother . But , who knows , I could n't make heads or tails of it . As they 're running ... we get to see bad guys , magical visions , ghostly encounters , flashbacks , etc ... And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what 's going on . Needless to say , I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else . It 's horrible I tell ya , horrible . And , there is absolutely no bull - fighting in this movie . Unless you count the first minute of the movie . Hope I helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie .
0 I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT . But this is no SWAT . SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense . Bullfighter had none of these . < br /><br />I should have realized that it could n't possibly be any good , after all , the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a starring role.<br /><br />One poster here called the movie incoherent . Another called it the worst movie ever . Both gave the movie far too much credit . I am so glad I got it from the library for free , yet I still feel ripped off.<br /><br />IMDb needs to include a " 0 " in the " rate this film " vote , just for movies like this one .
0 I began watching this movie with my girl - friend . And after 5 minutes I was alone.<br /><br />I succeed to stay until the end . It has been a painful experience.<br /><br />I liked jean hugues anglade , but I think that he needed to eat , as us , and thus he accepted to play in this movie . < br /><br />There are only 5 characters , and the rest could be called ' art ' or something that I could n't express , but that I did n't understand at all.<br /><br />The only worst movie I saw was crash , but I 'm pretty sure now that I have enough experience to watch it successfully again.<br /><br />good luck ! ! ; o )
0 " Arahan " adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre . To compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chow 's films is a mistake.<br /><br />Firstly the fight scenes are nothing new . All that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang , Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan . Fights in intelligent Motion Pictures need logic . There seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the " Matrix " sequels.<br /><br />The attractive female lead So - Yi Yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in " House Of Flying Daggers " . Having a Martial Arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies . To cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake ( See Aya Ueto in " Asumi " ) unless you are a very talented director which as " Arahan " proves Seung - wan Ryoo is not .
0 This series has its ups and occasional downs , and the latter is the case , here . There 's an agreeable amount of spatter , with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart 's weapons , but the editing film is a seriously disjointed , the film - making itself rougher than usual . At times , the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the " cub , " who nearly gets lost early on . All in all , disappointment.<br /><br />That said , there 's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers . This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy , who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him .
0 This movie is a muddled mish - mash of clichés from recent cinema . There are some promising ideas in there , but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film , what he ended up with was a confusing mess . Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he does n't have much to work with . Furthermore , the movie is largely devoid of scares ( although , in fairness , there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin , diabolical librarians , ghostly love interests , identity confusion , death by savage monkeys , oedipal conflict , abusive stepfathers , sublimated homosexuality , and crime gang connections . The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent . < br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother 's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover , the act itself is never directly portrayed . Instead , director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Avoid this one . For an excellent psychological , ambiguous horror tale , check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters ( 2003 ) .
0 This is the first time I have commented on a film because I felt that if the right person read it , they might wake up and do something about it . Over the last few months , ABC Family began airing a new format of movies . I have seen the last three and enjoyed them . They were engaging and did the trick . My wife likes these films . I was looking forward to viewing " See Jane Date " . The trailers looked and sounded great . Unfortunately , this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project . The year is 2003 , the source ( all bad ) , the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store . It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all . It worked against it . I work in the business of film and television . I enjoy being entertained . This is one instance where I kept thinking could it get any worse . The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you would n't know it from this movie . To add to the overall experience , the end left me shaking my head . An advice to the executives at Disney , ABC , ABC Family and the producers : Under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films . They have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word " contemporary " , " present day " and " current " means when describing a romantic comedy . There is a world passing you by . All in all a huge disappointment from folks at Von Zerneck - Sertner and ABC Family .
0 I have to admit that i liked the first half of Sleepers . It looked good , the acting was even better , the story of childhood , pain and revenge was interesting and moving . A superior hollywood film . But ... No one mentioned this so far ( at least in the latest 20 comments ) , when it came to the courtroom scenes and Brat Pitt´s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends , who are rightly accused of murder , i felt cheated . This movie insulted my intelligence . < br /><br />Warning spoilers!!<br /><br />Why did anyone accept their false alibi , witnessed by the priest ? If these two guys had been with him , why shouldn´t they tell this during the investigation ? Amnesia ? If you were the judge or member of the jury , would you believe it ? Is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away?<br /><br />I am sorry , but in the end , the story is very weak , and this angers me . This movie had great potential . 4/10
0 What is happening to ITV Drama . First , " Losing Gemma " quite simply the worst TV drama I have seen in years , and now " Perfect Parents " a complete shambles from start to finish . Whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should be receiving there P45 by special delivery.<br /><br />In most Drama / Thrillers , a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop , but " Perfect Parents " took this to a new level , I suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense I felt I had been force fed on a lorry load of " Magic mushrooms " , it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create a " Drama by numbers " involving some serious issues - Religion , Education , Greed , Fear , Murder , Paedophillia the only trouble was as The great Eric Morecambe once said when playing a piano , " I 'm playing all the right Notes , just not necessarily in the correct order " . For your next Script guys , I suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than " Script writing For Dummies".<br /><br />Due to the ridiculous Script and the utter lack of Tension in the Direction , the acting was suitably low key , not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch . But I suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the Postman attempts to deliver a script from ITV drama Department , make sure the letterbox is firmly nailed shut ! !
0 what a preposterous story , murder blackmail , child sex allegations , gays and the catholic church ..... absolute tripe . How is it that most UK based TV dramas , sit coms etc have to include the obligortory Gay , its really getting tiresome now . Everybody accepts that there are Gay people in society just has there are other minority groups , but we do n't want it ramming down our throats(i'll pass on this one ) in every single show . Apart from the above , the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime , the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where , oh yes just to be totally PC one of the gay couple was black.i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script .
0 Slither is a horror comedy that does n't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other . It has one scene that is exceptionally good , any number of zingers that work , but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie . In addition , the script does not focus on the hero and heroine , and goes off kilter in several places.<br /><br />A major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero ( Fillion ) to follow Grant Grant ( Michael Rooker ) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster . This whole part of the film drags - Michael Rooker 's character is n't that interesting to us as a person , and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster 's interest might be interesting if this was Grant - Portrait of a Man Turning Into A Monster rather than a horror - comedy alien invasion movie . In the final analysis this movie 's problems are in the script - it is n't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates . The purpose of a horror - comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them , with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens . Instead we get an exploration of the alien 's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag . The ostensible heroine ( Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant ) is more central to this part , but nonetheless I felt the movie had left its narrative track , unless it planned on following Grant Grant all the way to the end.<br /><br />When Fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook , but once again the problem is in the script . By this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that Grant is not just suffering from some disease , and act accordingly ( shotguns ) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that " let us get you to a hospital " is going to help . Although their reactions might have been human and real , these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action . A lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing.<br /><br / > * * * SPOILERS AHEAD * * * After the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack ( a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie ) the script once again betrays the movie . At this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien . The writer - director ( Gunn ) chooses as this character a completely new character , rather than one of already developed minor characters . Why ? Why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot ? By the time this character is attacked , we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her , even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath . Had Gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters , he could have completely avoided introducing her family , and saved time and money . Furthermore , the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien 's plans without all the additional characters , and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.<br /><br />My last criticism is based on the movie 's look . Gunn is primarily a writer , or maybe it was budgetary constraints , but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting . Most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field , and the screen simply looks drab . The sets in Wheelsy ( the fictional town where the action takes place ) look cheap . The whole movie looks cheap . Box Office Mojo states the films ' budget was $ 15 million , newspapers say $ 29 million , and considering they did n't use any name talent , I would say the money did not show up on screen . The monster is just repulsive , and rarely looks deadly.<br /><br />The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character 's actions . By the time Fillion and Co have begun hunting Grant / the alien , one woman has disappeared and Grant is known to have been mutilating animals . At this point I was expecting the FBI or at least the State Police to show up and take over from the hick Sheriff . A woman has disappeared and likely been murdered , and a local has been acting psychotic . Time to call the authorities . But basically I was hoping that would happen because I just wanted some characters who would show up and ACT.<br /><br />Although this movie is ostensibly a horror - comedy , the movie it bears the most resemblance to is Dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions . Whereas Dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story ( especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot ) and particularly the ending , in many ways it was stronger , primarily because the main characters were stronger , but more importantly because it looked beautiful . Although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting I found the look of Slither .
0 Primal Species ( 1996 , Dir . Jonathan Winfrey ) < br /><br />International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs . The army commando team now have to think fast , if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species , instead of the reptiles.<br /><br />You look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film . That is pretty much it . The acting is only just acceptable from a few characters . The story is poor , with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs . This film came out three years after ' Jurassic Park ' . Instead , this film looks to have come out 13 years before ' Jurassic Park ' . The dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made , and i do mean costumes . There are obviously people dressed up , and this film makes no attempts at hiding this . A scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way , in which it looks like someone is riding the creature . The is one good thing , which comes out of this film . The short running time . At only 1 hour and 15 minutes , it does n't waste too much of your life , but still try to avoid it altogether.<br /><br />"It 's like a Friday the 13th Nightmare . " - Officer ( Brian Currie )
0 This is one of the silliest movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch ! I should have expected it , after seeing the first two , but I keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of " Maybe they did it right this time " . Nope - not even close.<br /><br />Where do I begin ? How about with the special effects ... To give you an idea of what passes for SFX in this movie , at one point a soldier is shooting at a " Raptor " as it runs down a hallway . Even with less than a second of screen time , the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around . Bad bad bad bad.<br /><br />How about the acting ? If that 's what you can call it . There is one character who , I suppose , is supposed to be from the south . However , after living in the south for six years now , I have never heard this way of talking . Perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally . I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one.<br /><br />How about the plot ? It 's pretty basic - Raptors escape , people with guns must hunt them down . I 'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels ... would n't they stay outside to hunt prey ? Oh well , at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them.<br /><br />Other things - Let 's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it . Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine ? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it ? How about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - Split up into groups of two . Did n't they ever watch any horror movies ( Or at least an episode of Scooby Doo ) ? In short , this is one of the dumber movies out there . Miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie .
0 This is probably one of the worst " wanna be a low budget hit films " to credit the dinosaur genre . The film is so predictable you could go away , cook yourself dinner , go answer the phone or whatever and when you 're back you 'll know exactly what has happened . The special effects are so poor you would have thought Lego bricks were used and the " super fast " dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator . The acting is over cooked . They try so hard , yet there just is n't enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist ... Yeah okay we know exactly what s going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses . Stereotypical was created for films like this . If you want to watch this film , I suggest you are n't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were . And if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them , do n't watch it , you might break the screen - the facts are that far off .
0 I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons was n't trying to make a serious horror , or even action movie when they made Carnosaur 3 . The movie is flat - out silly from start to finish . Even the humor in C3 is funny because it 's bad . Definitely a high water mark in the ' So Bad it 's Good ' genre . If you enjoy the very worst of the worst , this is for you .
0 Carnosaur 3 is bad ... awfully bad . Bad to the point where it is funny . How matter how much I try to convince myself , I just ca n't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons . I mean , come on , even the cover is bad ! OK , the special effects are absolutely ridiculous . Those " Carnosaurs " are really ridiculous . A scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast , yet when you see them run , they run at the speed of ... an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can . And the explosions are funny(there is no other word to describe it ) . At the beginning , a bullet hits a Jeep AFTER a guys says " What was that ? " ... And the other explosions are also laughable . But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so - called story . You do n't expect a good story(or , I do n't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie ) but at least the story has to try to make sense . I mean , how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent . Incredibly hard if you look at this . Oh , and if you think that it 's easy to makes believable commandos as your characters , tell it to the writers of this awful , awful piece of crap . I mean , what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead ? And they do lots of it . And if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action - packed , WAKE UP ! ! ! This movie is incredibly dull . The carnosaurs(who invented this lame name anyway ? ) attack(in boring action sequences where you do n't see much happening ) . The soldiers think of how to beat them(in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but ca n't seem to convince even just one second ) . So , then , they attack the carnosaurs , but their idea does n't work(another laughable action sequence ) . Back to planning(with a few lame jokes thrown in ) in another ridiculous scene . And this goes on , and on , and on . And let 's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects ... and the story ... Oh OK , this movie simply sucks from A to Z.<br /><br / >
0 Okay , I remember watching the first one , and boy did it suck . After watching it , I just laughed it off and told myself , " oh boy , just another low budget B - movie . I 'll never see a part 2 to this one . " Then , about 1 1/2 years later , there came part two . It sucked even more . But , I just laughed it off again and said , " there 's no way I 'm ever gon na see a part 3 to this one . " Then , about 1/2 a year later , part 3 came out . I was stupid enough to rent it and boy , I just snapped after watching it . God , I never actually realized how much movies can suck these days . Just save yourself $ 7.50 and do n't rent the whole series . Trust me , it 's worth every penny .
0 Carnosaur 3 : Primal Species ( 1996 ) D : Jonathan Winfrey . Scott Valentine , Janet Gunn , Rick Dean , Anthony Peck , Rodger Halston , Terri J. Vaughn , Billy Burnette . Why even bother reviewing this movie ? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal ( and very fake - looking ) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways . The original was bad enough , the sequel was even worse . This falls somewhere in between , though unrelated to either of the previous CARNOSAUR films . RATING : 2 out of 10 . Rated R for graphic violence and gore , grisly images , and profanity .
0 I am Anthony Park , Glenn Park is my father . First off I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one . However the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible . The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park . The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct . My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without any intent to harm her at all . He loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about . The movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form . The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while Sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing . The reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck . My father was a landscaper . The items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work . My recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt , it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie ( at least the Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park portion ) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story . The funny thing is , that if the director would have interviewed any of Sharon 's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what I have posted here .
0 Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the Law and Order ADA 's and her acting is even worse here . Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic . Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child ; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed , as if she ca n't remember where she left her keys.<br /><br />This is an important true story , so it 's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message . The rest of the cast is talented enough , but they just ca n't overcome Rohm 's tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever actual acting is required .
0 The female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre . She was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter . This should have made the police suspect her . I would have been inconsolable in the identical situation . She seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter . It was as if she did not want to even be in the movie . Jennifer Aniston would have played the part better . And it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial , important subject . Everyone else was excellent . I do n't know where the lead actress is but I hope she got some acting lessons .
0 I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for a few years . This movie was way off as far as making it look like Arlington . I saw mountains in the background of one scene ! Texas does n't have mountains . I guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in Texas is filmed in Canada . The accents are also really bad . They should have gotten actors from Texas to play the parts . There a lot of aspiring actors from Texas out in Hollywood . The movie is really sad though , because it is a true story . I pray that the killer is found and convicted . The one good thing is that bc of her death , we now have the Amber Alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted .
0 I think that Elisabeth Rohm , though she may try hard , is not very good at all . I guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price . I mainly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick , whose work I know very well.<br /><br />He was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch . When he was n't on the screen , the thing went dead . This was filmed in Vancouver . He gave me the creeps , but be assured that in real life he is a kind , funny compassionate man . He even said playing that role gave him the creeps.<br /><br />I'll watch anything with him in it , but Elisabeth Rohm - never again . She was as exciting as lint on Law and Order . Maybe a very nice person , but no actress .
0 If there was a ZERO rating , I would give it to this movie . Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still could n't make it through from beginning to end . I ca n't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise ! The acting is atrocious all around , the script is blah , the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when she 's being threatened . The " southern " accent from the actress playing Amber 's mom is laughable - I 'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY talks like that ! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene . The subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment .
0 Everyone involved ( and the audience ) should seek out " The Candidate " to see how good this movie could have been . What happened the South American story ? What were Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut - outs . Up to now I have liked every Gene Hackman performance and/or movie . He was either disinterested ( which I can hardly believe ) or dreadfully miscast . I have also liked and defended Richard Gere ( and been vilified for it ) . But here he had no " power " . He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive . All in all I was very disappointed . I really expected much more from this director and cast . If you ca n't find " The Candidate " watch " Wag the dog " again or even " Bulworth " .
0 The main problem with " Power " is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever . It gets boring after awhile , sitting around waiting through scenes that do n't connect to find something that drives the movie forward . You could probably pass it all off as character development , but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie , or are just simply to flat and uninteresting . Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom . He should have cut a few of the characters ( hackman , the wife ) and concentrated harder on others ( Billings ) . It could have been a great , hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting , a fact that amazed me considering the cast . Even Gene Hackman performance was n't up to par . Denzel Washington is the only real actor of note here . Gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere . < br /><br />Sidney Lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies ( i.e , Serpico ) and stop trying to recapture his success with " 12 Angry Men " and " Fail Safe " . It has n't worked yet Sidney , and it most likely never will . leave the ensemble dramas to Altman . < br /><br />3/10<br /><br / > * / * * * *
0 If the only sex you 've ever had is with a farm animal , then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading.<br /><br />This is by far one of the most boring movies I 've had the pleasure to try and watch lately . I found the DVD lying around at my friend 's house , and I made the sad mistake of not burning it.<br /><br />I am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie . Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c - span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c - span.<br /><br />I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie , but I was unable to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere .
0 When anti - bush jokes get really easy to do , a show like this had better make sure it has something extra . When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they do n't have yet , it 's just plain nonsense . Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly . There 's also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who is n't really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all . The democratic characters rarely give their names so it 's a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton.<br /><br />The episodes have coherent stories but that 's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking .
0 I am marking this as a " spoiler " only because of some of my comments of the show 's content , not to the content itself.<br /><br />As I read the comments it is apparent that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show , but disdain it , while the Democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness . One reader even ( so it seems ) actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when Bush was in grade school.<br /><br />But as to the content as I see it , trying to be neutral , is that the group that made this series must actually be really Bush haters . In the Episode that I saw last , s02e03 , it showed that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the front runner for the nomination ; because , the other former front runners are all featured.<br /><br />Another thing that caught my attention , was the use of add in closets . I thought that the series must have been made in Europe of for sure not in the U.S.A. , because I know of no home the U.S.A. that does not have built in closets , and most likely in the homes of the artists.<br /><br />As I watch the show , yes I do get caught up in it , I am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our President . Sure there are problems as most American will agree , but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world . Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network , so that IF Obama or Hillary got in , would they continue to produce and air the same sort of " humor " about them?<br /><br />Just one more comment on a commentator 's remarks . IF there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000 , according to that writer , he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president . Wow , wishful thinking on his part . As far as 911 events , I do believe that it was set in motion back when Clinton was president , and I ca n't see how if Gore was president anything would be much different .
0 Honestly , my expectations for Little Bush were low . I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun ( but rehashed and overdone ) Bush jokes . Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more.<br /><br />The writing was absolutely pathetic . Aside from the Cheney - Chicken - Eating joke , and some giggly - little swipes , it was really boring and unfunny.<br /><br />The animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen - year old 's Flash Project . It 's disgraceful that they used Macromedia 's product for this , because it 's capable of so much more.<br /><br />I do n't like Bush that much , and I enjoy a Bush - joke as much as the next guy , but this was just a half - hour swipe at the President with several painfully un - funny moments . Trey Parker and Matt Stone did so much more with That 's My Bush.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor , skip " Lil ' Bush " and go buy a copy of the short - lived comedy " That 's My Bush " . You 'll thank me .
0 Abysmal with a capital " A " . This has got to be one of , if not THE , unfunniest show on TV right now . I 'm about as anti - bush as it gets , but this show does n't even get a chuckle out of me . What you think of Bush as a president has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether or not you 'll like this piece of crap show . The " jokes " are not funny at all . For example , in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head : " Welcome to camp al - qa - eeda ! " . There is NOTHING funny about that . Is it even supposed to be joke ? The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show , hyping it up , were funnier than the show itself , and that 's just sad . Hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season . It should n't even have had a first .
0 This show is not clever . That 's basically what it boils down to . The " original humor " that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny . In another comment , someone quotes a couple hilarious lines . The standout for me was George H.W. Bush telling the kids they 're not supposed to watch any TV besides Fox News . Wow . I thought the episodes I saw were bad . The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic.<br /><br />My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season . I 'm a liberal republican and I know Bush has n't been a good president . We all do . But that 's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time . I place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind ' Meet the Spartans ' . Their formula , bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit.<br /><br />Again , just plain bad . Unfunny , and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed , but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons . Please do n't watch this crap , unless you 're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush and dumb is comedic gold . < br /><br />Oh , and the voice of Bush sucks . All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent , and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences . At least South Park admits the voices are n't accurate . If you want funny political satire , watch Daily Show / Colbert . Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken , which is fun to watch , since the stop motion action figure animation is EXTREMELY well done . Look for the George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube . Priceless
0 I want to start by stating I am a republican , even though I do n't agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office . And I love the daily show and Colbert report . They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV . I enjoy the bush jokes on Conan , Letterman , Leno , because I admit that W is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth(I do believe he 's not the dumbest either . ) But it comes to a point when enough is enough and it 's not really that funny anymore . I see where it can be funny and it is(hey he 's making fun of our authority figure he 's hilarious . ) . Comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him . I mean maybe one special episode , but an entire series is just dumb . It seems CC is just saying the same bush jokes that we 've heard WAY to many times . I really can not see this show going past 1 season .
0 Lil Bush is a 30 minute cartoon show comprised of 2 15 minutes episodes shown on Comedy Central . It takes place in a fictional , cartoonish Washington D.C. , and centers around the satirical , childish representations of George W. Bush , Condoleeza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney . Other politicians are also satirized in the same manner , and act as minor characters.<br /><br />The pilot of little Bush , much to this commentator 's expectations , proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production , which barely delivers on its featured promise : a satirical look at the current presidential administration . While one must admit that premise of the show does have SOME merit , even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired , execution that can only be described as sloppy at best , and downright awful at worst , has marred what little potential the show had.<br /><br />Lil Bush , which may be technically classified as " satire " , tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar ( but not particularly original , entertaining , or funny ) ways . The show 's consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording Bush / Cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television . As such , most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clichés , some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already . Comparing the Vice President to Darth Vader , for example , may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the Daily Show / Colbert Report / Letterman / Conan O'Brien / Leno monologue / any late - night - talk - show - ever , but it is not funny here . As if that were not enough , the show 's plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old , tiresome Bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program.<br /><br />In the show 's defense , when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke ( which seems to be a rarity ) it is often somewhat humorous . If the show were to expand its depth somewhat , and place its characters into new situations , exotic situations , rather than the same old mistakes and " quagmires " perpetuated by the Bush administration , therefore not having to rely on the same old Bush jokes over and over again , the show might be considered somewhat tolerable , and possibly even innovative.<br /><br />Ultimately , it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the Lil Bush series the most damage ; its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality , or its painfully narrow minded ambitions . It is reasonable to expect that Lil Bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans , that is , if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing ; so long as the program continues to lampoon the Bush administration thoroughly . Even so , the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is , a weak and pointlessly vulgar attempt at satire , and tune out in search of something more intellectually stimulation ; The Price is Right , perhaps .
0 I just finished watching this film and WOW was that bad . Actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY bad it was kind of entertaining . The action of the characters is hilarious , from the hyper - dramatic way they fall to gunfire , to their incredibly bad acting ( were the bad guys all just pulled off the street , or were they actually actors ? ) , to incredibly bad delivery of lines , to their inexplicable actions ( if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter , obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob ! ! ) . This film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines.<br /><br />The camera work was also really bad - you can hardly see what 's going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness.<br /><br />I would have voted " 1 " except that I do like Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi , and I was entertained by a couple of scenes : 1 ) breaking of a villain 's arm so the bone pops out of the skin ( that 's got ta hurt ) 2 ) a drug kingpin eating a brown - furred animal ( a monkey ? ? ) by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3 ) Sonny Chiba 's performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers.<br /><br />I am actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba but this one is really not worth anyone 's time . I 've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching ( and they are great ! ) are the Street Fighter series , and The Killing Machine . I 've also heard the Executioner and Golgo 13 are good . I recommend sticking to those ones .
0 This is easily one of the worst martial arts films I 've ever seen , and that 's saying something . The chant of viva Chiba , viva Chiba is heard at the title , soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid , stupid . The basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into Japan and one man vowels to stop them , of course that 's our man Sonny Chiba . The Karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords . A woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard , but what are her true intentions ? Let me say at this point who cares ? Soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment . Sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills , end of story . Oh yeah the woman was corrupt too . Congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever.<br /><br />As stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films I have ever seen . What makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be . Some have already mentioned the infamous American intro put into the film . That 's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it 's beyond funny . I would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70 's karate scene was at the time . Watch as Aaron Banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student ( bad editing ) punching him in the throat . But everything is badly done in this film . Terrible unbelievable fights , fake I mean fake blood , bad acting , dubbing , wardrobe , and let 's not forget the story . One man to take out an entire drug problem in a country ? I bet . Fight after fight is laughable . This was the 70 's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight , but Chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie . Let 's see he kicks a gun in half , kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene , give me a break . Not to mention the fact that it 's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it 's filmed so poorly . One part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture . OK . As the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood , really fake blood . Too say it looked poorly made is and understatement . The acting is totally non existent in this film . I do n't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good , but it was n't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor . Was it my imagination or did they dub the Asian go go dancer with a black accent ? As expected from a 70 's wardrobe you 'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks . Also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time ? Do n't try and hide it now . The characters were stupid as well . The pimp club owner 's one of whom is decked out in a Japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie . Also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling . It was very annoying.<br /><br />Overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making . That does n't mean that it 's not entertaining . With a film made so poorly it 's hard not to laugh through most of this film , if you can stomach it . This was an old favorite watch with my best friend . If it was purely bad I would give one star , but the laughs it delivers bumps it up . 4 out 10 .
0 After watching " The Bodyguard " last night , I felt compelled to write a review of it.<br /><br />This could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera - work . It was beyond annoying . The angles were all wrong , it was impossible to see anything , especially during the fight sequences . The closeups were even horrible.<br /><br />The story has Sonny Chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring . He is approached by Judy Lee , who is never quite straight with Chiba . Lee 's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought , as the Mob and another gang of thugs are after her.<br /><br />The story was decent , and despite horrible dubbing , this could have been a good movie . Given better direction and editing , I 'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie . As it is , it 's more like another cheesy 70 's action movie.<br /><br />Note : The opening sequence has a quote familiar to " Pulp Fiction " fans , and then continues to a karate school in Times Square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Rating : 4 out of 10
0 I liked Chiba in Street Fighter , and I figured hey , no matter how stupid this movie will be , I 'll at least get to see him kick some ass , right ? Wrong . This is a dull , dreary mess of pointless talking , half - assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming . There are few action scenes of any kind , even fewer martial arts scenes , and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you ca n't even make out what in the world is going on . The dub is also atrocious , and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the Italian Mafia ... EXCEPT THEY'RE ALL Japanese ! Avoid like the plague -- you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes .
0 Avoid the USA version . It is with added US footage and the worst dubbing you 've ever heard probably done by New York amateurs . The dubbing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I think a black guy from the Bronx does Chiba 's voice . I could n't watch the entire film it was that bad . Instead of this Americanized version watch Chiba 's other greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors .
0 The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba , this movie gives you lots of him . Chiba makes speeches ; Chiba poses ; Chiba sneers ; Chiba glares at the camera ; Chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys ; Chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful / pensive ; Chiba drives his car ... <br /><br />I enjoy Chiba as an actor and a martial artist ... but even for a Chiba fan , this movie may have a little too much Sonny Chiba . It 's obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him . And no , I would n't put " Street Fighter " in the same category , because in " SF " he plays a ruthless , amoral anti - hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes . Here , he 's front and center almost all the time , and he tries to be Batman , Captain America and Bruce Lee rolled into one . Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could n't pull this off for the length of an entire feature film , and Sonny just kind of wears out his welcome . At least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while.<br /><br />The movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence ( apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the American version ) and a goofy cheer " ( " Viva ! ! Chiba ! ! Viva ! ! Chiba ! ! ) that starts things on the wrong foot . There is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing - Sonny ( or his usual English stand - in ) apparently could n't be bothered to do the vocals for the American version , so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from " Street Fighter " . < br /><br />Even with all those flaws and the overexposure , this could still be a minor classic , but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy . I 'm willing to believe that Karate actually works if someone as amazing as Chiba 's character is supposed to be does it , but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you ca n't really see what 's going on most of the time . It 's not all bad : there are some decent shots and compositions , and there 's at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the client 's bedroom in a genuinely inventive way . < br /><br />And as for the actual plot ... forget it . For a " bodyguard " , Chiba 's character is something of an idiot . The screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him ( and his " client " ) in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them , and after 30 minutes , it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good . ( Also , If his character was really out to destroy the Japanese drug trade , he 'd have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets ... and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided . ) < br /><br />Still , as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel . It 's still Sonny Chiba , and he 's still fun to watch . I paid a buck to get this off the bargain DVD rack at a local mega mart , and I feel it was worth watching once .
0 The first few minutes of " The Bodyguard " do have a campy charm : it opens with crawling text from the Bible ( the part that Samuel Jackson recites to his soon - to - be victims in " Pulp Fiction " ) , continues with two karate school teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of mankind ( who is better ? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee ? ) , and then Chiba appears , playing himself ; he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand . Unfortunately , any entertainment value , intentional or unintentional , soon gets crushed by the disjointed story , the lack of action for long periods of time , and the poor quality of any present action . To keep it simple , here 's why " The Bodyguard " is an unbearable movie to watch:<br /><br />1 ) You do n't know what 's going on . < br /><br />2 ) There are barely any fights . < br /><br />3 ) The fights that are there , are short and terribly filmed.<br /><br />Sonny Chiba is cool . Judy Lee is gorgeous , her face is glorious . It 's only for them that I give " The Bodyguard " a 2nd star out of 10 . This movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours .
0 Before I begin , you need to know that I am a huge fan of many of Sonny Chiba 's films . His biographical series of the life of his master , Mas Oyama , were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made , as were most of his Street Fighter films . The action was practically non - stop and with the possible exception of Bruce Lee ( depending on who you ask ) , he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s . Because they are so good , I 've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more ( which I am in the process of watching).<br /><br />Unfortunately , despite my love of these films , I am NOT a mind - numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that I rate EVERY film a 10 . There are a few reviews like this here on IMDb and I truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and is n't even close to the being Chiba 's best work . A score of 10 is n't a real rating -- it 's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about Chiba , not this film ! As I said , technically this film is awful . Some of this was the result of my seeing the American dubbed version , with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing . But most of the problem would still exist with the original Japanese print . The camera - work is simply atrocious -- like it was done by chimps ( smart chimps , but still chimps nonetheless ) . Often , much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production . And , again and again , the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched -- with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly.<br /><br />I do n't know whether the musical score is original or not -- but it was also very , very bad . Sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with Ennio Morricone 's " Spaghetti Western " music -- it was annoying , distracting and just plain silly.<br /><br />As for the martial arts action , I think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit . Instead of the great fight scenes you 'd look forward to in a Chiba film , the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera ! ! So what you are left with is the story ... and this MIGHT just be the worst part of the film ! It 's supposed to be an anti - drug film starring Sonny Chiba as .... Sonny Chiba ! And when the film begins , he vows to destroy the drug trade in Japan . But , the Mafia ( complete with not a single member who looks Italian , but who are ALL Japanese ) vows to stop Chiba . And , when a lady comes to Chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade , he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions -- even though she 's NEVER forthright about telling him what she knows ! In fact , later it turns out she is just trying to use Chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine -- and he CONTINUES trying to protect her ! ! This makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script -- such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had Chiba walking about as if he was drunk.<br /><br />So if it was THAT bad , why still does it merit a 3 ? Well , first , there are many more horrid marital arts films ( such as many of those from Hong Kong in the 1970s)--including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting ( now THAT 'S bad ) . Second , while the action is very bad compared to other Sonny Chiba films , compared to its contemporaries , it 's not that bad . Still , you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film.<br /><br />By the way , if you are wondering if this is the worst Sonny Chiba film , it certainly is not ! In one of his first films , INVASION OF THE NEPTUNE MEN , Chiba plays a leotard - wearing super - hero who battles pointy - headed invaders from the planet Neptune . It 's so bad that it rivals PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and THEY SAVED HITLER 'S BRAIN for awfulness.<br /><br />A final note to parents -- Like most of Sonny Chiba 's films , this one is very violent and has its share of boobies . DON'T let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg ! Make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated - R martial arts films !
0 Most action films are crass of Hindi cinema , especially of Sunny and his family < br /><br />The film is typical Sunny type with bashes , big dialogues and melodrama < br /><br />The film also has typical Rajiv Rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villain < br /><br />The starting is okay and then the shift to Kenya is good but then the film goes on and on < br /><br />The sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happens < br /><br />They are many stupid scenes like the Kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially Sharat < br /><br />The climax too is prolonged < br /><br />Rajiv Rai does an okay job Music is okay , only 1 song works and that is the last TOOFAN Camera - work is good < br /><br />Sunny Deol is as usual , Chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable , Naseer is alright heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri is not even half as scary as he was in TRIDEV the rest are okay
0 I watched this movie on march 21 this year . Must say disappointment . But much better than " Tridev".Plot is hackneyed . Tells about Prabhat who lives with his father , Wife and his little brother . The movie opens when he saves a bride . Anyway . Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother . He makes a plan by sending few man . They come to a school pretended to be Prabhats friends . Kill that kid . His father throws him out of the house . Then later comes back . He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him . Sunny gives a good performance , Chunky was annoying at best , Naseerdun is wasted . Divya did good , Sonam was wasted , Jyotsna was wasted but looked cute . The kid which played Sunnys brother in the movie was cute . Too sad he had to get his character killed . The girl was cute but was annoying . The other kid did good . Alok did good . Kiran was adequate . Amrish and Gulshan did good . The cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya . Script is weak but has a few good dialogs . Also drags .The movie . The music was alright . I only liked one song"Saat Samundar " the lyrics of that song was good . The other songs were forgettable . Don't watch this . Rating-3/10
0 Imagine that in adapting a James Bond novel into a movie , the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid - friendly . Or if a television producer told Chris Rock he could n't cuss so that his specials could be rated PG . In the same way , the director of the movie " Something Wicked This Way Comes " took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . This created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . In trying to make the story of " Something Wicked This Way Comes " easier for children to follow , the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone , and good always prevailing over evil . This is apparent in Will 's character transformation , Charles Halloway 's rescue of Jim , and the carnival 's defeat.<br /><br />Will 's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . The scene in which the Dust Witch visits Will 's house in a balloon has been cut from the film . Instead , a green mist follows Jim and Will home and gives them the same bad dream about the Witch and her spiders . The balloon attack shows us that Will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . He gets on top of a neighbor 's roof and tears the balloon with a bow , defeating the Witch . " Sorry , Dad , he thought , and sat up , smiling . This time it 's me out , alone , " Will decides as he prepares to face her ( 147 . ) Removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that Will is becoming more adventuresome . The film shows us many examples of Will being afraid to follow Jim , but never growing curious like his friend . In the book , Will has both a good , quiet side and an " evil , " daring side like his Jim . In the movie , each boy only has one mode of thought , which destroys Bradbury 's theme of both good and evil being present in each person.<br /><br />In the book , Will saves Jim because of their friendship , but , in the movie , Charles Halloway saves Jim to repay Jim 's father . Will pulls Jim off the carousel in Bradbury 's novel because he does n't want his best friend to grow up without him . It is the good in Will , the fact that he cares about his friend , that saves Jim from the evil curse of the carnival . On the carousel , Jim " gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind , the one part of him , the small , white , separate part that still remembered their friendship " ( 269 . ) This shows that there was good left inside of Jim , which has the potential to still defeat evil . But when Charles Halloway saves Jim in the movie , he does it to repay the debt he owes Jim 's father , who saved Will when he was a little boy . By changing the motivation for saving Jim , the filmmakers have ruined Bradbury 's original idea that it takes good to win against evil.<br /><br />In the end of the movie , the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . When the book ends , Mr. Dark turns himself into a little boy and Charles Halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he ca n't stand it and evaporates . In Bradbury 's world , evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . His message is that good will always prevail over evil , but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly . " Good to evil seems evil , " says Charles Halloway as he holds the dying Mr. Dark . " So I will do only good to you , Jed . I 'll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself " ( 275 . ) In the movie , Mr. Dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it , and he dies . By eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles , the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil , as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . This takes away the major theme of Bradbury 's book , which is that doing " good " toward others wards off evil.<br /><br />Good may always triumph over evil , but trying to make movies more kid - friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . In the movie , " Something Wicked This Way Comes , " Will does not transform , Will 's friendship does not save Jim , and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . As a result , the filmmakers have left out too many of Bradbury 's main points . The process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . In the case of this story , Bradbury 's frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer , simpler version of itself .
0 First and foremost , I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury . It 's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later . It was one of his best books , with , you know , Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine . I as just hoping that this movie would be all right . It had lots of chances , with a great cast , like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce . And Bradbury even wrote the script himself . And on top of all that , it has PAM GRIER!<br /><br />How could it fail?<br /><br />There may be spoilers within.<br /><br />First of all , it was dumbed down . Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum . All the visuals from the book ... gone . Everything that made you squirm ... gone.<br /><br />And then there 's the acting . Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s , the kids in this movie can not act . And , this bugged me a lot , neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 . Their strong friendship was n't addressed . It was more like they were acquaintaces . < br /><br />You'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark . But here it 's like they just do n't care . All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something . This is far from being some of their best performances . < br /><br />Pam Grier was fine as the witch , but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself was n't well pulled off . She 's a lot less evil and does n't have the presence as she did in the book . < br /><br />And everything that was left out of the book . The ballon night chase , the marking of Jim 's house , the real death of Mr. Dark , what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry - go - round , the fate of the lightening rod salesman , the real death of the witch , and oh so much more . < br /><br />And the special effects were bad , even for the 80s . The merry - go - round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around was n't really creepy , and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything . < br /><br />I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel , but it makes blood boil . Do n't see this movie but read the book . It 's a classic of Bradbury .
0 I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I 've gathered , it will be interesting ( when I finally do read it and I will ) . My comments will be based purely on the film . As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did , I was so disappointed it hurt . This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish . The actors were not well cast ( though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here ) . The kid actors , it seemed , were merely asked to show up , get in the characters ' clothes , say the lines and make the faces . The set and props were cheap and unrealistic . The direction was surprisingly bad . I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it , just to see the kind of work he had done . The editing was cut and paste and the plot ( screenplay ) was just that as well ( even though the author had been involved himself , irony ? ) . The building up of the tension , fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came.<br /><br />I've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it . What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing . It had so much potential . Unfortunately , the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story .
0 This sports a nice , deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk . The first third of this movie was nothing but talk , and more talk . Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other . < br /><br />The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it 's really a " chick flick " and little else . This probably plays on the Lifetime network.<br /><br />There was a quick murder scene and then more talk . By halfway through , they had lost me . < br /><br />By the way , Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here .
0 This TV - made thriller is all talk , little action . It works hard to set up its convoluted plot , yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best . By the end , I knew no more about these characters than I did at the beginning . It has a quasi-"Ten Little Indians " scenario , but ditches it mid - way through in favor of spotlighting Sally Field and her uncovering of a killer . Field overacts here with a gracelessness I 've seldom seen from her . The early introductions are good , but the writing quickly strays off - course and eventually goes over the top . Lots of hysteria , and constant thunder and lightning effects ( which adds nothing ) . A curious failure from producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg . With all this talent , could n't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and Sally Field hiding in a closet ?
0 This is a low budget Roger Corman horror / creature flick . A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok . An engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping . None of the characters have any depth , but then they are not the focal point . We only get a few glimpses of the huge two - legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best " kill " scenes in a small budget film.<br /><br />My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself . Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet . With no real stand out roles : Jane Longendecker , Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier . Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor . I was most impressed with the alluring Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming as a crock of pickles .
0 This is just a joke of a movie , they lost me already at the opening scene ( Spoilerwarning ) dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage , this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does , well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out , omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on that s the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish ... Pretty useless and even more dumber . And i will not even talk about the cast because they are n't worth the effort . why they did n't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me ..... And this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie . Only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low - budget movies.<br /><br />If these kinda things do n't bother you go see it , but be warned if your IQ is above 60 you will probably hate it .
0 Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water ... <br /><br />Another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat , let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science . Gereco Biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research , accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate.<br /><br />B - movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill " genetic mistake monster movie " . Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee , Aussie accent , hat , big ass knife , the works , as a croc specialist hired by Gereco executive Joanna Pacula( .. wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people ) . Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter , who works at the animal shelter . Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker 's love interest , a local artist who welds sculptures( .. his brother is a victim of the croc ) . Of course , this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc , hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.<br /><br />The croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food , the special effects of a low grade variety . In regards to Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade dino - monsters , I stick with Carnosaur . The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it 's hind legs , often upright as it pursues potential victims . I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing Crocodile Dundee with his croc hunter , and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails . Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen . As expected , Pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion( .. gulp ) .
0 What an awful movie . I love monster flicks but I could n't watch even half of the terrible acting , cardboard characters and abysmal special effects . There is nothing redeeming about this movie . The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous , uninspiring sock puppets . The plot is formulaic , cut and paste , standard science - run - amok drivel . Even the CGI is horrible . You know it 's bad when you ca n't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy . No surprises here , just same old same old . This is truly one of the worst films ever made . Director Roger Corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata .
0 the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists . it should actually be called dino crap.<br /><br />there is nothing good about this movie .. even the actors are not worth a penny . do n't waste your time watching this movie . the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie . i mean is n't he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie ? the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut - and - paste stuff . and its the same old story . man plays god . creates some creature . it escapes and is happy eating people . and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it . bla bla .. u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
0 This is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies I have ever seen . It follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes . The monster looks way to much like a dinosaur , having big Tyranosaurous - like hind legs , when it should just look like an over - sized crocodile . Everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes " cliche " , minute after minute . Why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate ? Plus , there 's always a guy and girl who share a lame , obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations . To much has already been said by me and I feel as if I 'm wasting my time writing this ...
0 There are some things I can never understand . Such as this movie . What if I were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing ? How can anyone even believe that an utterly fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place , would influence the events in this movie ? I know that its B - grade , low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through . It just does'nt make sense . Are people really so stupid that they would sit through this ? Apparently so . For laughs ? No , this thing is n't even worth laughing at .
0 A large part of the scenes should be cut off . There is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off . For example the scene where the hunters mentions " I got spiders on my dick " , " I like dick " , playing in the mud scene , or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmer.<br /><br />How about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman , Diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears women 's panties three sizes too small . While they make love , did n't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head ? Why did they do in a living room ? I mean his head really flipped . How about the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg 's Jaws scene at Grant Lake . All these strange scene could easily be re - dubbed and billed as a comedy.<br /><br />Here in my local town , the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about Dinocroc , and I am glad I did n't watch it because I later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled . The movie was THAT bad . I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview . It features the leg of Dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old . It could easily passed over as Baby Geniuses.<br /><br />If any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash . Such as Diane 's boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer . When this happens , who cares about Dinocroc ? The panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of Dinocroc . His acting was so bad , he makes a much better replacement for Mr. Bean . MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON , here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci - fi flick . Perhaps the worse casting in the history of Hollywood .
0 Now I myself am a lover of the B movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end . First of all the movie is starring Lizzy McGuire 's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog . Now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three - legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please I ask you ? And heres another point for pondering , why do they show the Dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water ? I believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall , that was a heart breaker . But redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death . But the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil E.V.I.L Corporation . And let 's not forget the characters let 's see we have jerk off # 1 as the male lead and half way decent chick ( who does n't know how to act ) as the female lead to that I say WOW ! The only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with . All in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all CGI monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs ( otherwise it would n't have been made for the military DUH ! ) . By far the best scene was when Lizzy McGuire 's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add . I believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch Dinocroc . And as for the director I believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then I can go on living .
0 This is the first non - zombie subgenre review i ve done but this movie is worth doing a review for . Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b - movie . The Dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process . Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs * curse of the komodo*coughs . I enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general . Overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch .
0 What a terrible film . It sucked . It was terrible . I do n't know what to say about this film but DinoCrap , which I stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass . AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! sigh .. It 's not Roger Corman that I hate , it 's this god - awful movie . Well , really ? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics . Which is another thing , the CGI sucked out loud ; I hate this movie dreadfully . This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B - Movie , and probably the gayest B - Movie too . It's - it's--- DINOCRAP ! I 'm sorry , I must have offended some nerds in these moments . It 's just an awful movie ... 0/1,000
0 The movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip - off of Joeseph Conrad 's Heart Of Darkness , the River is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama.<br /><br />The claims made on the outside of the DVD box was overt fraud to < br /><br />take this fabricated death of a Journalist and present it as factual < br /><br />while some portions have Muslims supporting the 9/11 attacks for the USA 's treatment of Muslims around the world .<br /><br />I alerted the Video store that the movie should be removed from their " Documentary " section and be placed in the War - drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events .
0 i went into this hoping it would be the " thought provoking " little gem people have reviewed this as . i love indy films and expected to dig this too . knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained , maybe even see an outsiders perspective.<br /><br />all i can say is wow .... if your into self torture , or mutilation then maybe you 'll like this . personally i do n't like the idea of being pee'd on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage . bad script , bad acting , bad story , bad directing , bad editing .... i could go on . i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 . that 's misleading and ignorant . voting for a movie on IMDb is n't setting a precedent ! it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is OK to watch as long as it 's controversial ( this film is not , it tries VERY HARD to be but fails ) . < br /><br />you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically . unfortunately they do die , but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured . < br /><br />do yourself a favor , just do n't even bother . i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for .50 and feel ripped off !
0 I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one , but when i started with it i found it really awful . They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95 % of the movie is shot in India . you can see Indian made cars . you can see lars drinking bisleri(an Indian water brand ) , Hindi written on the road , you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in Afghanistan . I think one should not waste his / her time watching this movie .. pure time waste .. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but do n't watch this waste of time
0 I watched the first 15 minutes , thinking it was a real documentary ( with an irritatingly overly dramatic " on camera " producer).<br /><br />When I realized it was all staged I thought " why would I want to waste my time watching this junk ? ? " So I turned it off and came online to warn other people . The characters do n't act in a believable way . too much immature emotion . for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country , he acted like a kid . and I do n't believe it was because " his character was so upset about the trade center bombings".<br /><br />very trite and stupid.<br /><br />have you seen " city of lost children " ? french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams ... I liked it !
0 If it was n't for some immature gullible idiot I know insisting that I watch this " documentary " I would never have seen this comedy ! This film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments . One in particular is where the Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away , still filming , presumably to his plush hotel . Then there 's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion.<br /><br />I am surprised this has currently got the rating it has ( 5.8 / 10 ) . I thought IMDb users had more sense .
0 This movie fails miserably on every level . I have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . Maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we wo n't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? My god , I ca n't think of anything I 've ever seen that was this bad . I 'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film . If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film , I 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . That 's my two cents .
0 Well , basically , the movie blows ! It 's Blair Witch meets Sean Penn 's ill conceived fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the " War on Terror " is really about . The script sounds like it was written by 8th grader ( no offense to 8th graders ) ; the two main actors over - act the entire film ; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film(not that i know anything about those things -- but it just did n't look like real documentaries I 've watched ) , and worst of all Christian Johnson took a great idea and made it suck . It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd . I 'd rather watch the Blair Witch VIII , than sit through that again .
0 Amateurish in the extreme . Camera work especially overwrought - documentary camera operators need n't spin around ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />The script is truly inane , and the acting is even worse . On top of that , the story is disjointed and meandering - with some gaping holes in logic . At one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected Al - Quada operatives , and thus get an interview with Osama . I found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws . The " filmmaker" / lead role really portrays a rash , idiot frat boy . The only item of interest really , is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location . It 's truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting.<br /><br />Who financed this crap ?
0 This is the worst movie I have ever seen . I was going to get up and leave at Tape 4 but I stuck it out . I now consider myself a Masochist ! Afghanistan ? Come on guys ! Who 's the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards ? I thought the lead actor(George Calil ) was particularly inept . Apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake , I thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make " Larson the Lunatic Implodes , all over a screen near you " disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11 . Using a phone call from Larson 's wife , Sarah , supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day , was appalling . The camera shake did n't make me feel sick , that cold hearted stunt did .
0 I just got back from this free screening , and this " Osama Witch Project " is the hands - down worst film I 've seen this year , worse than even " Catwoman " - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.<br /><br />In " September Tapes , " a " film crew " of " documentary journalists " heads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip , the conditions and , oh yeah , the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife 's death on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />They " made " eight tapes on their journey , which now " document " their travels and , of course , their attempts to kill the terrorist leader . ( The eight tapes , thankfully , all end at points significant in the narrative , which is convenient for a " documentary.")<br /><br />The psychotic , idiotic protagonist - who is given to long , significant speeches that he probably learned watching " MacGyver " - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps . I do n't know why he did n't just wear a sign on his back that said " Shoot me." < br /><br />The crew 's translator , supposedly their sensible voice - of - reason , does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom . < br /><br />You wish they 'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons.<br /><br />Around " Tape 4 , " I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew .
0 This is a complete Hoax ... <br /><br />The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan . Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian ; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India . The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets . Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur , Rajasthan . The film - makers in their ( about the film ) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around . Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India . The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song . They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song . How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively . They are just on the band - wagon to make big on the issue . I do challenge the film makers to deny it .
0 A Blair Witch - War Movie that is as much of a letdown as Bwitch was ! The title says it all , save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as " Once Upon a Time in America " , " The Shawshank Redemption " or " Enemy at the Gates " ( if you want to watch a GREAT " war " movie ) etc.<br /><br />This movie , if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies , then this movie was High school ball . It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy 's old camera . Sure they went into a hostile area ( to make a film ) but I do n't call that brave , around here we call that plain stupid ! This is a pass all the way ! Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think .
0 I have to say this is an awful movie , for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide , it is listed as a documentary . As I watched it , I started laughing , thinking to myself , does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real ? So I had to look it up , and now see that it is a movie , but now since it is n't a documentary , it is now a movie with bad acting . SO , either way , it is pretty bad . I actually did n't make it to the end . I had to shut it off . I am a NYC Police Officer , and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary , with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers . So , I took it a little personal . Maybe I was blinded by that , and it is n't as bad as I personally think it is . Everyone has their own opinion .
0 Grand Central Murder ( 1942 ) Dir : S. Sylvan Simon < br /><br />Production : MGM < br /><br />This mediocre ' B ' mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as director . Surely he could have fit another Red Skelton film or two on his schedule ! Anyway , Grand Central Murder is a shameless rip - off of the Thin Man films minus the wit , charm , and chemistry of the leads . We are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes , bad acting and weary gags.<br /><br />Van Heflin and Virginia Grey play Nick and Nora Char -- er , Rocky and Butch Custer . He 's a PI and she 's his wife and sleuthing partner . They engage in " humorous " banter with each other . See ? It 's completely different already . Heflin 's the only one here who hints at bigger and better things , although he 's real close to being a jerk in this . Virginia Grey was in Another Thin Man , but again , let me stress , THIS FILM IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ONE , no sir . And just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film ( say , THE THIN MAN ) we actually like , Sam Levene pops up as the lead detective who 's kind of dim and has to have Van Heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads . Hmmm.<br /><br />Quickly , the ' murder ' is that of bitchy schemer Mida King , who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one . She 's played by Patricia Dane , who 's like a C- version of Hedy Lamarr , until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There 's a whole array of wacky suspects , all with their own motivation for wanting Mida dead . There 's the society type , the tough talking dames , the thug , the ex - lover , and a shady theater impresario ( Tom Conway , here saddled with the unlikely character name of ' Frankie Ciro ' ) . Roman Bohnen plays a nervous , jittery type , something I believe he may have done before . Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who , in a running gag that wo n't quit , ca n't stop thinking about the piece of ass he 's got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up ( that 's right , Millard Mitchell , swordsman ) . Finally , in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling , something we 've never seen before , all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories ( as flashbacks ) to the detective , as Rocky takes mental notes , until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confession.<br /><br />On top of the actual picture being a dud , I naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942-era Grand Central , but alas , no . There 's merely one very brief shot at the beginning . Thanks for nothing , Grand Central Murder . So , to sum up , a wee bit formulaic , but Heflin was okay.<br /><br />*½ out of 4
0 I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here . It was fairly easy to watch ( at 3 am ) . It had good casting - Kevin Dillon 's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling . The rest of the main characters were n't so bad either.<br /><br />This is your typical stalker / suspense movie . A married couple can not conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help . A sociopathic " genetic material " donor fixates on the recipients and , in typical stalker form , intrudes into their lives.<br /><br />As I said , most of the movie was fairly good .. we see " Conan " grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother . Of course things do n't work out for him the way he planned . Not a bad plot line.<br /><br />But , the last 15 minutes were just horrible . I am pretty tolerant with movies ( especially at 3 am ! ) .. but , I was just amazed at how bad the ending was written . I actually scoffed outloud!<br /><br />All in all , not the worst movie I 've seen , but I would n't be able to sit through it again ( unless I skipped the ending ) . The only redeaming quality here was Kevin Dillon 's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.<br /><br />Try looking around at the other channels before watching this .. But , if nothing better is on , I 'd give it a try .. =)
0 Routine suspense yarn about a sociopath ( Dillon ) who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman ( Antony ) and his husband ( Mancuso ) . Extremely predictable , far - fetched and with undecided tone all the way . Do n't lose your time with this one ... make a baby instead !
0 Action , violence , sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie . And everything they do is done without reason . Mark L. Lester is ( un)known for his violent ( without reason)movies ( Commando , The Base ) . The story is weird but stupid . The actors play their stupid characters very well ... I'm not telling they are stupid but I mean they are very bad actors . It 's another low - budget unknown B series action movie . If you saw something like Operation Delta Force , Drive , The Patriot , Sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than Misbegotten ... don't rent it ... and , by the way , do n't rent any of the movies I mentioned .... I give it 1and a half out of5 .
0 More of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in ; mediocre overall.<br /><br />It starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed , goes into the room of her crying child , and kills it . She wakes up . Then , that man is dying in a hospital , spitting up blood . His estranged daughter arrives , and he manages to contact her through her dreams ( I think ) , and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely decomposes in its grave.<br /><br />There 's not too much mystery about who did it , or even how ; most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed . I 'm not sure the way he was killed would really have worked.<br /><br />Anyway , the horror elements get in through : a gory autopsy , the recurring dream of the man killing the boy , a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut , and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and actually in his grave.<br /><br />I was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by Fulci to Clive Barker ! Interesting .
0 He really lost the plot with this one ! None of his distinctive trademarks here at all , an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film ( in my opinion ) . Even his trademark gore is gone , bar one scene in an operating theatre . Oh well , at least his next film ' Nightmare Concert ' showed that he could still shock when he wanted to ...
0 This is definitely not one of Lucio Fulci 's better flicks by any stretch of the imagination . The plot is pretty bad , a millionaire is murdered and his spirt calls upon his daughter to find out who did it . But the biggest problem i have with this ( besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie ) was wondering why anyone should even care ? The father comes off as being a really big jerk to everyone he came across ( including the daughter who he asks to help him ) which made it quite hard for anyone to care who killed him . But no one really watches a Fulci flick for a good storyline , to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting . Typically his movies try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore but even that is lacking in this movie . If you 're looking for a good Fulci flick , check out The Beyond .
0 Seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio " Zombi " Fulci might be up to his old tricks . Unfortunately , other than the close ups of a rotting corpse , there 's little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter 's quest to figure out who killed him . None of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it ( that twist , at least , was cool ) , you stop caring . The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert !
0 I 'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci ; many of his Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time , but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I 've come to expect from the great Italian director . The film is neither interesting , like some of Fulci 's more tame Giallo 's , or gory like the majority of his cult classics ; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas , and ultimately ensuring that the film is n't very good . The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously , but still it 's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife , which is the ultimate unknown . This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi ; a man that is n't exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage , there are n't many people that are sad to see him go . This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife , and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death , and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter.<br /><br />The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is " in the style of HP Lovecraft " , and that 's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I 've ever seen . There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale , and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon / Lovecraft film , ' From Beyond ' - which is a lot better . The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style , and the score is rather good . Unfortunately , however , Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying . The plot plays out in a really boring way , and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost ' desperately ' trying to find things out , or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members . This movie was made for Italian TV , and so it 's not surprising that it 's all rather tame . There 's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies ; but this is n't the Fulci we all know and love . Overall , this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci 's talents . Not worth bothering with , unless you 're a Fulci completist .
0 I am a huge Charlton Heston fan . He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time , but what was he thinking when he made this movie . Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the screenwriter or director , but in this case it 's all him . The suckiness of this movie is all his fault . It proves that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting . I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and I 'll never get that time back . This is by far THE WORST Heston movie that I 've ever seen . If you are a Shakespeare fan maybe you 'll find this movie entertaining , but if you 're not do n't waste your time , you 'll regret it in the long run .
0 ALMOST GOLDEN : THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format : Stereo < br /><br />Bland , soap - opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of America 's first female TV news anchor . With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster , but the flimsy story really was n't worth the effort . A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go . Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor - belt manner , but it 's all as superficial as old fluff , and just as engaging .
0 I know that in this episode there 's other stuff apart from what I am going to discuss , and in fact I think it has some virtues ; for example , the fact , after we had been given a very negative opinion of Jin from seeing Sun 's flashbacks in " House of the Rising Sun " , we get to see Jin 's side of things and get a new , more balanced understanding of his life.<br /><br />But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode . Before now , in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt , it had been hinted that Sun 's father was someone who was getting rich through shady , illegal methods . I thought maybe he was a mob boss , even ; mobs operate in Korea , just like in almost every other country in the world , so it was a reasonable possibility . However , in this episode we learn that Sun 's father is in fact the boss ( or a top executive ) of a Korean automotive company , and that what Jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official ( who was actually going to be murdered ) on his behalf.<br /><br />I may be especially touchy about this because I happen to work in the automotive industry , but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in Korea ; that huge , serious companies like Hyundai or Kia ( which must be the model for this fictitious car company , as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality ) operate with these mafia - like methods , instead of like any normal automotive company of the West . it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story , and that there has n't been an uproar in Korea over it . It feels like extraneous " Buy American ! " propaganda , portraying foreign car companies as criminal , untrustworthy , third - world outfits .
0 Dear Richard , I know we all loved you on Home Improvement with Tim Allen . But seriously , do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to Air Bud ? I would have thought Tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant . I know that seems ironic , but the pay benefits are much more rewarding.<br /><br />Everybody would see you around Tim and instantly think " Tool Time " . You would even get roles with Bob Vila more often . Instead , you appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smiling . I know there was n't much of a script , but you could have added to it . I mean , come on . Tim owes you one.<br /><br />But seriously , this movie does nothing for the Air Bud line . Quite the contrary , the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports . The original was better . And you , Mr. Richard Karn , know that more than anybody.<br /><br />This is an " F " movie .
0 My 7-year - old daughter loved it , as Disney execs crassly calculated that she would . That 's the problem with " Air Buddies . " It 's a strictly by - the - numbers children 's film filled with carefully calculated cuteness , a couple politically correct morals , and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating . As a parent , or even as a 10-year - old , you 've seen it all before , and done better before . Think " 101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone " and you get the general idea . I 'm of the opinion that a good children 's story is a good story , period . " Air Buddies , " which is about as original as recycled paper , fails to meet that standard . It is n't the worst video your child could watch , but there are megatons of better ones .
0 Although this is generally a cheesy jungle - adventure movie , it does have some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful , and the pacing of the adventure is good . You wo n't be bored watching it.<br /><br />Keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead , an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghai'd into escorting rich boy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife Shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country . He never takes things seriously . Shower is there as decoration and Keith makes extensive use of her - she does n't really have to act much . She 's not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a T / A picture.<br /><br />There 's nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it , or away from it . Produced to be shlock , it succeeds without too much fuss . A good 2 AM cable programmer .
0 Looking through the other comments , I 'm amazed that there are n't any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage . First off , I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered Indiana Jones knock - off . What I got was one of the most offensive movies I can remember trying to sit through , made all the more shocking by the movie 's comparatively high production values.<br /><br />I do n't think this is a spoiler , but if it is , be warned ... <br /><br />If your idea of entertainment is watching Bimbo getting raped from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief , while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other 's severed head , by all means , rent this flick . If not , I 'd advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment.<br /><br />Come to think of it , that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that there 's nothing else I really need to say about it .
0 In the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments , I 'd like to offer some advice ( free of charge ! ) , from a viewer 's perspective . If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film , do it . If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films , go ahead . DO NOT try to make both at the same time , it does n't work . For example , having a goofy " comic relief " character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal 's head just makes you look like you had NO IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make . This one is boring , meandering , cheap , racist .... you get the picture . A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower ( way too prissy here ) are hardly worth your trouble . There is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film 's existence . ( * 1/2 )
0 The acting was n't great , the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters . It 's about the repercussions of the struggle between right - wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side . Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just is n't strong enough to answer both questions ( supposing those were the director 's questions , too ) . Still , some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film , set in Antwerp . After all , this city has been the starting point of the extremist right - wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures . It 's very difficult to make a film about this situation , and this one is n't successful , unfortunately . Still , it 's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present - day Belgium . The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it 's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium , a 10 million people country , in the 2000s < br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
0 This movie is about a cop ( Ching Wan Lau ) trying to catch a super - clever thief ( Ekin Cheng ) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a Kelly Lin . Basically , whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand . This movie , covered by handsome lead actors , beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes , really has no substance at all . It 's all flash , and the flash quickly becomes dull too . I lost all interests a third of the way into the movie , and there is no redeeming quality after that , except for the cinematography , which looks good . Only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free . Also , consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it 's all the same to the end : BORING . 6/10
0 Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came along , there 's been a lot of talk about a revival of the Hong Kong movie industry . Do n't believe it . The people now making movies in HK give new meaning to the word crass . Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example . Ekin Cheng is the name draw , here , but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin . He flips the coin over and over and again and again . Why ? Who knows ? Sean Lau plays a cop who chases after the coin - flipping pretty boy . But once again : who knows why ? There 's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera . Nothing makes any sense . There is no action . There is no sex . There is no comedy . All there is is a name : Ekin Cheng . And you know what ? Who cares ?
0 The previous poster obviously worked on the movie . It 's a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did . Mentioning all of the actors ' names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he 's involved with it in some way.<br /><br />It 's on Cinemax right now and I was sure this was some movie where porn stars ( the one called Ava is gorgeous and well - endowed ) were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason.<br /><br />Also , when I first saw it , I was sure it was made in about 1986 , and I was born in ' 73 , so I thought I knew what i was talking about ... but no ... it was made in 1993 ! ! Unbelievable!<br /><br />Though I would call it one of those so bad it 's good movies . Like watching a train wreck .
0 I was unsure whether or not Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit " Malibu Express . " With his film Fit to Kill he has proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one - shot director . The plot written by Sidaris , which was ungratefully passed up by the Academy , is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns . The main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as KSXY . Cleverly , KSXY is actually their secret headquarters . In " Fit to Kill " they confront their long - time nemesis Kane , who is trying to steal one of Russia 's most prized diamonds . A well - written screenplay is not all , excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic . Panned by the critics and the box office , this film will be appreciated in years to come . It is now suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver did , but in the future will undoubtly become recognized . I am disappointed no critic circles have recognized Andy Sidaris 's trademark filmmaking . The costumes , the special effects , all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking . It may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself . My personal rating is 10/10 . The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride , and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero . Andy , keep up the good work .
0 If you want to see women 's breasts , get a porno . There is no plot , but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan . The only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny , and , yes , boobs are boobs .
0 Unbelievably awful film . I watched part of this on T.V. recently . My jaw dropped as I watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind - numbing drivel . Not a single line from the master of one - liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle . It was so bad it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield 's body , slap him around and scream , " How could you ? " I know many films are done in haste , hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme . But please , Hollywood , show a little respect for your audience . It 's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe . The bottom of the cesspool , even by Sunday afternoon television standards .
0 Having watched 10 minutes of this movie I was bewildered , having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - I simply could n't believe it : The movie is really awful . In fact it is so awful , that I had to watch all of it just to be convinced ( ! ) . During this , I came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of Danish so - called comedies from the 60 's and 70 's . The pattern is as follows : Take one extremely popular comedian , make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible , add a bunch of jokes ( especially one - liners ) , and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that , and you have a success ! I would n't know if this movie was a success , but unlike the Danish tradition which died quietly ( with a few great comedians ) it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the US .
0 Rodney Dangerfield is a great . He has done a lot of great works . But this one .... is awful . The whole plot is whack . It could have been much better . The jokes in the movie are n't funny .... their stupid . This was very not so hilarious . He can do much better than this .
0 This movie was so bad , outdated and stupid that I had rough times to watch it to the end . I had seen this Rodney guy in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny as hell in it , but this movie was crap . The " jokes " were n't funny , actors were n't funny , anything about it was n't even remotely funny . Do n't waste your time for this ! Only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon who I 'm sure tried her best , but the script was just too awful . That 's why I rated it " 2 " instead of " 1 " , but it 's definitely one of the worst films I 've ever seen .
0 I have to confess right off that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield . Indeed , from me he gets " no respect . " I watched this only because my wife wanted to see it , and found exactly what I expected : a stupid story without any real humour . It 's full of lame , crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer 's ( Dangerfield ) plans to build a ski resort in Utah that just did n't capture my attention at all.<br /><br />In addition to Dangerfield the film starred a weak cast , including the likes of Andrew Dice Clay and the totally over the hill John Byner ( I did n't even know he was still around until I saw his name in the credits for this.)<br /><br />This truly is a Dangerfield disaster.<br /><br />2/10
0 I almost burst into tears watching this movie . Not from laughing but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie . Candyshack was his first and stole the movie , Easy Money had him at his best , and Back To School is by far an 80 's classic masterpiece . Then there was Ladybugs and that 's when it started to show . Poor Rodney was getting old ( Meet Wally Sparks was a slight step up from Ladybugs but not saying much ) . < br /><br />In My 5 Wives Rodney plays Monte ( a name he must love since that was his name in Easy Money ) a rich ( is nt he always ) guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing . Well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the Amish , he inherits 5 Wives . This sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie . The problem is EVERYTHING . The script is so poor that Rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do . The movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not Rodney . Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the F word ( which he should since the film is rated R but plays as if it was PG ) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo . Do n't get me wrong , at times I did laugh at a few of Rodney 's jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow . We can see his jokes coming from miles . And the film turns way too PC which thanks to the horrible 1990 's , the 70 's and 80 's Rodney just does n't work anymore .
0 This was a watchable movie , but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney 's earlier movies . With that said , it was worth the time to watch . I gave this a 5 out of 10 . So basically , its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see , but if you find it on the tube , take a chance .
0 When Rodney Dangerfield is on a roll , he 's hilarious . In My 5 Wives , he 's not on a roll . The timing of the one - liners is off , but they 're the best thing going for the movie . The five women who play the wives do n't add up to one whole actress between them . The plot is very weak . Even the premise is pretty weak ; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives , but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie . Most of the movie could play the same way even if Rodney 's character had only one wife , so the premise seems more like an old man 's fantasy than a key part of the comedy . Another old man 's fantasy : we 're supposed to accept that Rodney 's character is an athletic skier.<br /><br />Jerry Stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor , and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work.<br /><br />The odd nods to political correctness later in the movie do n't really do anything for the movie . For those who like their movies politically correct , the non - PC humor is still there in the first place , and the seeming apologies for it still do n't get the point . For those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness , the PC add - ins are just annoying digressions.<br /><br />This has to be the mildest R - rated movie I 've ever seen . There are some racy jokes , and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking TV 40 years ago , but that 's about it . Maybe it was the topless men ( kidding).<br /><br />The DVD features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles . I kept wondering if they were serious or kidding . They seem to be serious , but I kept thinking , " They must be kidding ! " There 's also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the Mormons or the Church of Latter - Day Saints , that somehow it 's not about them . Never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in Utah , and makes reference to Brigham Young.<br /><br />In short , My 5 Wives was a disappointment . I was hoping for Rodney on a roll , but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time .
0 As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield , this was a terrible movie . The plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies , but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes . In addition it was annoying and boring and that 's being kind . If you 're looking for a good laugh , rent a copy of Private Parts .
0 If you seen Rodney Dangerfield 's previous movies and performances , you 'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck . Written like a sitcom , this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout , from the self - help doctor played by the aways sexy - as - chopped liver Molly Shannon to the ' I 'm fat , and therefore funny ' John Linette . The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough , and if this had been done as a pilot for an action - adventure series , it might have worked . Instead , it comes off like a male fantasy that 's trying hard not to be politically incorrect .
0 This movie features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey . It also boasts the always enjoyable Larry Miller in a too - small part . Despite this I found it to be nearly unwatchable . Michelle Monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for Downey 's character 's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it 's portrayed . The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film , having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so.<br /><br />Fans of the film say that those who disagree simply " do n't get it " . I do n't think this is so . The plot was not complicated or beyond understanding . It was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured . I " got it " . I just did n't like it . Paddy Breathnach 's " I Went Down " and Guy Ritchie 's " Snatch " and " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " are much better realized examples of the kind of film - making that director Shane Black fails to achieve.<br /><br />I share a birthday with Shane Black but a look at his credits ( mostly as a screenwriter)makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection .
0 < br /><br />The movie " Slugs " is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry . You see , these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and do n't mean to do anything malicious , they 're just slugs- slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison , but slugs none the less . The real bad guys are the humans , who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs , or overreact when they encounter them.<br /><br />For example , take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs . They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them , and they reacted instinctively , defending themselves and biting the guy . Now , instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite , this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot , spills some highly volatile chemicals , starts a fire , knocks a bookcase over on himself , and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes . How can you blame that on the slugs?<br /><br />This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable . The characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody , the drunk hick who 's mean to his dog , and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty - five years older than him . There 's also a set of drunken teens < br /><br />that get attacked while copulating , and we have to see the skinny long - haired freaks ' genitals . Meanwhile , there 's a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells " You do n't have the authority to declare happy birthday ! " for some reason . Finally , this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the MST3 K classic " Pod People " whose face explodes after eating a slug - laces salad ( another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful , harmless slugs).<br /><br />Humans are portrayed as greedy , stupid , racist , alcoholic , and , in one pointless scene , as would - be rapists . In the movie 's climactic scene , the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers , Well , since they 're idiots , the humans succeed in BLOWING UP THE ENTIRE TOWN . They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did!<br /><br />If you hate humans , and I know I do , you 'll appreciate " Slugs " . If you 're a fan of bad cinema , you 'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of " Pieces " and " Pod People " . There 's enough bad acting , silly dialog , illogical plot twists , lame special effects , pointless scenes , and poor dubbing to hold your attention .
0 I love killer Insects movies they are great fun to watch , I had to watch this movie as it was one of my Favourite horror books by Shaun Hutson.<br /><br />I have met him and I wish I did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he Said it was , after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot : People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely , and nobody has a clue what the cause is.<br /><br />Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution , but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities.<br /><br />Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England begins snooping around does it begin to look like Mike had the right idea after all.<br /><br />This movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie ! Slugs in this movie are fast ( Then normal ) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes ! < br /><br />This movie is nothing like the book at all , the book was ten times scarier , ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!<br /><br />I did n't like this movie at all ! As I am huge fan of Slugs the book and second book called Breeding ground ! Both of books are Great < br /><br />Read the book then watch the movie , you may like more then I did Give this 2 out 10
0 This is a mildly interesting late 80 's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood . If you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this . The acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks , but the movie is n't a complete waste of time . The special effects are actually quite good , and the gore is well done . It reminded me of the remake of the Blob , probably because of the sliminess of it all . All in all , you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time , but I would n't suggest seeing this movie unless you 've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing .
0 Mike Brady ( Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic " The Warriors " ) is the first person in the community to realize that there 's murderous slugs in his small town . Not just any slugs , mind you , but carnivorous killer bigger then normal , mutated by toxic waste slugs ( who still only go as fast as a normal slug , which is n't that frightening , but I digress ) . No one will believe him at first , but they will . Oh yes , they will.<br /><br />OK , killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork 's baby in the creepiness factor . So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go . The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the ' so bad that it 's good ' variety . I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs : the Movie as opposed to Slugs : the Children 's Game or Slugs : the Other White Meat . Probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game . Director Juan Piquer Simón is more widely known for his previous films " Pod People " ( which MST3 K deservedly mocked ) and " Peices " ( which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made ) < br /><br />Eye Candy : Kari Rose shows T&A < br /><br />My Grade : D+ < br /><br />DVD Extras : Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
0 This could have been a rather entertaining film , but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain . Had they played this flick tongue - in - cheek , it could have been a very entertaining film , like Re - Animator or Dead ALive , but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue - in - cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs . There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive , meat - eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot . Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy . The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid ( actors and screenwriter ) the scenario of destroying the slugs is.<br /><br />STORY : $ $ ( No new ground charted here . Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue - in - cheek but the dialogue is straight . Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one - liners and eccentric characters , this could have been a cult film).<br /><br />VIOLENCE : $ $ $ ( You wo n't be letdown here . We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant . The blood and guts , that many horror film watchers enjoy , is in full swing here . You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes).<br /><br />ACTING : $ ( Wow ! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film - making endeavor is . Kim Terry , as his wife , does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold - your - face - while - you - scream bit . The " teenagers " were all horrible actors - no exceptions . Man , this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs ! ) < br /><br />NUDITY : $ $ ( Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl 's bedroom . Both male and female nudity here ) .
0 All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene , where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten . Then they start rolling the title credits : You see " Slugs ! " in big letters , followed shortly thereafter by " The Movie . " WHEW ! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into " Slugs : The Musical " or " Slugs : The Game Show . " Anyway , from there the movie deteriorates into a kill - fest . You see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove , two people get attacked by slugs while having sex , and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs . It 's a pretty silly movie , falling in the " so - bad - it's - good " category . It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you 're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 ( my guess was 1974 ) . I 'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has here , because most people here do n't give those types of movie any love . But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable , this is one of your prime candidates .
0 Ok , where do we start with this little gem ? Mutant slugs begin to take over a small New England ( ? ) town . Only one man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady ! Now , if that was n't laughable enough , stay tuned.<br /><br />The footage of the slugs is what 's known as stock footage . No matter who the slugs attack or where they are , the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown . Keep in mind , this singular shot occupies at least half the movie.<br /><br />The acting in the movie was knock down , drag out , steal your wallet , punch your girlfriend , kill your dog , BAD . I 'm sure there 's worse , but you 're going to be hard pressed to find it . The only gem was ... you guessed it .... MIKE BRADY ! He must have taken a few night classes at the YMCA , because he was the best in the bunch.<br /><br />As for horror ? This film is not to be taken seriously . There is n't horror ! They 're slugs for crying out loud . The entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two . Only watch this film in a MST3 K type environment , otherwise I can see some major damage to the brain .
0 In all of low budget history . this movie has to be one of the worst . True ther are some humorous sides to the movie , but in general it was just plain awful . I just ca n't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs . I mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet . The only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man . This was rather amusing .
0 is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface . So in that respect , IMDb 's average voting score is spot on.<br /><br />A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of " Falcon Crest " dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time , as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />The slugs involved are originals from Asturias , northern Spain , but as they were not allowed into the United States , plastic ones had to be made . However , chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner - time salad contrasts rather weirdly with Parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other US forgotten hits ( or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it ) . The actors involved were also a rather tatty array , just suitable for a low - budget film which might be categorised as horrific , horrifying , horrible or just simple awful.<br /><br />As a result , the outcome is negligible on the surface , undetected underground , and about as attractive as Chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad .
0 Just kidding ! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! It was so bad though , that it was hilarious . My friend and I purposly rented it because it looked so bad . Cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs . The plot stunk , some of the voices were dubbed , the quality was horrendous . But I sure had a blast watching it !
0 I 'm not even gon na waste time on this one ; it 's not funny , not scary , practically unwatchable and only occassionaly gory(the FX suck though(no pun intended ) ) . This is a disclaimer ; WATCH AT YOUR PERIL ! Ask yourself 1 question ; Are slugs scary ?
0 Basically this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity , which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns . Watching the Detectives has none of that.<br /><br />The premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored , thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads , not to mention the lack of any real visual story - telling style . I mean , this film is centered around MOVIES , yet is itself incredibly uncinematic ! That 's a major failing right there.<br /><br />But the main problem is we simply do n't care about the main characters because the script and the actors ( Murphy and Liu ) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way . So the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem , well , not terribly interesting.<br /><br />Oh , yeah , another thing : For a romantic comedy ? It 's not funny . And the romance is n't terribly romantic , either.<br /><br />So avoid it . Even at its 90-something minute running time it 's just not worth sitting through ...
0 Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors , who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them.<br /><br />Unfortunately ' Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' offers only one to both actors and audience alike : not to fall asleep during a mind - numbingly boring , very predictable and unimaginative story.<br /><br />'Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' tries very hard to be funny , but the comedy is forced , extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule.<br /><br />After a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience , like the director 's friends and relatives , is even hinted at , not to mention actually happening.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like Neil 's ex - girlfriend did when he showed her an old B&W film she could n't care less about . ' Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' is nowhere near category B , it falls somewhere between Q & R , like -Questions ? and -Repress the questions ! The director knows what he 's doing ! Well , if his goal was to bore the viewer to death , he has done a very good job!<br /><br />'Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy , bur PLEASE do n't let it be a waste of your time!<br /><br />Rating : 0 out of 100 .
0 At one point , Violet ( Lucy Liu ) tells Neil ( Cillian Murphy ) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure . She said " because I 'm bore - phobic " . It mean that she ca n't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities . Well , I think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic . Because " Watching the Detectives " is a cheer boredom . < br /><br />Have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once ? Neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop . He and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward . But Neil 's life is completely turned around when Violet walks into his store . She 's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him . Anyway , after some dates , they decide to see each other . The problem is Violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on Neil and ca n't really doing something normal , whereas Neil is completely opposite to hers . The question is . Is they are going to be in love at the end ? You bet.<br /><br />"Watching the Detectives " is a cliché romantic - comedy to its core . And they made it even worst by pretending to be something else . From the first couple of set - up , we know that Neil is pretty laid - back guy who did n't really commit to anything . And then , Violet enters the scene , looking all weird and annoying . So at this point , we all know that we 're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they 're going to end up in the end . Is it worth waiting for ? I would say no.<br /><br />As I said , they tried to give something more for the audience . " Watching the Detectives " is trying to talk about commitment . To observe how far people go to reach for something they desire . We knew in the end that insane things that Violet has done is all the test how far Neil is ready to go to win her heart ( or whatever ) . Well , I think it is completely bullshit . This movie will end pretty quick if Neil just said to himself " Forget about it , that girl is one of a nutjob ! " After collaborating with many great directors recently ( Danny Boyle 's " Sunshine " and " 28 Days Later " , Ken Loach 's " The Wind That Shakes the Barley " and Neil Jordan 's " Breakfast on Pluto " to name a few ) , it 's pretty weird choice for Cillian Murphy to make a movie with one of Broken Lizard comedy troop , Paul Soter . By all means , He 's not bad ( as usual ) , but such a talent actor like him should n't be wasting his time in the movie like this . On the other hand , Lucy Liu is dreadfully awful as Violet . Her acting is a mess . I mean it 's all over the place and so over - the - top . Tony Montana would have been proud.<br /><br />The last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title . You simply ca n't really connect a dot between the plot and its title ; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all . In short , " Watching the Detectives " is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable TV so quick that you could n't imagine.<br /><br />BloodyMonday Rating : 1.5/4
0 Well , I finally saw it . I did n't go when it first came out because , well , frankly , I was afraid . Afraid of how bad it might be , or how disappointing . While not as bad as Menace , and better than Clones , it was n't particularly memorable , or satisfying.<br /><br />I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars . I still remember sitting in the theater . From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I 'll never forget . A timeless story of the bored farm - boy who just knows he was meant for more , saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard , the rogue pirate and the various comic relief -- all in a space - opera setting.<br /><br />And that 's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula . It 's an old formula precisely because it works . And to his credit , he gave it new twists that made it very special.<br /><br />Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale . Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time . The great villain , Vader was Luke 's father . Wow , no one saw that coming . Of course , I 'm convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay . Go back and watch Star Wars again . Knowing what you know now , particularly in light of the first three episodes , see if it really meshes.<br /><br />Which brings me to the problem I have . Revenge is an entertaining movie -- tremendous effects , plenty of action , some good fighting scenes . But a movie still lives or dies on its plot -- the story it is telling . Oh , certainly , really good acting can save a weak plot , but a weak plot coupled with bad acting -- that 's a burden no director can overcome , certainly not one as bad as I 'm forced to realize George Lucas is ( The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors -- Liam Neeson , Natalie Portman , Samuel Jackson).<br /><br />*****SPOILERS AHEAD * * * * * * * * The plot . Oh my . Understand , he 's already handicapped by what 's happened in the first two films so it 's an incredible burden . One too much for him to overcome.<br /><br />First we have the sheer absurdities of the background . We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine , the product of a virginal , miracle birth -- the " chosen one " . Well , this detail never gets remotely explained . Indeed , the closest explanation is Yoda 's observation that maybe they were wrong . Oh , well , okay then . Our mistake.<br /><br />Now , this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO . Hey , what a coincidence that is . And he 'll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there ? Wow ! How about that . Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there , eh George ? Anyway , we have this bratty kid , moody , petulant , whining young adult , who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history -- the great tragedy of Darth Vador -- the good guy who falls from grace , only to finally achieve redemption in the end.<br /><br />How , pray tell , does this happen ? Why , he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth . Now , sure , he lives in a star - spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline , but does it occur to the " dark one to be " to maybe check with a physician cause maybe , just maybe , this futuristic society might can do something about this problem ? Why , no , the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they 've been chasing for two films tells him that he 's got the secret to immortality.<br /><br />Well , of course he does.<br /><br />Sheesh.<br /><br />How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it ? How can anyone expect us to care ? Hell , why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place . I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil , but because he was pathetically stupid.<br /><br />Oh , by the way , Amidala finally dies . In childbirth . Why ? Well , they do n't know . The doctor , who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced , offers only the conclusion of " she 's lost the will to live " . Well , oh , okay , of course she has . Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.<br /><br />But here we are . We have Kenobi present for all this . He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia . Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them . Knows , also , the role of both R2 and C3PO . And yet , in several years , as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 ( curiously , 3PO 's mind is wiped , but not R2's -- why ? ? ? ? ) stating " I think these droids belong to you " , Kenobi , who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be " the chosen one " and apprentice to the Emperor himself , and who just happened to be built on this very planet , says " strange , I do n't recall owning any droids".<br /><br />Oh good grief.<br /><br />Lucas simply made this up as he went along . Once he introduced VAder as Luke 's father , sadly , the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS . The plot of Episodes 1 - 3 is simply incomprehensible . Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all . And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars.<br /><br />It 's an afterthought , and it looks it.<br /><br />I ca n't give this movie a high rating . It reminds me of Triple X. A fun film to watch , but entirely forgettable . Star Wars will stand in my mind forever . Thankfully , this one , and the two preceding it , will soon fade .
0 To make a film straddling the prequels and the " real " Star Wars trilogy would tax even a great film - maker .... Mr Lucas is not that film - maker.<br /><br />To portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not that actor.<br /><br />The first 60 - 80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original Star Wars.<br /><br />Count Dooku ( Christopher Lee ) has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent ! < br /><br />No the film only picks up with the Chancellor turning on the Jedi and has one great ( overlong ) sequence at the lava falls
0 I 'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck . It finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films . With Jedi , Menace , Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas ' career . He wants us to swallow the Annakin is Vader nonsense ? I never believed it was true . This film vindicates those feelings . The story has n't worked since Phantom Moron , and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade . I have to go . I know where some new rocks to throw are . You want spoilers ? Here they come . Luke and Leia are NOT related . Vader is NOT their Father . Duke Countoo should have switched sides while he still could . Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra . His advice has never been any good to anybody . Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films . Annakin did n't build C3P0 . He found him in the desert and lied to his Mom about putting him together from scratch . Chewbacca has fleas . This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h Amma - Lamma - Ding - Dong . If she had any brains she would n't have come within a light year of Annie , but she had told do what George Lucas wrote for her . What a dope !
0 Ludicrous . Angelic 9-year - old Annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year - old Annakin , who somehow seems appealing to Amidala , 5 years his senior . Now 22-year - old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams , and so takes to slaughtering children , his friends , and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a ) his precious wife might really die , and b ) only he can prevent this . Ludicrosity squared.<br /><br />I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention . The story is ridiculous . The characters are unbelievable ( literally , not the perverted sense of " fantastic " , " wonderful " , etc.).<br /><br />Obi - wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series , but in the climax , he hacks off Annakin 's legs , lets him burn in the lava , and leaves him to suffer . Does n't anyone think that 's a little out of character ? Not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living , as it turns out.<br /><br />I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations . None of that here . The story could have been written by a 10 year old.<br /><br />Oh yeah , the CGI is pretty cool .
0 First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do n't read the books , play the games , wear the underwear or eat the cereal ( if there is one ) . I am simply a fan of the films.<br /><br />With that being said , I struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise . Taking this movie by itself , and not comparing it to it 's terrible predecessors ( EP 1 , 2 ) , I do n't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie . For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue , contrived scenes ( ie R2 suddenly being a badass , and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch ) , HORRIBLE acting , and noted plot holes ... how is this good ? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin ; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden . I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so ( which by the way was ruined by the " NOOOOOO ! " Frankenstein scene ) . When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one - liners when more could have and should have been said , this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE . For a film with such a " dark " tone , there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.<br /><br />I close with a question : From the beginning to the end of the film , was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place ?
0 Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting , then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes , with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series . The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow -- and I mean slow -- build - up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader . And when that finally comes , it 's pretty all right . Not great . Not even good . But pretty all right . This movie is being vastly over - praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels . Instead it 's just turgid , dull , and routine . But you have to say , wow , those CGI environments are really impressive at times . Bu the lightsabre fights ? They 're all a blurry mess . I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed . This will make a ton of money , but thank god it 's over , this once - worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough . I saw the 12:01 show , and after it , I heard a group of very small kids say , wow that was awesome ! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing : I fell asleep in the middle . It was kind of boring . I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better . So said we all .
0 This kind of storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it 's got George Lucas behind it , and it has the words " Star " and " Wars " in its title . That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers , and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story , writing and acting , but did not get the credit . This is a travesty.<br /><br />First things first . The story . Anakin 's evolution ? There is none . Apart from a little make - up around the eyes , and a little yelling , there is none . He becomes young , stupid , cocky Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow . The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence , how good he was at almost everything he did , planning , fighting , you name it . The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity . He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.<br /><br />What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith ? Unacceptable!<br /><br />The fight scenes used too many digital doubles . Everyone 's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make - believe doll house . Count Dooku , Emperor Palpatine , Anakin , Obi - Wan , almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.<br /><br />In one specific fight scene , Obi - Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle , they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes , to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart . I realize the fights are choreographed , but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.<br /><br />The writing was awful . All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality . The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines , but that just was n't enough . I ca n't say enough bad things about this film . Too much special effects , plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe , and absolutely no insights into any of the characters . This is the biggest mistake of this film : nothing new is offered . We know the rough picture of everything , all Lucas did was colour it in.<br /><br />We knew Anakin lost his limbs . We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister , we knew Luke is Anakin 's son , we knew Obi - Wan and Yoda go to exile , we knew everything . Nothing new is offered in this film . If that 's all the fans wanted , then that 's fine , Lucas could n't have gone wrong.<br /><br />But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader , and he asks after Padme , and hears she is dead , he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams " Nooooooooooooooooooooo . " That scene screamed B - movie all the way , and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go " DANGER WILL ROBINSON , DANGER " at any time . That is what this is . A B - movie , disguised by a huge budget and a ultra - loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the Earth .
0 What a disappointment ... admittedly the best of the prequels , but the story is weak , the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces , poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly . There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films , and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years . I wo n't complain about the abysmal dialogue , as this is Star Wars ... the original three films had style , cult feeling and cracking stories , and the strange dialogue added charm . The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money , and this lack of love shows in spades . Utterly disappointing .
0 Well , I guess I 'll have to be the one to say " The Emperor has no clothes . " When I saw this show listed for PBS last night I was both hopeful and apprehensive . I loved " Morse " ( even going so far as to buy the complete DVD set ) and felt that , while I always liked Kevin Whately 's Sgt . Lewis character , the show WAS John Thaw , period ! After watching the new " Inspector Lewis " ( as it is billed here ) , I am more convinced then ever that I was right ... Whately is fine ( even though he looks awful ( both badly aged and too fat ) , but he simply does n't have the charisma to carry the show as did Thaw.<br /><br />And as for his " sidekick " Fox , well ... perhaps the reviewers here from England can understand what he 's saying , but I for one mostly could not.<br /><br />As for Ms. Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that they should have left " Morse " rest in peace .
0 Movie did n't have much plot and was uninteresting . Basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint . Also it 's very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue -- partially because of the accents , but also because words are mumbled .
0 Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial , we tend to lose interest really fast.<br /><br />I found out an exciting fact from this film : someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule ! And guess what , they really would like to be doing something else ( the viewer has similar feelings).<br /><br />Surprisingly , when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film , I found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging.<br /><br />I just do n't usually watch that much late night TV , so I ca n't recommend this film , unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life .
0 Billed as a kind of sequel to The Full Monty , about unemployed men in Sheffield , this movie is a fake.<br /><br />As someone born in Sheffield , and still with links to the city , I was extremely disappointed by this film . Someone said it could have been set in Oklahoma , and that just about sums it up for me . This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the US market . Probably many Americans - and many southern English people - do n't realize that Sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants , with a sophisticated urban culture . In Among Giants it was depicted as some dreary dead - end semi - rural small town , where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old - fashioned pub , and where the people 's idea of a party was line - dancing in some village - hall lookalike . This was a small close - knit community , not a metropolitan city.<br /><br />The working - class Sheffield men were totally unlike their real - life counterparts , who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks . They do n't chatter , and they certainly do n't sing in choirs.<br /><br />Even the rural settings , supposedly in the Peak District , looked alien to me . I recognized a few places where I used to go hiking , but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales . Indeed , in the credits at the end I spotted a reference to Gwynedd , Wales . The Peak District is , in the summer , crawling with walkers and tourists in cars . It is situated between two big cities . It is not some kind of wilderness.<br /><br />As for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with , and lust after , Pete Postlethwaite , that was ludicrous , and could only have been a male dream . Her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent . None of the men was shown as having a partner or families ; they existed in a vacuum.<br /><br />Anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed Sheffielders would have been led astray . This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle - class writers and film - makers.<br /><br />It was a gigantic fake!<br /><br / >
0 This apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing ! Rachel Griffiths must have needed the money . The film must have been made on a very low budget , because the lighting was non existent . I made a vow if I ever see Pete Postlesumthingor other I 'll commit suicide . I 'd be happy to know if there was 1 ) a plot or 2)a script . My biggest regret is I wasted my time watching this rubbish .
0 If my memory is correct , when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry . If that 's what it 's supposed to be , it does n't really work . It just is n't that funny . Setting that rather significant ( since this is called a comedy ! ) failure aside , since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter , I 'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour , except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull . < br /><br />For over an hour , this movie really does n't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters . Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls are n't giving " full service " - a euphemism for actual sex . As for the girls themselves , Betty 's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business , Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is - well , Leah is a somewhat strange , undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well , because she 's in it ! I have no idea what her character was about . Those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business.<br /><br />The movie meanders about and does n't offer much until the " twist " reveals Conrad to be the bad guy . We should have gotten to that point sooner . The only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story - Conrad 's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls . That plan for revenge was pretty good , and you 're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you 're wondering why you wasted your time with this . Had the story been more focused on the revenge , this might have actually been a fairly funny movie.<br /><br />The performances from the 4 leads were all OK , although I did n't think anyone came across as outstanding . All four characters were a bit shallow . Cindy was a sympathetic character , and so was Conrad for a while , although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie . Given the subject matter , there 's surprisingly little nudity ( and what there is is restricted to one scene . ) In fact , there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this . As for the overall quality of the movie , it 's a low - budget effort , which shows , although you expect a certain griminess , I suppose , of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour , so that 's forgivable . It certainly says something , though , that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer - director Soo Lyu 's resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry - that it was n't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards - the Canadian version of the Oscars . 4/10 - and I 'm being a bit generous with that .
0 I 'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful , despite several good performances and generally competent acting - for - the - camera direction . It 's a first and last attempt by writer - director Soo Lyu . " Rub and Tug " ( 2002 ) is one of the unfortunate by - products of Canada 's program to promote home - grown film - making . While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like " New Waterford Girl " it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green - lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials . < br /><br />You do n't mind the low budget because the shabby production design , bad lighting , poor audio , and dreary docu - style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter ; the workers in Canadian massage parlors . But the dialogue and the plotting does n't give the actors anything to work with , the editor much to assemble , or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief . When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique ; even though nothing happens , the movie is hard to follow and point - of - view impossible to pin down . < br /><br />Don McKellar 's performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in " Exotica " . Lindy Booth 's Lea is her standard quirky airhead ; as always she is likable but here she is little else . Kira Clavell 's Cindy is a pleasant surprise , a kind of Asian Shelley Duval . The only other role of any consequence , Tara Spencer - Nairn 's street - wise Betty , more than cancels out her excellent performance in " New Waterford Girl " . Her shallow performance in " Rub and Tug " should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared ; unless you need further confirmation of " Waterford " director Alan Moyle 's skill in working with young actors . < br /><br />You quickly conclude that Lyu 's reptilian brain can not grasp concepts like plot complexity , so the need to insert a lazy and lame " deus ex machina " device toward the end is hardly a surprise . Still it could be worse , the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case . < br /><br />Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .
0 One of the silliest movies of the 1940s , an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser . Kyer , orchestra leader and radio - star ( and eternal college fraternity goof - off ) , was sort of the precursor to Spike Jones , hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians . He 's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion , the kind where poison darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall . The shindig is beset with a creepy judge , a scary professor , an ominous swami , lots of giggly females , and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures . The songs ( by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer ) are nothing to brag out , and neither is over - confident Kyser , yukking it up with elbow - in - the - ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years . * from * * * *
0 I knew my summary would get you . How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco ? ! Well , unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s , you probably ca n't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock ( and frankly , at least in the case of Pet Rocks , I STILL do n't understand it completely ) . They 're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation . The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band . At the time ( the 1940s mostly ) , they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff , Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film . Yet , if you did n't live at that time ( it was well before my time ) , you wonder why anyone liked this sort of " entertainment " . After all , Kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very , very broad ( i.e. , unsophisticated and cheesy ) . Frankly , I could n't stand their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film . Because of these factors , the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live . Once there , the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin . Eventually , it culminates in some attempts on Sally 's life and a séance ( of sorts ) . It 's all played for laughs -- and it 's really not a horror movie despite the cast.<br /><br />Overall , it 's passable entertainment at best . As a Lugosi and Karloff fan , I sure felt cheated having to watch Kyser and his knuckleheads .
0 Solid comedy entertainment , with musical interludes , it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications . Boris Karloff , Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy . The script contains all the standard mystery film props - sliding panels , secret passageways , thunder and lightning and poisoned blow - darts . Karloff , Lugosi and Lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era . Kay Kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940 's who were trying to forget about the horror 's of World War II .
0 Having heard so many people raving about this film I thought I 'd give it a go . Apart from being incredibly slow , which I do n't mind as long as the wait is worth it , but it just is n't . As many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just does n't ring true . The reaction of the 4 men switches from shock , horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish . Surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing , then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip .... why on earth tie the body to a tree , go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously ? Its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent . As for the rest of the townsfolk , well you 'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman ! The body itself , naked except for the knickers .... what scenario leads to that ? If she was raped then why still the knickers ? If she was raped with the clothes on , then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers ? If she was n't raped , then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers .... leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of ? I truly ca nt think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall ! Oh well its watchable but only just and only because , despite the poor script , the acting is strong .
0 Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable AND WORSE OF ALL a bizarre almost Hollywood - like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie ( this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends!).<br /><br />YOu will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones . The conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided . I did n't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner , is he / she trying to be racist?<br /><br />A truly bizare movie . Only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened.<br /><br />But on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent .
0 This is an abysmal piece of story - telling . It is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about ; the characters often mumble inaudibly ; actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other ; nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl ; a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens ; the Irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason ... to continue would be as boring as the movie itself . The only half - entertaining element is the landscape photography ; but anyone could point a camera at the Australian outback a get memorable shots . Overall - dreary , incoherent , pretentious - and downright annoying for wasting so much of the viewer 's time .
0 Stewart Kane ( Gabriel Byrne , VANITY FAIR ) heads out with his local Jindabyne , Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest , recreation , and relaxation . But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman 's body floating face - down in a river , things appear to have turned out for the worst . The largest casualty of the weekend is the men 's commonsense . They do n't hike out of the ravine , and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches . Then they head out and report the body.<br /><br />The town and the men 's lives quickly turn into a mess . The local media swarms them , and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives . Stewart 's wife Claire ( Laura Linney , THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE ) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did , but has to battle with it through her own mental illness.<br /><br />Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle , splayed out on a morgue slab . Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne : a division of men and women , black and white , social and outcast.<br /><br />The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids : Stewart and Claire 's son who is being led around by a half - breed Aussie who 's mother was killed also just a few years before . The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can , and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this ( again , the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised).<br /><br />Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface , yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around ( the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface ) . None , that is , until Claire forces them to.<br /><br />The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted . There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just does n't get done ; too many loose threads . The acting was okay , but the filming was terrible . Wobbly cameras , grainy or dark shots , and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production.<br /><br />I enjoy symbolic films , NORTHFORK being one of my all - time favorites in that vein . But Jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems , which simply did n't happen .
0 I love the 80s slasher flicks and I remember when " Silent Night / Deadly Night " was pulled from our theaters , I was very disappointed , so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net . You Better Watch Out was what I 've come to expect of these types of movies . The quality of the special effects were laughable by today 's standards , the character development too long , but all in all it was laugh out loud funny ! < br /><br />The scenes where he loses it because Santa , aka dad , is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting torches - not flashlights as you would in the 80s , but real torches ! - really tickled my funny bone . However , the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature . I also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were . It took me awhile to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear on Brothers .
0 This ( extremely)low - budget movie is compared to the great classic " Silent Night Deadly Night " , since it is labeled as a Slasher Flick . First let me say that I think that even " Silent Night Part 2 " is better than this ( that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie ) . " Christmas Evil " tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane,(a strong word ) , slowly ( very slowly ) . He is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work he ca n't stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love . Dressed up as Santa he finally goes on a killing spree . Also a strong word , since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects . No tension , no thrills , no gore , no cast . For one exception that is : Jeffrey DeMunn is in it . He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic " The Green Mile " . He still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role . He truly is the only one who really can act , his supporting role is better than the main lead . ( who also is n't that bad , but if you 're overshadowed by a little supporting character , you 're not great either . ) . And what about that strange ending ? ( you have to see it , to believe it ) . " Christmas Evil " is downright boring , nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading . This is not a slasher . You wanna see a real Christmas slasher , check out the all time greatest : " Silent Night , Deadly Night " .
0 The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh . I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies , but this just did n't qualify . It 's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity , which again , is n't a bad plot , but is done poorly here . There are some scenes ( such as the ending ) which are not intended to be funny , but actually made me laugh out loud . There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction , but it never fulfills what it could and should be . In my opinion , if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick , try Silent Night , Deadly Night .
0 What can possibly said about this movie other than , " viewer beware " . Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do , because this was harmful to my eyes and ears . I am rarely this unsatisfied with a " b " horror flick , but this movie could n't even bring a little scare to a five year old . The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he / she should seem almost god - like , like nothing can stop their maniacal rage , but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus , it 's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he 's far too stupid to be dangerous . All in all a total waste of film .
0 This is one of the worst B slashers I 've ever seen in my life . The ending is something you have to see to believe.<br /><br />The movie starts with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a Santa suit . He puts the presents under the tree , eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney . Phillip goes to bed but Harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a Santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother . Then , Harry goes up stairs , smashes a snow globe , grabs a shard of glass , and cuts himself.<br /><br />Then you move on to the present . You see Harry . He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars . He has two books . One book for good kids and the other for bad kids . He writes down everything they do in these books . The guy is a creep . He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory . His brother Phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house.<br /><br />When Harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits , he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids . Then , he travels to a church and kills 4 people . Then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree . The kids catch him but they go back to bed . So , Harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves.<br /><br />As he is walking towards a house , a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him . The parent 's are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they do n't get hurt . How do they know that Harry is the killer ? Sure , you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be . Harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids.<br /><br />When Harry runs off , the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him . They do n't even know that he is the killer . When Harry reaches his brother 's house , his his brother and him have a little talk and Phillip strangles him . He only loses consciousness . Phillip loads Harry back into his van . When Harry wakes up , he takes off.<br /><br />The ending is something I could not believe . Once again , you 'll have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />One thing that bugged me was the black Santa . That 's right , the man in the Santa suit they saw was a white man . So why did they bring in a black man?<br /><br />Skip this and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa 's Slay . You 'll get your money 's worth seeing those two films . They are better than this pile of garbage ! I give this movie 1 star out of 10 . Wish I could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves .
0 Depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this , " Christmas Evil " can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday - themed slashers ever made . Me , personally , I 'm tempted to opt for the latter because I did n't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80 's slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butchering people . Wrong ! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling ; who 's obsessed with Christmas , works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment . Harry 's issues all started when he witnessed Santa  his daddy in a costume obviously  caress his mommy 's naked legs at a tenderly young age . After that he just developed into a social outcast , much to the irritation of his younger brother , who 's bound to snap one ( holi)day . I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie , but did it really have to be so boring ? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens . I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed , but this movie does n't even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists ( with the notable exception of the finale , I must admit ) . Also , I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children ! He does n't and exclusively kills misbehaving adults . How are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa does n't even commit one miserable child murder ? THAT would have made " Christmas Evil " a classic , whereas now it 's just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk .
0 Why , oh , why wo n't they learn ? When you 've got a nice , juicy exploitation gimmick , use it ! Do n't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful ; you 're only gon na wind up looking foolish.<br /><br />Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling , who saw a little bit too much of Mommy kissing ( Daddy - dressed - as-)Santa Claus back when he was a kid . So , of course , Harry grows up obsessed with Christmas , and finally , when his disillusionment becomes too great , he flips out , dresses as Santa , and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children , and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.<br /><br />Simple enough , and not a bad place to start . ( After all , how many other holiday - themed horror flicks use the same schtick ? ) Unfortunately , this film wants to be more " Santa , Portrait of a Serial Killer " than " Silent Night , Deadly Night " . Two - thirds of the film are spent documenting Harry 's slow but inevitable breakdown , when I would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling . You know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.<br /><br />Perhaps Harry 's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director , but alas , we 've got some guy named Lewis Jackson . Apparently , this is his only film , and it shows . The action jumps giddily from scene to scene , without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.<br /><br />Even once the film gets rolling , we 're still treated to heaping helpings of Harry 's self - pity , insecurity , and neurotic behavior . More depressing than frightening , Christmas Evil is one to avoid .
0 Going into a movie like I this , I was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills ..... what I got was even less.<br /><br />Christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit . Horrified , he runs up the stairs and cuts himself . The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday joe ..... cept for the fact he 's obsessed with Santa . After his boss makes fun of him he goes insane , dressing up like santa and starts killing non - santa believing patrons and his boss . An unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they 're about to torch him , he drives his van off a cliff ..... into the moon . Not the best ending I 've seen but it was original.<br /><br />It was a slow paced , boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when Harry went apeshyt on the church goers . There was hardly any gore and even the " sex " scenes were toned down.<br /><br />Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
0 this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o ' crap i have ever watched.<br /><br />this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause . THAT IS WHY HE WENT INSANE ? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like EVER ? and that 's not the only thing . i 'm being serious when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMN MOVIE . nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by.<br /><br />there 's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him . IT 'S A FRIGGIN MINUTE LONG . WHO THE HELL WANTS TO SEE THAT ? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it . so if you see this movie on TV or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history . and i 'm serious about that.<br /><br />it 's not even so good its bad , it 's tedious , it 's idiotic , it made me want to break the vcr . it 's just not worth your time also i 'm sure every other review mentioned this but The actress who played the mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second . YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS ? I'D RATHER WATCH HOME IMPROVEMENT FOR SIXTY SIX HOURS THEN EVEN LOOK AT THIS MOVIES COVER EVER AGAIN .
0 Stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out Santa is n't real ( ? ? ? ) . He grows up and becomes an adult ( Brandon Maggart ) who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice . One Christmas he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people -- dressed as Santa of course.<br /><br />Boring and just plain bad killer Santa movie . If you 're looking for gore , it 's not here . Only a few of the murders are shown and they 're not that gory with VERY fake effects . Most of the movie just contains Brandon Maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy . The script is trite , the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack - jawed at the TV . Seriously , I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I was n't hallucinating ! Really REALLY poor ending.<br /><br />If you want a scary Christmas flick rent " Black Christmas " ( the original 70s version --- NOT the terrible remake ) . Avoid this one at all costs .
0 No , I 've never seen any of the " Santa Slasher " series , i.e. ' Silent Night , Deadly Night , ' the original ' Black Christmas ' or this one , ' Christmas Evil . ' I 've heard all about their reputation , or , MADS ( Mothers Against Deranged Santas . ) I thought I would rent this one as I 've heard it pop up as a reference on a ' Fat Guys At the Movies ' segment.<br /><br />Mothers should be against this , but not for the ooooohhhh " killer " Santa , but for the fact this movie was just plain crap . Boring , long  even at only 92 minutes , crap.<br /><br />Little boy sees Santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 , deliver presents , eat some goodies and miraculously , float up the chimney . Boy goes to bed , but returns to living room to witness Mommy and Santa ( sort of ) getting it on . Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life , though the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphie 's dad got the " Leg Lamp " in ' A Christmas Story . ' He was sooo disturbed , he went to the attic and , well cut his own hand.<br /><br />Fast forward to the future ! Now , it 's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory . We get a whiff of him being a little off - kilter , and he stalks both kids and parents alike . Who 's naughty , who 's nice , blah blah . It takes a good two - thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that 's not foreshadowed from frame one . NO MOVIE should take that long.<br /><br />I will admit , this movie had its tension building , but only because I kept expecting him to do something , anything to anyone . When he finally does , well , punish " who 's naughty , " it 's as graphic as a " Garbage Pail Kid " card . And I have n't mentioned the WTF ending . I 'm thinking it was a metaphor , but in reality , it 's just as weird as the rest of the movie . ( Take the brother who 's upset his sibling is killing , and his solution is  uh , killing . ) Do n't open this mess , even on Christmas Eve , or Evil . Again , I did n't watch the other " Santa - Slashers " but this one sucked bad . It built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present .
0 I saw mommy ... well , she was n't exactly kissing Santa Clause ; he has his hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mind.<br /><br />This was enough to emotionally scar a young boy who wanted to believe . He grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made , and the lack of Christmas spirit.<br /><br />Expecting a real slasher flick , I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies , and there was no nudity at all . What a bummer.<br /><br />I wanted to like this flick , but it was just too slow and really did n't have a good script . I did n't expect great acting , but I sure wanted some action . There just was n't any .
0 Yes , I am just going to tell you about this one so do n't read if you want surprises . I got this one with the title Christmas Evil . There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night , Bloody Night . Whereas Silent Night , Bloody Night ( not to be confused with Silent Night , Deadly Night ) had lots of potential and was very close to being good , this one was n't quite as good . It started out interesting enough watching the villain ( if you can call him that ) watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice , but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie does n't deliver . You need character development , but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps . About an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror , and the guys he kills are n't even his targets they are just making fun of him . This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty . He then proceeds to try and kill this other guy , and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace . He promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out . He then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom . He ca n't seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat . What the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place ? Oh yeah , the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too . Well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play . What was that even about ? He kept talking about something that was never really explained . How does it end you ask , well since I have spoilers I will tell you . He runs off the road in his van and proceeds to , well lets just say it was lame ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 This movie is not that interesting , except for the first ten minutes . The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece , even better than say Gosford Park . Then it inexplicably slows down , loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine ( Depardieu ) and Cécile ( Deneuve ) . In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story , several threads started are not ended.<br /><br />*******SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and Cécile . He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago , despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco . As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of Cécile 's marriage . Having accomplished this , he is buried after a freak accident ( literally ) and becomes a comatose . He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they 've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together . * * * * * * * END OF SPOILERS < br /><br />It remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here : Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe , there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraq 's former regime . Cécile 's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs ( loyalty ) once he meets his boyfriend , whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick ( of that ? ) . Her sister is traditional Islamic , and enters a relation with Cécile 's husband . It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward , despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past . It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism , which may sometimes be true , but certainly not in general . In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art.<br /><br />Deneuve and Depardieu are great . With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene : lifting an eyebrow , body language , radiating pride , awkward behavior . The movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays . With some notable exceptions of course .
0 Ok I will sum up this movie ... A bunch of skanky British women have some disease that basically is turning them into zombies . The whole movie consists of these women talking , smoking , and rarely going out for " meat " Or humans to eat . I swear I had to MAKE myself watch this movie ... UGH
0 Unfortunately , the realism is boring . This movie , I thought it would never end , would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes . Where 's Blade when you need him ? While as dismal as COMBAT SHOCK , REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI , DEAD CREATURES is n't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies . While the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe Jeffery Dalmers hearts race a little faster , it was n't nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS . Really , I found it about as interesting as late - night infomercials , and as exciting as a trip to the dentist . If you have strong masochistic qualities , you might be able to endure this , otherwise , for no one . I was really surprised that this one was n't made by the people at Brain Damage as that was the quality of Dead Creatures .
0 SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched half of this movie and I did n't like it . < br /><br />First reason : Boring . Barely anything happens , the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope , they smoke weed , read magazines , care for their sick friend , and cut up the occasional dead body . BORING!!!!<br /><br />Second reason : There are too many things left unexplained . Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men , restrains them in a chair and interrogates them . Who are these men ? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters ? Why does he kill one and let another one go?<br /><br />Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he 's not quite what we originally thought - never explained ! How frustrating is that ? < br /><br />Conclusion : I found the women annoying , the story uninteresting , the duologue tedious , and the action non - existent . Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly is n't . I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website , and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick , I will from now on make sure I read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie I regret seeing .
0 This movie is one of those I regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that I 'll never get back in . The premise is really interesting - essentially it 's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead ( let 's not split hairs as to whether they 're actually dead or not}. Unfortunately , they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework . The nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film , but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it . If they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged , it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary .
0 A bunch of women who ca n't act sit around , talk , smoke pot . They have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed , and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store - bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers . We do n't see them killing anyone , suddenly there is a body on the floor , covered by a bloodied sheet . I ca n't eat Spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this . Just the thought of Spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie . Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is " hunting " them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement . Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sit - On - The - Couch Sisters is never explained . There are also scenes of some " superhuman " guy freaking out . He p***es blood and punches through a wall , but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story.<br /><br />There is no action , no special effects , no story . If you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking , then here 's 90 minutes of that , because , except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes , absolutely NOTHING happens . ( YAWN ) Oh , I almost forgot , you get to see them move some stuff , including the deformed sister , when they move to their new apartment . Its one of the few times they 're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed .
0 " ASTONISHING " Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box . They must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released . The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals , and murder innocent people just to stay alive . Their skin peels off throughout the film , we also see severed legs , heads etc that are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set . There is an awful lot of talking b*ll**ks , a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair , before stabbing them in the head , chopping them into bits ... <br /><br />You get the picture . Considering there is no acting talent on display at all , and the gore is laughably unrealistic , what is the point of this whole farrago ? Again looking at the video box , the guy responsible for it is an " underground cult director " . Would that be like those weird religious cults where they brainwash you into thinking one way when clearly the opposite is true ? Because that 's the only possible reason I can think of for anyone to derive pleasure by watching this tax write - off . Then , on the same paragraph he compares himself to Mike Leigh , Ken Loach and George Romero . HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it . Now you 're just being silly.<br /><br />Do you enjoy this film ? Are you offended by the above opinion ? If so , you must be a member of said cult . Do they pocket your wages ? Do they let you see other family members ? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson films till you think he 's the best director since A.Hitchcock ? Do tell ... this sounds like a Panorama special brewing to me . And say hello to the critic of the LA times when you return to your colony , will you ? 0/10
0 I chose " Dead Creatures " because I thought it was a zombies movie just like " 28 days " or so ... but not at all . It is n't even a horror movie . Nothing happens , except for a group of women that seem to have been infected by a strange virus that make her to eat human flesh in order to survive . < br /><br />That plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /><br />Very VERY BAD MOVIE.<br /><br />*My rate : 2/10<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />------------------
0 How did this ripoff of " Being There " ever get to be so loved ? People say it 's proof that a decent , honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence . They 're wrong . The movie is proof that luck is everything : hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not Atari ; hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks ; hope that you do n't die of shock when you 're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back ; hope you do n't get AIDS from your wife . This movie is also politically reactionary -- all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs , do drugs , beat their girlfriends , or die young . In addition , the product placement in this film ( Nike and Dr. Pepper ) is shameless . An emotionally manipulative film that is very , very empty .
0 The first half of the film is OK , the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable . Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time . " Pulp Fiction " was robbed for " Best Picture . " This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is " slow . "
0 Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar - worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt . Dan . < br /><br />Tom Hanks is a one - trick pony in this movie , how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime . < br /><br />This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation , with a barely concealed right - wing prejudice , beginning from Forrest 's service in Vietnam all the way through to the " resolution " with Jenny at the end.<br /><br />With that said , though , it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through . I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive , Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.<br /><br />Watch this film and ask yourself " What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American ? " < br /><br />Forrest seems to have made the " right " choices and been at the " right place at the right time " for the last 45 years . Those who are wrong according to the director 's vision seem to pay a heavy price . So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic , even AMERICAN quality ?
0 I loved " Anchorman ; The Legend of Ron Burgundy " and hoped this would be just as funny , but alas , it was n't . Some bits are excellent though . I thought the sports guy , Champ Kind , professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious . Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which does n't get acknowledged either . But on the whole the story does n't gel . It 's a noble attempt , however , to salvage the unused bits from the first movie , including an entire plot about some pretty benign would - be domestic terrorists called " The Alarm Clock . " Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines , but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie . The extras on this disk are pretty good , with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy , and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an " exec producer " who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way , shape or form . Turns out he 's " just a guy " who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer . It 's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
0 Look , I loved the PROPER Anchorman film , but this was reaaaaallly bad . The kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life , the kind of bad that makes you think " what on Earth were they thinking to film this in the first place " , the kind of bad that makes you wish you 'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film , the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun , the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a Pauly Shore film instead .... seriously , I can not explain how very bad this was.<br /><br />Having said that .... there were some semi - amusing laughs , but they are all so much LESS funny than Anchorman . Sure , they tried to make it entertaining and fun , but the entire subplot that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason ... it was n't even a little bit good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour ( or in the USA , a favor ) , and do n't watch this DVD ... it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you do n't want to do that.<br /><br />Okay ... I'm alright now .
0 Pieced ( edited ) together from dead body parts ( deleted scenes ) from corpses ( Anchorman ) , the Frankenstein Monster ( Wake Up , Ron Burgundy ) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes ( something you 'd ever want to watch twice ..... maybe even once for that matter.)<br /><br />More often than not -the relativity of the scenes in WURB are made relevant by a third person narrator . Even more troubling is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman ( in opening narration we 're told WURB takes place shortly after the original . ) At the end of Anchorman , Burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co - anchorwoman / lover . In this film , he 's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to Veronica ( quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman spliced in to WURB . ) < br /><br />The part that makes this a movie , a continually evolving story , involves a bank - robbing clan without a cause called the Alarm Clock . These scenes are almost painful to sit through . This part was scrapped from the original scripts for Anchorman.<br /><br />The majority of other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate / deleted takes on scenes from Anchorman . They go to the same party as in the original , the same original " group bitching about having a woman on the team " scene , and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica had objections to reporting.<br /><br />Burgundy re - creates their first date with the drive - in spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club , Tinos . Neither character make mention that they 've been to the drive - in spot before and when Burgundy walks into Tinos with Veronica , he introduces it to her as though they 've never been before . Oh , and they 're wearing the same clothes as on their original date.<br /><br />Still , I have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if WURB is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration . Between the two Ron Burgundy stories - this is the weaker one . Looking back on it , it 's quite a feat for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB . You stay classy , IMDb . Thanks for stopping by .
0 A collection of Deleted scenes and alternative takes , edited together and with added voice - over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first . Pretty cool idea , but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof . As it 's just not as funny as " Anchorman " , and really let 's face it THAT film was n't exactly comedy gold either , so you get a ' movie ' worse than one that was moderately funny . In my eyes that STILL puts it one or two notches above " Kicking and Screaming " , or " Bewitched " . Chross your fingers that " The Wedding Crashers " is a return to old school form ( no pun intended ) < br /><br />My Grade : D
0 Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni , who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of Zola . Muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it . He was a giant in the business for at least a decade . He could have won the Academy Award for this performance , which would have given him two in a row , as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before . My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit , I still think he was one of the great actors of the " Golden Age . " Whatever part he played ; you were riveted to the screen watching him.<br /><br />Unlike the Pasteur role , I thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we 've seen in the last 60 years : going overboard to make a Liberal hero . Even in 1937 , Hollywood could n't suppress its disdain for police or for the military , here making it a point to tell us how " corrupt " those organizations are . Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated . In that regard , this film is way ahead of its day since we 've seen this big - time since the 1960s.<br /><br />However , it must be noted the facts support this story . It also does not in any way diminish Zola 's accomplishments as a social reformer , getting rid of certain evils . Good for him ! I wish they had spent more time showing that , than concentrating on one trial .
0 I like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story . This does n't occur in this movie . It 's a series of vignettes with no cohesion.<br /><br />There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans . A woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses . This woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why . She disappears completely after about 30 minutes . There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man 's apartment . There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas ' California Dreaming ' is vastly overplayed ( I used to like the song ) . The dialogue is mostly concerned with food ( pineapples , chef 's salad and ordering drinks  ) . I assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed.<br /><br />There is no passion in this movie because there is no story . This is purportedly a romance - it is no such thing . I just wonder why I did n't hit the Fast - forward . I kept waiting for something significant to happen  it does n't . Maybe that 's the only consolation to this movie - scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense .
0 A never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film . The " Blonde Wig " half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self - indulgence by its makers.<br /><br / > The Wong Faye half ( featuring a very playful , if Karen Carpenter looking , Faye Wong ) holds much more appeal . All the ingredients are there , however , the girl - meets - boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness . Character development is uneven . Emotion is missing.<br /><br / > For music lovers , Wong Faye 's " Mung Jung Yun " ( Cantonese version of the Cranberry 's smash hit " Dreams " ) is used effectively in Chungking Express . Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called " Zhen Tuo . " Both are on CD , although only " Mung Jung Yun " is found on the official movie soundtrack CD .
0 Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass . It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another , but never coalesce into a totality.<br /><br />While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking , it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon . An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar - wai Wong and Tarantino , but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over . The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values , and them there just ai n't going to cut it all by themselfs.<br /><br />This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes . Sorry . The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir . I get the same big yawn and let - down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible . Ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun.<br /><br />Call me a philistine roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey.<br /><br / >
0 I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie . The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantino 's seeming insane obsession for it ... There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality . Overall however , I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous . The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying , even sickening . Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents.<br /><br />The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and " conclusions . " A depressing movie ( not a true _ film _ , a term I reserve for true art ) that left me with a bad feeling . Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a " romantic comedy " though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content , form , and conclusion any association with this genre.<br /><br />I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources .
0 I am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked , let alone held in such high regard , especially by so many critics who are , otherwise , quite sensible.<br /><br />There is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.<br /><br />The most easily explained example of this is the director 's use - or , more accurately , abuse - of music . In the first half , a really dull reggae tune is played about three times ( when once is too often ) . But in the second half , The Mommas And The Papas " California Dreamin ' " is played at least seven times , usually at top volume . Godsakes , whether you liked the song or not beforehand , you 'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end . Just think , some people claim to have seen this film four or five times . This means they 've listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... <br /><br />All of this needless hyper - repetition ( it contributes nothing to the story ) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit , or if the story was in any way involving.<br /><br />But it ain't.<br /><br />The only aspect I found likeable was Bridgette Lin 's charging around and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies . Even this wore off fairly quickly.<br /><br />I'm sure this film 's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it.<br /><br />I can only warn you - if you 've never seen a HK movie before , do n't start with this one.<br /><br />If you feel compelled to watch it , avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema . The fast - forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here.<br /><br />You have been warned !
0 For those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight , I first offer these four words : Do n't waste your time ! " Chungking Express " was shoddily filmed , slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King . I ca n't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one - dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane ! It 's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog ( a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that " tears can be dried with a tissue , but water takes time to mop up " ) . The same character is also seen carrying on a deep , meaningful rapport with his towels , soap , stuffed animals , dirty laundry , etc . The shaky , wandering , hand - held camera - work was another annoying feature I could have done without . And if that is n't enough to make you puke in your popcorn , we hear the old 60 's ode " California Dreaming " by the Mamas and Papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company , though I can not for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother . He was known to have remarked , " I 'm happy to love a movie this much . " A lot of us , though , hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future .
0 This film is another example of the curse of east Asian cinema : two or more separate stories rolled into one film . Other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the " first part " and " second part " . How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time ? I was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped ( it did n't " end " , it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story ) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy 's apartment ( wow ! ) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent script to work with !
0 Be warned ! < br /><br />This is crap that other crap wo n't even deign to be in company with because it 's beneath them ! Okay , got that out of the way , let me say something more substantive.<br /><br />I've seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director , Wong Kar Wai . Well , despite of all of that WKW has n't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans ; mostly it is just shots of dripping water , beads of sweats , legs of horses running , etc . I could n't sit through most of the movie.<br /><br />Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong 's movies another shot after hearing many praises , especially from Cannes . I was intrigued by his latest , 2046 . A friend told me to start w/ Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies . So wrong ! I was just p.o . that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness . Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city , blah , blah , blah . It 's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it . But no , he merely shows what is . Faye Wong 's acting is very typical of Hong Kong 's style : garbled enunciation , deer in the headlight wide eye expression , try to be cute and girlish kind of acting ; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired.<br /><br />I think the word , Auteur , is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different , which is to be applauded , but not one who has n't yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling , which is what Mr. Wong is , for the last 17 years !
0 I saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it . I 've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half . Personally , I enjoyed the first story ( too bad that was n't extended . ) The second story , I thought , was cliched . And that " California Dreaming , " if I hear that one more time ... Chungking Express is alright , but it 's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see , like " Crouching Tiger . "
0 i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds . every time that you think it can not get any worse , it inevitably does . The acting is absolutely horrific . the plot makes no sense at all . The title " cold vengeance " in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script . The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take . There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable . I can not remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones -- well , except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes . No , who am I kidding , while a bad one , Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap .
0 What a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low - key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you 're left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion . Unfortunately , this is what happened to me by the end of WHITE NOISE.<br /><br />It was n't Michael Keaton 's fault ; it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again , looking a bit wrinkled perhaps , but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance . As a man whose wife has recently died , he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife ( not a new idea ) , apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there 's nothing being broadcast.<br /><br />The idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called EVP ( Electronic Voice Phenomena ) and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real , so I 'm not going to make any comments about what I think of that , or them . Let me just say that I 'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this , but what I ca n't tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place , which is about where I was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll . Much static indeed.<br /><br />There are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled , but if a film fails to make itself clear for me , I tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker , not my own ( unless I watched it while I was too tired to focus or something ) . Well , for WHITE NOISE I was wide awake , bright - eyed and bushy - tailed -- so guess who 's to blame ?
0 I first heard about White Noise when I saw the TV advert . Before then I did n't even know it existed . I watched the trailer online and decided that I would go and see it . Now being a fan of films like The Sixth Sense , I thought that this film would give me everything I wanted . It has Michael Keaton in it , and he rocks . Unfortunately the film did not deliver . It tried to be another Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes , and failed miserably . It has a very promising start , but the middle just drags on repeating itself , and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out . Unfortunately like most " Scary " films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump . This film could have been so much more . It 's a shame because it was a good idea .
0 Absolutely one of the worst movies of the year . The plot is ridiculous , the characters poorly developed , and the premise irritatingly stupid . It all begins when Michael Keaton , fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman , loses his beautiful author wife , Anna , to a car accident , possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she 's supposed to be rich . In his grief , Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby : recording nothing and then watching it . He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his TV . Pretty soon , he starts to see dead people , thanks to EVP , or Electronic Voice Phenomenon , which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders , video cameras , dead cell phones ( " Anna cell calling ? But she's ... DEAD! ... Must be ghosts . Mhmmm . No other possible explanation . I 'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately . " ) etc . Why they ca n't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained . ANyway , eventually Batman discovers that he 's actually seeing the future , and he decides to go help this woman he does n't know . He gets out of his house just in the nick of time , because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves ( " D*mn it ! Can travel between the living and dead using electronics , but I 'll be d*mned if we can be on time ! Am I right guys ? ( They nod in bemused agreement ) . " ) . He tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie ( look hard , or you 'll miss him ! ) is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons , who in Raiders of the Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him , looking like the cartoons that they are . Just then some detectives show up and save the lady . After Batman 's funeral , he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot , evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it . The little kid just smiles . Nothing phases that dude , not even when his dad , Batman of course , starts talking to TV 's . The high - point of the movie was when someone 's phone rang and some guy yelled out , " It 's Anna ! "
0 I frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market , and sadly White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor . I was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static - induced headache increased . I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief . Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton , I was totally unaffected by his demise . Up until the credits I diligently awaited for something -- anything-- of substance to connect me to the characters ' story , but such relief never came . Sure , there were the occasional heart - stopper moments , but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer.<br /><br />While the acting was lame , Michael Keaton may have played his studliest role to date . Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton 's abodes . Overall , White Noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows , contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves .
0 The idea was awesome , the actors were incredible , the story could of been very scary , but the writing was poor and there was no depth . I could n't really get into this movie . I could n't feel for the characters , there were a lot of cliffhangers , and the movie just ends very weirdly . Was it a happy ending ? I do n't know . Was it a sad ending ? Again , I do n't know . You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied . The movie had so much to give , but could n't . Just because you can edit , does n't mean you should , right ? I would n't really recommend this movie because you just ca n't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed . You 'll just be confused . Trust me , you will probably thank me if you do n't watch this movie.<br /><br />3/10
0 I do n't think I 've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap . NOTHING in it makes any sense . none of it is clever or well thought out . out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop - out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing 's there . that s OK to do once , maybe , but i counted three times . there are things thrown in for no apparent reason , characters , half - formed story lines .... the characters were n't well developed at ALL . the ending was .. bad . bad , bad , bad , everything , every component , of this film is terrible . and I 'm just here to warn you all of that .
0 John Rivers ' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car . During the days she has been missing , he confronts a man that 's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other - side through E.V.P - Electronic Voice Phenomenon . Naturally he does n't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about E.V.P. Soon enough John is hooked onto it , but something supernatural does n't like him interfering with the dead , as now other then contacting his wife , the white noise is foretelling events before they happen.<br /><br />Since this DVD has been sitting on my shelf for a while now , I thought I better get around to watching it since it was n't my copy . But then again I do n't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back , as they have n't question me about it . Oh well . So I decided to give it a play , as I was in an undemanding mood . After hearing and reading all the bad press on it , I was n't expecting anything remotely good , but I was kept entertained for 90 minutes . Well , more so the 60 minutes , as the last half - an - hour was pretty much a blur of confusion . The film is nowhere as good as it could have been , but the time breezed by quick enough even though it 's a rather tepid supernatural thriller . I thought it was n't all a waste . The first hour I found some effective sequences rather interesting and there 's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you , but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film . That 's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just does n't fit in with the context . It becomes rather hectic , loud and very muddled with its MTV style editing and kinetic camera - work that gets to close into the action . I could n't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax . The whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey . It 's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big , but hits rock bottom . I thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera - work . Other then the distinctively stark lighting , the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy . All of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware , which makes it come across as very sterile and empty.<br /><br />You can easily see that the film 's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story . There 's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material . After a while , it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood - curdling stuff from beyond the grave . It just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy TV screen after while . The E.V.P machine was the star on the show . Well , it did have more impact than the limp performances . Michael Keaton is more than capable actor , but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed John Rivers . He really deserves much better , though . Everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable . Not because of the performances , but of the lack of depth in their characters . This clunker was n't bad to begin with , but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically.<br /><br />I would n't care to see it again and I would n't recommend to anyone , unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of Hollywood produced horror / thrillers . It 's just a damn shame that this over - produced flick could n't put it together successfully , as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand . I did n't hate it , but what a disappointment .
0 I saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release , and MAN , did it look scary , Especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon . I was incredibly interested , and thought that this could finally be a decent horror / thriller film after years if crap . Well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is : maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements . The advertisements for the movie did both , which lead to my ultimate disappointment.<br /><br />By no means is this " the most disturbing movie in years " . Hell , I doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that week 's release . This movie takes the whole " based off of fact " thing too far.<br /><br />This movie was n't complete crap . I must admit , it held my interest and Micheal Keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means . Other than that , though , this film is one big cliché . After John 's wife dies , he learns about EVP , which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances . He all of the sudden receives messages from his wife ! My God ! It 's not just his wife reaching him , it 's other dead people . Gee , imagine that . A movie about helping dead people . Come on , give me a break ! The clichés do n't stop there . There 's also the obligatory clock - stopping - at - the - same - exact - time - every - night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero . Not only was the movie cliché , it WASN'T SCARY . The film literally had two jump scenes , and those two scenes are almost identical . The ending is horrible , as it leaves the door WIDE OPEN for a sequel . There 's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of X voices heard through EVP are threatening , with a nice happy tune playing . Way to break the mood , you guys . Jeez ! In the end , if you want another forgettable horror film , see White Noise . The only reasons I could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a Keaton fan or that they are interested in EVP . Sure , the EVP aspects may be slightly interesting , but I do n't like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face . This film tries to be scary , original , and disturbing , but it 's just the opposite . You know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film . " I WILL SEE THIS FILM NO MORE . "
0 Jonathan Rivers ( Michael Keaton ) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies . Soon after , he 's approached by a Dr. Price , an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena ( EVP ) , who claims he 's been receiving messages from Jonathan 's departed wife Anna via sundry electronic gadgets . Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something ? Is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale ? It 's good to see Keaton in a leading role , but the story he 's stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points ; it 's as if the movie does n't know how to answer any of the questions it brings up , so it just distracts the viewer with new , unrelated questions.<br /><br />Keaton himself is pretty good , convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife . He 's matured quite a bit as an actor , leaving behind the frat - friendly waacky - hijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier . He looks a little craggy , with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect , but he 's lost none of the guile and panache that he 's shown during his quarter century in Hollywood.<br /><br />So it 's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance , it 's that the script itself is subpar . Written by Niall Johnson , the plot gets more confusing as it progresses , each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path . This is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement , something that ties more or less everything together and explains ... something . But not White Noise ; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I 'd first seen him.<br /><br />Keaton 's really the only reason to watch this junk , although he gets fine support from Ian McNeice ( as Dr. Price ) and Deborah Kara Unger as the requisite love interest .
0 As a cinema fan White Noise was an utter disappointment , as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good , nicely lit , good camera work , reasonable direction . But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other ' so called ' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with . Although it did have a little bit of the ' chill factor ' the whole concept of the E.V.O ( Electronic Voice Phenomena ) did'not seem believable . This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them . The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion , like many recent thriller / horror movies.<br /><br />Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it .
0 " White Noise " had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since " The Exorcist " I think . Seeing as EVP is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact . Not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people . Like I said this movie could have , but did not . The movie degraded itself to a low class PG-13 scary movie . Nothing compared to " The Ring " or " The Sixth Sense " by any means . Someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think , but it makes us jump , scream , everything a horror movie should do . I 'm honestly sick of the PG-13 Horror Genre , because its becoming a genre of its own . We need the old days back , the blood and gore days , the Freddy Kruger , the Jason , The Mike Myers days . Few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so NOT scary . So why try to pull it off ? A few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all ... don't waste your money on this movie .
0 Okay , I struggled to set aside the fact that in selling EVP as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get - go . I reasoned that hell , I do n't believe in vampires but I still liked Dracula so I could live with this.<br /><br />However , even with that accepted the movie is just not very good . It 's competently made and acted , but it does n't really capture you at all . There are several " jump " moments , and I just looked at them and thought " yeah , I did n't expect that " without actually jumping in the slightest.<br /><br />Also the resolution does n't make sense . If the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be , then why the hell does it need to use a proxy ? Plus , the end caption was absurd . They obviously put it there as part of the " give the movie credibility by claiming it 's all real " thing , but for that to work it really needs to be at the start . But they ca n't put it at the start because then they give the plot away ... sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb .
0 Michael Keaton has really never been a good actor ; in the Tim Burton Batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains . Here , he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living ... <br /><br />Well , this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller , but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you . Because there 's way too much stuff that ends up unexplained , undiscovered and uninteresting . So where 's the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that WHITE NOISE makes a fool out of itself ? Truly bad acting and horrifying edited , this movie is nothing to watch . Michael Keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever .
0 LOC could have been a very well made movie on how the Kargil war was fought ; it had the locations , the budget , and the skill to have been India 's " Saving Private Ryan " or " Black Hawk Down " . Instead it come across as a bloated , 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie . Even the war scenes were terribly executed , using the same hill in all their battle scenes , and spending unnecessary time on casual talk . Instead of trying to appeal to the indian public , a better movie would have been a to - the - book account of what happened at Kargil ( like " Black Hawk Down " ) or even spending time on the militant point of view ( like " Tora , Tora , Tora " ) . Even better , it could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write , direct and edit the film . Until then , I 'd like to see some one re - edit this film , with only the pertinent portions included ; it would make the movie more watchable .
0 Storyline : The film spanning 4-odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and had entered deep into the Indian territory and the Indian Retaliation . To know more about the story , I would suggest readers to read the news - items pertaining to Kargil.<br /><br />Comment : If one is looking for a formula story in this movie , then one can be sure that it is absent . LOC is a story of Pure sacrifice , patriotism , courage and lots and lots of bullets and Blood . The movie hall where I saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the Film shows Indian Bravery . Movie audience seemed similar to Audiences like in an India vs Pak cricket match.<br /><br />Watch the movie as a tribute to the Army 's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real - life war heroes ( 4 PVC honoured heroes ) who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day . The movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the Army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions . The film 's negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring .
0 If you have seen very less films , this might be a big one for you . If you have seen lot of films , this is a joke . The acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly . Not to mention , there are songs , there are lot of flashbacks , and most importantly , the fighting scenes are stupidily performed . New characters , good direction , would have done a better job , but since it contains all the bollywood heros / heroines , you can predict what s going to happen next . You do not feel sad when something happens , the emotions they protray is terrible , mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies . It suppose to be a realistic movie , but it fails to show . There are times you wondering , you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them . Are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid ? There were only a few characters acting that was very good , but as far it is concerned with plot , action , it is poorly directed . This movie could have been short if they took out songs , flashbacks , stick to the point .
0 There 's nothing new for me to say : 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill . The cast was stellar , but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God goofed . He should have eaten humble pie ( if not for his own sake then for the men who died in Kargil ) , hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors , hired a real scriptwriter , hired a real editor , hired a musician that was n't related to him in some way ( and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of " Apocalypse Now " on some cheap Indian drug ) , hired a real professional crew , thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story . Unfortunately he , like the bigwigs of the Indian Army , made decisions that were terrible for his actors , and terrible for his audience . We all died over and over . < br /><br />Please do n't do that again , Sir ! Sushma Kathmandu , Nepal < br /><br />ps : Next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment , I suggest he hire more than one Nepali to represent the team . Surely there are plenty of Nepali men working in Bombay -- last count was 40,000 to half a million .
0 Okay , I was bored and decided to see this movie . But I think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage , then basically that same hour repeated 4 times . It consists of 1 . Gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan , 2 . Flashbacks to the men 's wives 3 . The approach of the troops marching in a long line 4 . Men running up hill and shooting , usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him . 5 . Defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 . Men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs . That was the basic movie , and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times . and every time it did a flashback to the wives , it would show the man , then his wife and him . There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time . Other than that , the men could n't kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades . I liked the music and there was a lot of action , though the action was repetitive . Overall , I probably would n't see it again , but it was n't too horrible .
0 This film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure It had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN(2002 ) i guess no one had the guts to do something like that < br /><br />The film as the title suggests is based on the Kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring < br /><br />Even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes , wonder which soldier does that?<br /><br />Direction by JP Dutta pales front of BORDER Music is okay < br /><br />Amongst the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands tall , Saif is very good in his part and also it 's his first film with kareena , Abhishek is likable Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted , Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna does his part well rest are passable Rani is good , Esha is okay rest are passable
0 This was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friends . But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish , I knew I could n't even watch the damn thing to close . You are almost convinced the actual war did n't even last that long . Other 's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this . But flat out , you ca n't go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC . Forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - those do n't preclude a director from making an intelligent movie . The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names . I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard . The character development sequences ( the soilders ' flashbacks , looking back to their last moments , before being deployed ) should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory . To this day , I have yet to watch the ending . But there was a much better movie ( not saying much ) called Border .
0 Now please do n't start calling me names like , " unpatriotic " , " weirdo " and more .<br /><br />The very length of this movie ( 4 hours .. ! ! ! ) is its biggest mistake . No editing at all - seems like J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much . Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and gave a message as well .<br /><br />It 's based on true incidents and real people . Kudos to it , but were the repetitive war scenes really needed ? On top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all .<br /><br />Between the skirmishes , there were songs about loneliness , lovesickness and related stuff . There were chummy conversations . In the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk .<br /><br />Why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle , fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near ? And when they were shot , it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place .<br /><br />Music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie . Better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie .<br /><br />Acting was the saving grace : From seasoned veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan , to relative newbies like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna , everyone acted like a pro . Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary .<br /><br />Dialogues ranged from brilliant ( " From Madhuri .. with Love ! ! " ) to illogical / monotonous ( " Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain " ) . And the expletive spree consisting of all the MCs , BCs , Cs and F - words was n't really required . < br /><br />LOC Kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave Indian soldiers , but tries too hard and ultimately fails . Indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute .
0 Is this the movie ? ? ? Is this what Indians are trying to show ? ? I think this is one more effort from a sick - minded director to turn down Pakistani soldiers and in fact country .... but what we Pakistani 's know that we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... not only in armed counters.<br /><br />Well ... this is bad filmed as that of Border in early 1997 ... and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in Kargil by Pakistani armed forces , by creating films like these .. <br /><br />One thing is very clear ... Whenever there will be an encounter between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... ! ! ! So Mr. Dutta try to make some good movies instead of Nonsense movies like this
0 I should put out an alert all over saying that the movie should n't be watched . It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men . The special effect were horrible , I had n't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology . How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed ? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them ? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away ? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?<br /><br />Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me , it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder . There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai , ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai . Stupid to say the least.<br /><br />What Shobha De had written is true . The director worked without a script and it shows . There is no flow to the movie . There is no gradual progression from one battle to another . It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war . The explanatory scenes are awful . The chief of army staff looks unconvincing . To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours .
0 I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day . The quick summary of this movie is MUST AVOID . JP Dutta wrote , directed , produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of the attempt by Pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of Kashmir from India . Supposedly based on fact , you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area from the Pakistani troops - who occupied the high ground . But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story , all this movie does is make the Indian military look laughable and stupid , which I know is not true.<br /><br />I watched this movie with an almost completely Indian audience , who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie , but also found themselves laughing at scenes that were n't meant to be funny.<br /><br />The script was absolutely abysmal . It gave the impression that Mr Dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference . The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive.<br /><br />The acting from most of the principals was not stellar , but considering the script they were given , I find it hard to criticise them too much . As for the supporting cast , all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs.<br /><br />The editing was also pretty bad . It was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time , and music would abruptly end at scene changes.<br /><br />Good things : The cinematography was pretty good , although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie did n't appear to be colour corrected ( the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes ) . Also , the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable - for the first half a dozen or so verses at least . Unfortunately they went on a LOT longer than they should have.<br /><br />And the worst crime of all ? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG . There is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 - 2 hour movie out of what was shot . Sadly , a good editor was not working on this movie .
0 This movie was absolute torture . First of all , it 's a whopping 4 + hours long ! True , the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for , but every single one of those battles need not have been shown . So maybe this is a documentary , not a commercial film as advertised . Sure did n't seem like it , as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws . The battle sequences were so poorly executed . I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border . Each battle was the exact same as the previous . It was so predictable . ( This might be a spoiler . ) The whole army marches uphill , five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each ( they also use the same cussword every time ) , one of the lead actors is shot , someone yells for a stretcher , the actor says , " No , do n't get a stretcher . That will take 6 men from the battalion , " and then an actor dies . That exact same thing happens over and over and over again . Oh , and the songs are so bad and so long . The cast of the movie is too big for its own good . Despite such a long movie , none of the characters were well developed . The actresses had the most miniscule roles . They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same . Two of them were weeping synchronized . It was so comical . They moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together.<br /><br />The list just goes on and on . I know I 'm still forgetting something . Anyways , I think I have bashed the film enough that you get the picture .
0 I thought I read somewhere that this was the last Monogram production , but whether that 's true or not it does n't matter , because if it was n't , then it should have been . It 's a deadly dull affair starring John Carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice ( Robert Shayne ) in bringing the dead back to life . Every time their subjects are revived , they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table ( big deal ) . Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it 's dead , and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion ( wooooooooohhhh ) . That 's about all she wrote.<br /><br />For an ultra - cheap Monogram quickie , this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy - schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted . The funniest running joke in the movie is that the " older " doctor Carradine constantly refers to his " young " assistant Shayne as " m'boy " when , in fact , Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they made this !
0 A scientist ( John Carradine -- sadly ) finds out how to bring the dead back to life . However they come back with faces of marble . Eventually this all leads to disaster.<br /><br />Boring , totally predictable 1940s outing . This scared me silly when I was a kid but just bores me now . I had to struggle to stay awake ! With one exception , the acting is horrible . Such expressionless boring actors ! Hopeless.<br /><br />There are some good things about this : Carradine , despite the script , actually gives a very good performance . And there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through walls . There 's also one of the worst - looking knockouts in cinema history . Still , none of this is fun enough to sit through this . Avoid .
0 My girlfriend has the habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies no - one has ever heard anything about . Admittedly , at times , it has led to some fun discoveries . Often times , the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half.<br /><br />She brought home " Advice From A Caterpillar . " She was excited because the box said it was funny . Lucky for us , the propaganda on the boxes never lie.<br /><br />This movie was an exercise in patience . This is one of those movies where , unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself , you will hate every character in the movie . Until the introduction of the one nice character . Which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that , in the real world , would drive anyone away.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE ON < br /><br />So a bunch of emotionally vapid , stuck - up , pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers . Then , they meet a nice , intelligent , emotionally mature and loving character ( an almost perfect guy ) . We then watch the woman , the annoyingly pretentious artist ( in her 30 's ? ) freak out as she falls in love . So she tries to flee from the nice , intelligent , emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she 's been having great but empty sex . She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away . In the real world , she would have been quite successful . I certainly wanted to flee from her and I was n't even in a relationship with her!<br /><br />Although its nice that the man ' fought for his love ' , I never wanted her to have him . ( Nor did my girlfriend ) She did n't deserve him . And , why I wonder , did the director think that the ' almost perfect guy ' should be punished by having to win a relationship with her ? When the artist was asking the ' almost perfect guy ' to leave , we were screaming for him to leave too . There 's a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying , childish and stupid that you want her to fail.<br /><br />Beyond that , let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance . Regarding the other characters , they were well acted , morally bankrupt and annoying characters.<br /><br />It is a comedy and I can say I did laugh a few times in the film . Unfortunately , not much laughing happened until the last 10 minutes or so . But by the time I had those laughs , I had been praying for the movie to end for far too long . I needed to get these vapid characters out of my life.<br /><br />If you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they do n't deserve , then this is the movie for you .
0 This film concerns purportedly non - establishment types ( aesthetically and sexually ) who apparently can not resist basic romantic needs . Although some excellent players take part , including Jon Tenney , Timothy Olyphant , and Cynthia Nixon , they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue ; which is n't . Nixon 's role possesses the best lines , but she often homes in on them too quickly , a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director . The grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche , spent or not , and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy .
0 Why ? Why did they make this movie ? If Timothy Olyphant was n't shirtless in it several times , there would be ABSOLUTELY no reason to watch this movie , ever . Um ... Plot ? Nope . Well - defined characters ? nope . The only time I laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she - bang . P.S. Andy Dick ? Nope .
0 Not a movie , but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the British Invasion , that followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles to the music world . Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond , but a lot of them did . Featured are : Herman 's Hermits , Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas , Peter and Gordon , Honeycombs , Nashville Teens , Animals , and of course , the Beatles.<br /><br />It is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts .
0 Ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in British popular music , it 's wrong on so many fronts that it 's laughable . Tommy Quickly ? The Honeycombs ? The movie DOES include a song by the Spencer Davis group , two by the Animals , and one tacked on live film of the Beatles doing their live version of Twist and Shout ( all 1:20 ) . But all in all , an awkward display of British music circa 1964 . Oh , and Herman 's Hermits .
0 Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945 . He only directed 2 and " Black Gold " was one , ( the other was also from 1936 ) . Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence but in this he was playing a good kid . He was obviously quite popular on the " quickie " circuit - he made so many films . In this one he plays the son of an old oil rigger who is convinced that he will strike oil very soon.<br /><br />J.C. Anderson ( Berton Churchill ) is trying to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there is going to be oil struck at any moment . A geologist , Henry , comes on the scene and helps " Fishtail 's " dad . He also convinces " Fishtail " to go to school regularly . Henry has his eye on Cynthia , the pretty teacher . This was Gloria Shea 's last film - she had begun her career as Olive Shea in " Glorifying the American Girl " ( 1929 ) . " Fishtail 's " dad is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice . When Henry is kidnapped Anderson tries to persuade " Fishtail " to sell his oil lease . It all ends well with oil being struck and " Fishtail " going to Military school.<br /><br />It is okay for a rainy day .
0 This movie was terrible to say the least . I was hoping for a lot better after seeing " High School Musical " . The whole entire movie was a complete rip off of " The Simple Life " , only it was n't a reality show.<br /><br />The acting was not good at all . Amanda Michalka had her moments , when she was n't that terrible . On the other hand Alyson Michalka was bad all the way through . Chris Gallinger , who played the love interest of Amanda was playing a french guy , but had an awful accent . One good thing about this movie was the completely adorable Michael Trevino , who played Alyson 's love interest . Just something to keep in mind , if this movie had been aired before " High School Musical " it probably would not have seemed as bad . But it was no comparison.<br /><br />Overall I give it a 2 .
0 This movie is truly awful . After seeing the advertisement for it , i thought it could have its charms ... but it didn't . The girls can not act , and they can not sing either . The soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs , and its not a pretty sight , Terrible story line , unbelievable plot , its one of Disney 's worst movies by FAR!. Ally is not a bad actress on " Phil of the Future " , so i do n't know what happened in " Cow Belles " . And her sister , AJ , seems to be just hitching a ride on her sisters " fame " , and she displays no talent what so ever.<br /><br />At the end of the movie the girls do finally learn some cliché morals , but this is to late to rescue this train wreck movie.<br /><br />Awful
0 This movie kind of reminds me of A Mary - Kate and Ashley movie - only worse . Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress , in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk . i think that after high - school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely was n't it . The story line was n't that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney . I 'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie did n't make me like her any better . i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do ( which sadly I did n't )
0 I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it 's late then I 'm pretty forgiving of movies . Although I tried , I just could not stand this movie at all , it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on . Although I know it 's suppose to be a comedy but I did n't find it very funny . It was also an especially unrealistic , and jaded portrayal of rural life . In case this is what any of you think country life is like , it 's definitely not . I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute , but the french guy was really fake . I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story , but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it , it 's just too annoying .
0 How Disney can you get ? Preppy rich girls act like idiots , buy a bunch of stuff , and get taught a lesson . Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself ? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human ? Whatever the psycho - analysis , this movie sucked.<br /><br />The girls want a rich party for their rich lives . But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant ( yes , milk ) going to employ the workers . They keep it afloat until daddy comes home . And the man at the beginning , who appears to be the one that takes the money , is the one . But the ending is dumb . Webcam in the Cayman Islands ? Huh ? Not worth my time ever again . < br /><br />But it is better than Howl 's Moving Castle . " D- "
0 Aldolpho ( Steve Buscemi ) , an aspiring film maker , lives in a battered NYC apartment and relies on his mother to help make the rent . He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica ( Jennifer Beals)who may or may not be married but who Aldolpho would love to star in his movie . When Al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe , he thinks he 's got it made . That is , until Joe takes Al along on an adventure to steal a Porsche for part of the financial backing . Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone ? And , will Angelica star in the film ? This is , in this viewer 's opinion , an awful movie . The script is abysmal , with a plot that wanders willy nilly . Beals practically snarls all of her lines and Buscemi , though likable , is nondescript . There is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot . Finally , the production values are very poor , too , making the film look second rate at all times . If you have time on your hands , it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie . But , if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment , go ahead and watch the darn thing . Beals does look beautiful , after all .
0 A terrible movie as everyone has said . What made me laugh was the cameo appearance by Scott McNealy , giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos . McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem , a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft . They have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft . So , were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire?<br /><br />There 's no public record I see of SUN 's involvement , but clearly the makers of this movie know Scott McNealy . An interesting mystery .
0 It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words , yet very naive on the corporate world . The Justice Department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win . The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting , yet every bit as sinister . I seriously doubt ANY corp would actually kill someone directly ; even the mod is more indirect these days . In the real world , they do kill people with nicotine , pollution , additives , poisons , etc . This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks , I think , and the studios did n't know the difference . They just wanted something to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news .
0 AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook , but the director cut out her best scenes . In the scenes that she are in , she is just a zombie . She is involved in a sub - plot that is simular to a sub - plot in " Get Carter " , but she handles the sub - plot better in " Get Carter".(I blame the director ) The director 's homage to Hitchcock was corny . ( It 's the scene were Ryan Philippe 's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin 's charactor , at least I think it 's a homage to Hitchcock . The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out . I think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences .
0 Obvious attack on Microsoft made by people who do n't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally.<br /><br />Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates , and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left.<br /><br />While microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times , it 's unlikely they actually murder people . Therefore , the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning.<br /><br />The " deeper " point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public , and not subject to intellectual property laws . However , this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives ( and rewards ) provided by intellectual property.<br /><br />It 's one thing to be opposed to anti - competitive conduct -- that 's common sense . It 's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place , which is what the film 's mantra ( " knowledge belongs to mankind " ) represents.<br /><br />Yet another example of Hollywood being completely out of touch with reality .
0 One more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers.<br /><br />Looks authors of that movie do n't know real specific of programmers world.<br /><br />20 top programmers in the world , program which have own satellites ( for what ? ) , program which using satellite freq . , somebody kill somebody to steal the codes ( why ? ) and much more of stupid moments at this movie.<br /><br />Peoples who not programmers not will see something awful at that movie , because not professionals on this . But peoples will see not real things.<br /><br />Programmers will find that movie odd and awful - because lots of moments inside movie is not RELATED real life ( why movie not scifi in this case ? ) .
0 I sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie . I 'm still not sure if I regret it or not . I felt like I was watching the film made by that group of film school students that did n't quite make the cut . It plays up every Hollywood cliché imaginable , all the while flogging us with the ' corporations are the ultimate evil ' message . Subtlety this movie does not know . As far as that goes , it even manages to provide it 's own spoilers.<br /><br />The story appears to be a computer nerd 's fantasy world come true . The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend , yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker ( I think ) , among many other nerd - fantasy - come - true elements that you 'll have to see for yourself.<br /><br />As well , I should 've known it would be a z - movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip - off.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one , I 'm afraid .
0 Antitrust falls right into that category of films that aspire to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat . I do n't hate the film , but it is missing key elements , such as suspense . There have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers , such as Hackers and The Net . They all fall short . The improbable ending of both The Net and Antirust seem to be nearly identical . These movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception : People in the PC business having this over - indulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives it 's life waiting to hear the latest news about PC 's and software . I have worked for many companies and industries , and they all seem to suffer from an expanded view of their own self - importance , as does this film.<br /><br />The way they introduced plot lines was pathetic . Showing Milo , who is deathly allergic to Sesame Seeds , almost ingest one from a restaurant breadbasket crossed the line of stupidity . Only his ' girlfriend ' prevented him from sure death . This makes one wonder how Milo could have survived as long as he did , braving the perils of Big Mac buns and Sesame Seed breadsticks , as they cloak themselves as , well .... Sesame Seed breadsticks and Big Mac buns.<br /><br />Antitrust also does n't provide much suspense . The patterned and predictable plot twists are easily figured out long before they are revealed ( come on , was anyone REALLY stunned when Yee Jee Tso was killed ? ) , thereby destroying any real shock value . And here again we have yet another film / story where at the end , the bad guys are chasing the good guys to ' get the disk ' . We need to have a moratorium on this Simple Simon plot line for about 20 years . Still , I pressed on . Maybe the ending would be the payoff , but no . The completely ridiculous ending where we have the head of company security , another supposed evil guy , turn around and be the good guy that enables Milo to bring down N.U.R.V CEO Gary Winston was laughable . And of course , the news coverage of the arrest of Gary Winston is more fevered than when Hinckley or Oswald was brought into custody . Gary Winston , played by Tim Robbins , is a cardboard cutout of the same character Robbins played in Arlington Road . But that fits perfectly here in Antitrust , which should be called ' Anticlimactic ' or ' Anti - Original'.<br /><br />In the years to come , this film will likely be banished , to be shown only on your local third rate UHF channel .
0 After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema , i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller , setting it in the competitive world of computer companies . The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good . But when i did n't go to watch it in it 's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss . Patiently i waited for it 's DVD release , then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening 's viewing . The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film . For a start the direction is appalling . There 's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself , so he can appear in the film . I would n't be rushing out to employ him in the future . Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe . Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he 's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he 's running and having geeky friends , but he just does n't look right . The female stars , Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani do n't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests . The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it 's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along . The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you do n't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD . Causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story .
0 Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before . It is BOILER ROOM . It is THE FIRM . And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE . And there are NO new elements here . Except for the all - to - clear Bill Gates - allegory . Conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie - making , but why does it have to be so extreme ? Boiler room is a good movie , because it - for a while at least - seems realistic . In Antitrust everything is wrong . How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? I 'd give it 1 , but the soundtrack is OK , so 2/10 .
0 My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile . The movie is not supposed to be funny at all , but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever . First , Phillippe ( I forget what his character is called and I do n't really care ) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top - security terminals . Not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so - scary Lego - room , which hosts the super computers . This is plain funny . The tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room . The ending , like all else , is very very very cheesy , especially when the bad guy 's lawyer shows up ' right on time ' . Anyway , this movie is a good laugh . If you need something to make fun of , definitely see it .
0 The best thing about this movie was , uh , well , I ca n't think of anything . This was bad . The script was especially bad . The technical concepts were bad . The " suspenseful " plot was bad . The dialog was bad . Avoid at all costs . Do not rent . Do not watch . You 'll be sorry .

Realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling - check .
0 Dennis Hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated American actors of our time , and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer . Most movies Hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree , but in this movie , Hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield . Once I got into the plot of the movie , I was hooked , but it 's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film.<br /><br />The concept of the film is great - not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer , but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer . The subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous , but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt.<br /><br />That 's about all that is good you can say about the film . Although Hopper did try to act like a tough , experienced street smart cop , I ca n't help but feel his acting was below par , and there was n't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case . The directing was also terrible - it did n't have the feel of a true film , but rather a TV - movie production . This is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down . When the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion , the acting was weak , predictable and terribly unexciting . That 's when I knew that 1st of all , the action is going to be atrocious.<br /><br />The angling of the camera was amateurish , and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer 's little sister had no true distinctive effect . If it was supposed to be scary , it was n't . Everyone 's acting was terrible , and even for Hopper , I did n't feel for his character , and I just did n't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter.<br /><br />The final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team . Once I saw the swat team in action , I was thinking , finally , something good . But I was wrong . 1st of all , the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys . That is just impossible . 2nd of all , apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their HKA4 submachine guns with one hand . Had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun , these 4 idiots would 've been blown to bits because they were n't even aiming at anything or paying close attention . They should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward , but it just looks like they 're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around . 3rd , SWAT team members do not yell out commands such as " Keep your eyes open , watch out for yourselves , are we good to go ... etc . " In reality , they use hand signals or have radios . But they 're literally yelling at each other - how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you 're coming ? ? ? And to top it all off , these guys have no plan - apparently they 're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase . Eventually they end up doing nothing . That was the last straw . I 'm no expert on special forces , but basically what I 've just outlined , is pretty common sense . When the audience knows the movie is terrible , the action pretty much becomes the life - saver of the movie - when you ca n't even make an effort to make the action great , the movie is lost.<br /><br />I give 2 stars for the concept , but the rest can not be credited . If you want to watch a crime thriller , do n't bother with this one . There 's plenty of crime in the movie - but it has the lack of thrill .
0 The movie had a good concept , but the execution just did n't live up to it.<br /><br />What is this concept ? Well , story - wise , it 's " Dirty Harry " meets " M " . A child killer has begun terrorizing a city . The lead detectives ( Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest ) have never dealt with a serial killer before . The Mayor and the Police Chief , in desperation , secretly hire the local mob to speed things up ... to go places and do things that the police would n't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible.<br /><br />To be fair , this film DOES genuinely have some good things to offer.<br /><br />Besides the concept , I liked the look of the killer 's hideout . Norman Bates has his basement . This guy has an eerie sewer . In some of the shots , the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls ; often giving these scenes a creepy , dreamlike quality.<br /><br />The acting was good too . Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age.<br /><br />Once you get past that , however , it more - or - less goes downhill.<br /><br />The film is paced way too fast . The actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating . This could have been fixed in two ways : either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots . Either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery.<br /><br />For an example of how bad this is , one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this : at one point in his life , the suspect went to a pet shop ... That 's right ... I'm being totally serious here . It 's like they went from point A ( the first clue ) to point Z ( the suspect ) and skipped over all the " in - between " steps.<br /><br />Then there 's the characters . The only ones I actually liked were two pick - pockets you meet about half - way through the movie . Considering that they 're minor characters , I 'd call that a bad sign.<br /><br />Finally , there 's the mob angle . This is the one that gets me the most because THIS is why I coughed up the $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place . I mean , what a hook ! There 's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10 - 15 years . The mob angle was a gimmick that COULD have helped it rise above the rest ... , but it didn't.<br /><br />I figured the gangsters 's methods would be brutal , but fun and thrilling at the same time ; kind of like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they 'd even throw in some heist movie elements too . We ARE talking about criminals , after all . Instead , we 're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid . The detectives question witnesses . What does the mob do ? They interrogate and kill them . It 's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either . I actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they 're hunting.<br /><br />Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest , I 'd say give this one a miss . Maybe some day , they 'll reuse the same story idea and do it RIGHT . I hope so . I hate to see such a good concept go to waste .
0 This movie kinda let me down . It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches . They both said no way its summer ! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one . But he really does n't do anything too interesting or exciting . I 'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gon na solve this case . They just say lets do police work and we 'll solve it . And what s up with all the old men with pool cues . I did n't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses . And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer . With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Di@k is the size of a schoolbus . Come on what cruddy lines . I thought he was gon na hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies . I got this movie used and would n't buy it new . I suggest you skip this movie . Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee .
0 Maybe I 've seen one too many crime flick , or maybe I do n't take the right drugs.<br /><br />This was the most cliché ridden , plot deficient , plot - absurd , just plain stupid movie I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />As for the direction , it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together.<br /><br />In fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed.<br /><br />It 's a bad rip off of " M " the classic Fritz Lang film starring Peter Lorre . You 'd be SO much better off renting that instead .
0 * * * Possible Plot Spoilers***<br /><br />I adore Dennis Hopper . I question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000 's The Spreading Ground . This movie flat out sucks and I 'm about to tell you why.<br /><br />This is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena . One hitch : there 's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business . The Mayor makes a deal with the Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court . Det . Ed Delongpre has other plans . He wants this guy caught too , but he 's on the level and believes in the system . He wants to see the system do it 's job.<br /><br />That could have been pretty good . It could have been riveting . It was horrible . First , they label this guy a Serial Killer . Err no . There are specific criteria and none of it fits here . The bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day , and I think it was 2 the second day . This entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period .... Hardly Serial Killer action . I do n't care what warped motives they give him in the end , Serial Killers do their deed over a long time span . They do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days . That 's a Spree.<br /><br />Ok that irritant aside , the acting was atrocious . The only name here was Hopper , and he 's the only one who came even close to pulling off his part . Unfortunately , he 's kinda type - cast to me and I think he does psycho parts much , much better . This just was n't a good vehicle for Hopper . It did n't allow him to do what he does best , which is to act all creepy . It 's not that he did bad , it 's that I 've seen him do so much better.<br /><br />The Irish Mob guy , Johnny Gault ( Tom McCamus - Long Day 's Journey Into Night ) , who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff . Contradiction ? Not really . He is trying to play the cold , hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden . Boring to the max . He did n't scare me . He did n't inspire any emotion at all except boredom . I can not tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie.<br /><br />The other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made - for - TV movie . You know what I mean . The poor production values , low budget , re - use of scenes to save costs . Just eh . Yanno ? But , I feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those.<br /><br />Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project . He bit off more than he could chew . I ca n't help feeling that Hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend . That 's the only rational I can come up with . This was Vanlint 's first job as Director , third as cinematographer . Hopefully this was a learning experience for him.<br /><br />I wo n't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one , but I do want to say that they all dropped the ball here ... even Hopper . In a scene that should have been emotionally gut - wrenching for the detective , it was just .. well .. blah . I did n't see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear - change this guy made . Very disappointing.<br /><br />This 100 grueling minutes long and Rated R for violence and language . No kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this , so no worries there . It 's not suitable for anyone anyway . heh.<br /><br />Skip this one . You 'll thank me later .
0 The plot is about the death of little children . Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings . During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter . In the end the serial killer get caught . That 's it . But before you find out who dunnit , you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors . It is unbelievable how bad these actors are , including Hopper . I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time . Just do n't watch the movie . I 've warned you .
0 the lowest score possible is one star ? that 's a shame . really , i 'm going to lobby IMDb for a " zero stars " option . to give this film even a single star is giving WAY too much . am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper 's head at the station ? and the acting , or should i say the lack thereof ? apparently talent was n't a factor when the casting director came to town . my little sister 's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion . and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board . the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been ... oh , wait , no , no , it 's already as bad as it can get .
0 The thing that stands out in my mind in this film ( sadly ) is the introduction , where John Berlin ( Andy Garcia ) is driving into town . You see his Mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with Redwood trees . It 's quite beautiful . < br /><br />As to Andy Garcia playing a character with the last name of Berlin , well ... Andy is just too hispanic / Latin for it to be passable . Maybe a caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story ? Who knows . But I can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks , he stands out like a sore thumb , especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry . Yeah , I know , big deal right ? He 's still a good actor.<br /><br />The title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims Jennifer . All of the victims are blind and he dismembers them . The killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness ( do n't ask ) appears , Helena Robertson ( Uma Thurman ) . Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person , to my surprise . When I saw Lance Henriksen playing Sgt . Freddy Ross I got worried . Henriksen 's played in some pretty strange films , especially of late . I still ca n't forget him in the bloodbath movie , Pumpkinhead . < br /><br />Berlin movies into a small town from L.A. as a detective . He begins investigating the Jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill . His brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far - fetched . So did the irony of * SPOILER * Freddy 's murder , with the recording and name similarities . I got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight " Jennifers " . And the motive of the killer as simply deranged did n't pack much of a punch . In retrospect , this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons.<br /><br />John Malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of Garcia ! Albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out . As to the ending , it is a bit of a surprise , but is highly arguable , much like Sgt . Ross ' murder . The killer chooses to walk after his running victim , opting instead to frolick I guess.<br /><br />And there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it 's ridiculous . I wo n't ruin the very end because despite it 's shakiness , it 's a good surprise . Afterward though , you 'll probably say , as I did , " boy was she lucky ! " 4/10
0 This is a thriller with a good concept , good acting , good photography and good intentions all around , but which is confused and disjointed in execution.<br /><br />Garcia stars as John Berlin , an L.A. forensic detective who has moved to a small California town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there . He soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in . The known victim is theorized to be blind , which leads to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind.<br /><br />Despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where I found myself wondering , ' how the hell did we wind up here ? ' or ' how did we find this out ? ' I found it confusing and disjointed , despite the good acting , etc . John Malkovich has a small part toward the end as an F.B.I. investigator out to get Berlin.<br /><br />Not recommended .
0 This one is bad . A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it . A series of crimes , the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie , the classic investigations . And also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what 's going on and is n't believed by anyone , so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth . Not too much in this one . Vote : 4 out of 10 .
0 Let me start out by saying I can enjoy just about any bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970 's . Seriously . This one was downright awful.<br /><br />There are way too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them work ( except for the croc - gone - wild thing ) very well at all . There are some ignorant Westerners , of course , who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere . I do n't even remember where it takes place ... how sad is that ... Basically , people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ' ceremonies but eventually they upset the ' Alligator God ' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage , killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well . Sounds good , yeah ? Well , do n't get your hopes up . There is minimal violence until the end , the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable.<br /><br />There is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator , like a dart , into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking . I 'm not kidding . In another wonderfully crafted special effect , a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator , who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van . ( A few minutes ago , he was only big enough to eat a human , but now he dwarfs a full - size cargo van ... ) It is really pathetic . The only other flick I can think of where the effects were so bad I was pulled out of the story was Bruno Mattei 's masterpiece , " Rats , " what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who COULDN'T be terrified.<br /><br />Normally I 'd say anything Sergio Martino was a solid must - see but this one is a must - pass . Waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + sticker price from No Shame . This one is a SHAME.<br /><br />2 out of 10 , kids .
0 First off I want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars I rated it . I gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all . However , " The Big Alligator River " ( the title my DVD calls it ) is better than your average nature strikes back movie.<br /><br />A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around . Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god Kroona , a giant Alligator . But the creature is n't the only thing the tourists and the main characters ( a photographer and the resort staff ) have to worry about , the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too.<br /><br />This movie is a pretty well - done adventure / horror story with a good musical score and direction . But the alligator itself , the main attraction of the movie , is obviously fake looking . Some of the close - ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see . Some of the underwater far - away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky - toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop . But the natives are believable , if not authentic.<br /><br />Probably not the movie that will give you non - stop thrills , if any , but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention . And like a lot of creature movies , this one ends with an extremely high body count . It also has lots of good jungle scenery . Acting is below par though , but who was expecting it to be better , eh ? < br /><br />Much , much better than its recent American counterpart " Primeival " but nothing to be compared with " Jaws " . But remember it may not be engaging at a few points .
0 I really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie . It 's not bad enough to be hilarious . There 's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity ( although there was plenty of opportunity ) . There 's no gore . There 's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there 's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music . That last part was actually funny on many occasions : You see these natives hitting congas and ' jembés ' and that 's indeed what you hear ( badly synchronized ) on the soundtrack . But they also added this funky bass - line on the soundtrack . So , where was the bass - player ? At one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists . Why all of the sudden ? It 's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex , which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river - alligator - god ( I actually missed the explanation for that one ) . But the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex , so why the sudden angriness ? And how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water ? ? ? It 's all silly and pointless . This movie also features the skinniest Afro - American model I 've ever seen.<br /><br />At one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird , crazy old man lives . The only point to that scene is that they make the " shocking " discovery that the killer - crocodile is actually an alligator . Crocodile or alligator , what 's the difference ? It 's big , it 's made out of plastic and it eats people . All the same to me . The alligator is a rather silly creation . It 's very stiff & motionless and does n't even flap its feet when it swims . The eyes do n't even move when they 're shot in close - up . I guess they did n't know ' animatronics ' back then in Italy during 1979 . There 's also a lot of pointless inter - cut shots of the local wildlife . I suspect it 's stock footage.<br /><br />Like , I said , the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason I did n't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and I did n't want to wake the sweet thing . But the last half hour of the movie did get better . We finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them . The most entertaining ( and at the same time funny ) scene is when Alice and Daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses . We 're looking at a matchbox - version of the van falling in the river here . Funny . But nicely shot . In fact there are several other nice traveling camera - moves . Surprisingly for this type of flick . I was gon na point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie , but I do n't wanna spoil it completely , in case you do decide to watch this movie . My advice is to stay away from it . If you wanna see a decent alligator movie , then see Lewis Teague 's ALLIGATOR . I admit , that one is n't Italian and is n't a JAWS rip - off , but it certainly is more fun . And if you 're interested in other movies made by director Sergio Martino , then I strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019 : AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK . That one 's an over - the - top rip - off of every possible existing post - apocalyptic - future - of - doom - movie . " Italians " and " rip - offs " , two words that go together very well .
0 OK - the Cons first : The obligatory ' 70 's alligator ( all right , correction - caiman ) with nonmoving limbs is made the worse for scale miniature underwater shots ( with the full length of reptile comparative to the size of the boat ) utilizing a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in broadly lit water - even for nighttime shots!<br /><br />Unlike most primitives - killing - exploitative - Westerners films , the superstitious natives going bat * * * * and start massacring the vacationers seems unjustified this time . No one really abused the natives - exploited , yes , but far from abusive treatment . After all it was one of the natives ( canoodling with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon ) that brought the curse of the River Demon on them , right?<br /><br />The vacationers are easily annoying ( with the notable exception of the token old - soul / mildly blasphemous - little - girl - who - takes - a - shine - to - the - heroes that you often see in 70 's Euroflicks ) , but far from from deserving violent death - unless they were your next door neighbors , mind you . A couple actually get killed being heroic - notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick . There are only two straight villains in the entire film , so the demises feel more arbitrary than cathartic.<br /><br />The sequence where the giant caiman crunches down and scarfs thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious.<br /><br />The point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving Westerners and practically saying " hey , you are n't so bad after all , sorry about that fuss last night " - because they blew up the monster lizard - has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in . You know , the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for * * * * ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll ... <br /><br />The Pros : Barbara Bach . Barbara Bach . Barbara Bach . Barbara Bach . You ALL know WHY you 're interested in this film in the first place , right ? I thought so . If you 're a Bach completist , get the DVD reissued by NoShame films earlier this year ( digitally remastered with no real extras to speak of , aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution).<br /><br />The hero is n't half bad , being far from an idiot ( always a plus in B films ) and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief.<br /><br />Worth a look , but get it cheaply !
0 Very bad film . Very , very , very bad film . It 's a rarity , but it defenitly is not worth hunting down . This Italian Jaws rip - off makes little sense most of the time , and no sense the rest . The " alligator " is not at all convincing , and many of the sub - plots go nowhere . If it 's at the local video store , you may want to watch it if you 're a fan of monster movies , but it 's not worth hunting down .
0 Not to be confused with Lewis Teague 's " Alligator " ( 1980 ) which actually IS an excellent film , this " Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano " laboriously ends the exotic trilogy Sergio Martino made around the end of the seventies ( including the rather watchable " L'Isola degli uomini pesce " and the not so good " La Montagna del dio cannibale " ) . Tracing outrageously the plot of " Jaws " , the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever . The creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable . Stelvio Cipriani 's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptile 's meal . No thrill out of this , rather laughters actually ! And we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism . Very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude . We could excuse badly made films and poor FXs , but not that kind of mentality . Never !
0 I 'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic . The little girl was a brat , their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked . Besides it was n't even a gator as the film would like us to believe . If you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a Crocodile , not a gator . Obviously they did n't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc . It is a sad excuse for a movie . Especially the ending . I nearly fell asleep with this one .
0 Put aside a Dr. House repeat that I had missed , and a Desperate Housewives ( new ) to watch this one . I do n't know exactly what plagued this movie . I never thought I 'd say this , but I want my 15 minutes of fame back.<br /><br />Script , Direction , I ca n't say . I recognized the stable of actors ( the usual suspects ) , but thought Herbert Marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick . Boy , was I wrong . Dullsville.<br /><br />My favorite parts : where the " office girl " makes with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards into a 087 sorter . LOL @ " the computer " . I 'd like someone identify the next device - a 477 ? It 's before even this dinosaur 's time.<br /><br />And we dinosaurs do n't have that much time to waste .
0 Well here I go with another B industry movie . It 's sad enough to see some badly made films but I do n't care if a B industry or C industry produces the film . Show some effort in your work . The characters are really bad . The acting is n't in question in this one ( surprise ) , but plot is . How can a tight - knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered , and then go on as if nothing happened . What sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor 's ass was . Give me a break .
0 The third installment of the " Carnosaur " trilogy features a bunch of Keystone Kops - quality military commandos trying to kill two Velociraptors and a T - Rex . I give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs . The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy , it really ca n't be taken seriously . More significantly , however , watching this movie I ca n't help but notice some interesting parallels between the " Carnosaur " and " Xtro " trilogies . The first installment in both franchises is a dark , disturbing film that has become a cult classic , the second is an " Alien " ripoff , and the third is a tongue - in - cheek , almost slapstick ( whether intentional or not ) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing . Also , like the " Xtro " franchise , all the " Carnosaur " movies are completely unrelated to one another . They they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the " sequels , " I guess . Obviously " Carnosaur " and " Xtro " have two different production groups at work here , but if you 've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two .
0 This is one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever had the privilege to see.<br /><br />I watched this on DVD with a bunch of friends one Friday night and we just could n't stop laughing from start to finish.<br /><br />The story is simple enough : terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium , but it 's actually carrying a bunch of man - eating dinosaurs . Easy mistake to make . Cue a startlingly incompetent team of Army Special Forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts . They are led by Colonel Rance , played by Scott Valentine ; a man who seems to have perfected ' Smell the fart ' acting , as advocated by Joey in Friends.<br /><br />There 's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting , but unfortunately Rance 's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant , lumbering monsters . Also , the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a Velociraptor attacks ( preumably so we ca n't see how bad the creature effects are).<br /><br />Having said all that , we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next.<br /><br />As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur 's crotch , but as ludicrous , tongue - in - cheek entertainment it 's a roaring success .
0 I do n't know where to start ; the acting , the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine . I ca n't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said , " Our job is done , time for it 's release " . I 'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the UK . I would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are.<br /><br />I do n't know how any of the other IMDb users could find it scary when the " terrifying " dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around .
0 Primal Species comes from B Movie legend Roger Corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a Low Budget B Movie and it knows it.<br /><br />A bunch of terrorists high - jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so , they believe it to hold uranium , but No ..... It contains two Dino 's with a taste for Human Flesh ... Then a Crack team , who might as well be called Delta Force get called in.<br /><br />OK , This ai n't Jurassic Park , and Yes The Dino 's are never clearly seen because it 's obviously a guy in a Costume that 's not too dissimilar to Barney the Dinosaur - only slightly LESS terrifying , but come on guys this had about 1 % of Jurassic Park 's Budget and as such does what it can.<br /><br />Does this deserve to be in the bottom 100? .... HELL NO ! ! ! I think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being WAY WAY overly harsh , it 's much closer to a 4 ... it 's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the Bottom 100 , and has a similar production value to a Sci - Fi Channel Production . ( again Movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on IMDb)<br /><br />The acting is as expected in a B Movie although none of the actors take it that seriously , neither does the script < br /><br />All in All it 's an enjoyable B Movie - Not for Film Snobs < br /><br / > * * out of * * * * *
0 I just could n't stop laughing ! ! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid ! But , never mind that , it is very entertaining ! In this film , you do n't need to pay attention to anything ! The acting is the same - LAME ! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER ( Oh , my I could see the stick that holds T - Rex head for a moment . ) The raptors are the same from the Carnosaur 2 , T - Rex is also the same , but ... in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten . Action is fast , sometimes too fast , actually I talk about fast editing , they edited it so fast , so that we can not see the rubber dinosaurs , but OOPPS ! to late , they are rubber ! Well , only things interesting here is to see Rick Dean in this sequel.<br /><br />What can I say ... do n't rent it ... watch it on TV , with friends , it is much more entertaining !
0 Everything in this film is bad , the story , the acting , the effects but its funny , funny , funny ! ! ! Scott Valentine with the army uniform that s ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious ! The ' ' terrorists '' are as scary and realistic as the ' ' raptors '' , this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh .The part where the giant T - REX who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending .If your into bad films , this is the pot of gold , the mona lisa of b - b - bad ! ! !
0 OK I had higher hopes for this Carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out . I did like Carnosaur 2 better than 1 . I figured well this one is newer so it must be better right ? Well ... I quickly learned I was wrong . I was extremely confused with the casting . They brought back Rick Dean for another spotlight character and Michael MacDonald as a police officer . Now for Rick dean lol , in Carnosaur 2 I thought he fit the role pretty well and was n't really annoyed by him , now in Carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier . Now we are getting goofy here . The movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks , but as soon as Scott Valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs.<br /><br />I'll start with the raptors first , they had there tails drag the ground , which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50 - 60 mph . Now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads did n't move at all . there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place.<br /><br />The t - rex was extremely pathetic , they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies . At least that one looked somewhat frightening . The one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time . The legs when it walked was hilarious , like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff . LOL another thing I noticed is that the hands did not move , they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded ( god the sound effects were awful ) retarded ! ! ! Now if I was the director and realized that I had this to work with maybe I would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact . As for the rest of the movie , well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team I have ever seen . The weapons they used would n't make sense for the scenario . They even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming , now I was tickled at this scene because I thought that while this stupidity was going on that the Dinos would get in there and cause some damage . Instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time . I would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies . You have retarded military , retarded dinosaurs , retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this.<br /><br />Now I 'm not saying I would n't watch this , bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment . It may seem like I 'm ranting but really I 'm hyping this movie up to what it is . Its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself , " did the director really make this seriously ? "
0 OK ..... This is the third in the series of carnosaur . Lets star with the dinosaur puppets ! In the start of the film you ca nt See the Dino 's cause when the body count starts you can only See the Dino 's eye vision , pretty smart to hide the bad puppets ! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance , the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body 's after the Dino rampage , after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream , pretty creepy ! ! ! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found ! It pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can See that its just a guy with a hand puppet ! ? WTF ! The story is simple . 1 . Some terrorist 's attacks some truck cause they though It wash some weapons in there . 2 . They where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t - Rex in there ! How did the t - Rex fit in there ? ? ? 3 . Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs ! Sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive= ( 4 . Holy Jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats ! 5 . The Dino 's is now on a boat in the pacific . 6 : Strange i did n't know that the t - Rex had a strange thing on he s neck ? ? ? 7 . THE END . The film is good if you want a good laugh . 5/10
0 I have n't seen the first two - only this one which is called Primal Species in England . I do n't think I 'll be bothering to look them out though.<br /><br />This is an awful film . Terrible acting , bad dialogue , cheap rubber monsters . Everything about it is so nasty . The most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones , especially one called Polchak , who is an incredible jerk . No - one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army . He lasted for ages but I was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off - I was having nightmares he was going to survive . The Colonel was rubbish too - all moody pouts and clueless shouting . And the specky Doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno . I was waiting for her to take her glasses off , shake her hair and turn into a vamp , but she did n't . Pity that , as it would 've livened the film up no end.<br /><br />Didn't Roger Corman used to make half decent films once ?
0 Arg . The shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all - awful third film . This time , European terrorists(Irish I 'd say ) hi - jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium . They pull into a shipyard , open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs . Pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists , the cops and some marines . The whole film seems to be ( again ) largely inspired from Alien(as Carnosaur 2 was ) with the pathetic marines going through the " claustrophobic " shipyard ? guns at the ready . This third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot , with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine 's head off . The dinos are stiff , shuffling creatures as usual and the T - Rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars(it also appears to have no eyes ) . One of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene : they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck . On opening it , surprise ! The Rubber Reptile Gang burst out and devour them . Why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first ? How did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside ? What was the point of filming this scene ? ? ? ? Oh bother , who cares ? Both thumbs down for the Over - sized Rubber Iguanas .
0 Like all Carnosaur movies , this is a joke . The way the dinosaurs move , reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls , because they can not be any stiffer or more fake - looking than they were.<br /><br />The plot had no sense whatsoever . I mean , first they 're on a bus , then in a warehouse then , all of a sudden , they 're on a boat . And let 's be serious , does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van , or on a ship ? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals , and now they can fit on a moving van . It sounds stupid even when you think about it.<br /><br />The only reason for which I gave this a 3 , is because it 's still entertaining . I found it better than the first one ( have n't watched the second yet ) . Just , do n't rent it . I saw it on TV and it 's a good thing I did because I would n't have wanted to waste money renting it .
0 This is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen . I rented it as a joke , expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes , and let me just say I 've never laughed so hard in my life . The first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life . This is not a dinosaur movie , but more a movie that makes fun ( and does n't mean to at all ) of the action genre . I did n't see the first two , but judging by the complexity of the plot , I do n't think there 's to much I missed . If you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy , than I insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
0 If this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema , if you 've never seen a " Moving Picture " before , you 'll think this movie is a child of the gods . BUT if you 've seen a movie , a TV show , even Barney the Dinosaur , then you wo n't be very impressed by this film . Heck Barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick.<br /><br />Now I like B movies . I just watched " The Giant Gila Monster " right before I watched this swill , and I liked that movie much better . It works as a B movie . It has lamer dialog , hokier acting , cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real Gila Monster as the monster ! Carno 3 just does n't pack much of a B movie punch . It has some gore , and that Polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming , almost .... flaccid . It 's the Little Engine That Could n't of Dinosaur movies . I 'm not saying you should n't watch the movie . < br /><br />Some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained . If you 're one of those people , then give this movie a shot .
0 This movie is the worst movie i have ever seen ... it is humorous how bad it is .. the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing .. (i've seen porno 's with a better plot ) When the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away . But as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it is n't going to do anything compared to if you watch it .. i do n't recommend renting it but if it comes on TV watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean . I could n't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
0 In general I like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap . No script , no dialogues , no acting . And the brave colonel Rance trying to show he is tough and so curving his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid Proctor from the Police Academy . So this was a complete waste of time ( fortunately not waste of money as I saw the film on TV ) . And I really can not understand 7 people who graded this sh*t 10 . They must 've joked . My advice , if you see this title run from it !
0 Some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death .. I personally think that this movie is a disgust , which should have never been released . This movie is repulsive , illogical and meaningless . Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come . The appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them . Such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering .. " Kill Bill " would be another example but at least " Kill Bill " has its purpose , meaning , climax and resolution ..
0 I was n't really fond of the first " Cube " movie . It was a good idea , but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much . Did n't really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original . I was intrigued , thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original 's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters . Well I thought wrong.<br /><br />"Cube Zero " starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never - ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the Cube . The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men 's daily routine . Several questions are created from it , concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation . All of which are left entirely to the viewer . The acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie 's first half moved relatively well.<br /><br />With the story moving on , one of the two " watchers " begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing . And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped . Here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese.<br /><br />Sent by the people who run the Cube program we are introduced to the character " Jax " . Along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure . To start of " Jax " looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever " popular " glass eye , that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half 's relatively nice pace . What s more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie . With some incredibly corny lines , perhaps the screenwriter got bored and did n't care . The acting itself degrades to a further low when the former " watcher " meets the group in the Cube . The entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it.<br /><br />Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters , dialog and acting " Cube Zero " is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie .
0 Incredible . Does it get any dumber than this ? Not a chance . The stupidity in this movie would shame even Ed Wood , De Palma , and Woo . If the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog , then this one has cretinous dialog . Amazing . But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog , too . In spite of the acting and the dialog , I liked the first two films , but " Cube Zero " will surely kill the franchise . The utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left - winger.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if such leftists even themselves realize just how anti - democracy and pro - dictatorship they are . In this movie they obviously target the US  a democracy . Why do n't they target Korea , Iran , Syria , China , Zimbabwe etc . in anti - military movies ? Sure , most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon , but that 's beside the point . It 's obvious : writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes , whether they are aware of it or not . I would even go as far as to say that ANYONE who adamantly attacks US foreign policies all the time , has anti - democratic beliefs in his core.<br /><br />Back to the movie : apart from being so far - fetched that it is n't even funny any more , the film has many obvious illogicalities . For example , for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails , yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system ! Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy . Or how about that cretinous character , the one - eyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if he 's in a bad Mel Brooks comedy . In fact , as soon as this creature appears the movie loses ALL seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting : it really does become a comedy .
0 Pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films , it 's got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second . By concentrating on the guys who ' run ' the cube , it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube , as we simply do n't care about the characters inside . Much of the film is simply boring , and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass - eyed superior and the green - eyed crazy marine . After that , though , it just descends into over - the - top unintentional hilarity . The ending is fitting though , tying it back into the first one in an indirect way . The script is terrible , the acting mediocre at best , and the direction unimpressive . A much lesser follow - up .
0 As far as the movie goes , it 's an OK science fiction movie . It has a lot of cool stuff in it , and some quality scenes . That said , it 's not that good , and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched ... <br /><br />As for calling this another cube - movie is utter and complete bullsh!t . This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie ... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first , but the introduction of people / androids as part of the " team " behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch ... <br /><br />I gave this a 3 * * * because of the backstabbing of the original . This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all ... <br /><br />Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube , but not recommendable for fans of the series ...
0 I had high hopes for this movie , because I enjoyed the book so much . However , I do n't think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I had n't already read the book . The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule , but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly . The corrupt government officials have comfortable , almost luxurious lives , while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival . Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed . Orwell 's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world . It has been several years since I 've read the book , but one hears references to Big Brother , the Thought Police , and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation . Probably many people using these terms do n't realize where the terms came from . I strongly recommend that you read the book .
0 I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book , and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one . I think it was the latter . First of all , it was inaccurate in many small , yet important details . One of the first things I noticed was , during Winston 's day to day life in his work , his conversations , eating in the cafeteria , etc . he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear . One of the most important parts of the book , was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT . This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions . In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip . While in the movie , he does it so often and without fear , that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.<br /><br />Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall , yes a very small change , but it begs the question , what 's the point ? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book , and that is morphing characters.<br /><br / > The large inaccuracies were far more disturbing , however . First of all , one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent , yet crude philosophy . In the movie , they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology . Which is true , in a sense , when directed with its facism , but if that 's all you get out of Big Brother , you really missed the point of the book . The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that , in a way , it has some points behind its philosophy . When O'Brien is picking at Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love , he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother . The fact that he listens , and advances forward in his philosophy , is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing . In the end , ( careful SPOILER ahead ) when Winston says he loves Big Brother , the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this , or the actual power behind the philosophy . I am in no way saying that the Big Brother 's philosophy has points that appeal to me , but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing.<br /><br / > Also , how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film ? It was awful , no connection whatsoever.<br /><br / > And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address ? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he made contact with him . In the movie , they just jump the gun.<br /><br / > But that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption : because its impossible NOT to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours . How could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours ? At the very least , the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections . Anything less is just pointless.<br /><br />If you loved the book , and I mean TRULY adored it , you will not approve of this movie , and chances are , you already knew you would n't . Because the book is unfilmable , and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.<br /><br />Two stars out of ten
0 After hearing about George Orwell 's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life , I 'm now 37 , but never having read the book , I am totally confused as to what I 've just seen.<br /><br />I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel , as i 'm sure most are , but only through hearsay and quotes . Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery , and even with it I 'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.<br /><br />On the plus side ... <br /><br />The cinematography is amazing , Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate . The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.<br /><br />Now for the down sides , and there are plenty ... <br /><br />There is a war going on , ( at least as far as the propaganda is concerned ) , but why & with who ? Nothing is explained . There are a couple of names bandied about ( Eurasia etc ) , but they mean nothing without explanation.<br /><br />Who is Winston ? what does he do ? where does he come from ? where does he work ? why is he changing news reports ? why is n't he on the front line ? Why does n't he eat the food in the canteen ? What is that drink he 's drinking through the entire film ? Why is he so weak & ill ? Why is n't he brainwashed like the rest of them ? What 's the deal with his mother & sister ? What happened to his father ? A little back story would have been nice , no scrub that , essential for those like myself that have n't read the book . Without it , this is just a confusing and hard to follow art - house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dis - jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out what s going on . I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it 's very annoying all the same.<br /><br />Also , I know this has been mentioned before , but why all the nudity ? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.<br /><br />I personally ca n't abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days . We are not all brainwashed simpletons , but this is a few steps too far the other way . I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you 've read the book because if this film really is the ' literal translation ' that I 've seen many people say , I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.<br /><br />There 's no denying that it was light years ahead of it 's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date , ( maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be ? ) , but many sci - fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.<br /><br />I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i 'm to make any sense out of this.<br /><br />All in all , very disappointed in something I 've waited for years to watch .
0 I am a massive fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE . I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity , Burton is an actor I hold in high regard so when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien I was swung.<br /><br />I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fears started to set in , mostly regarding the frankly terrible " Theme song " , hearing the Eurythmics mechanically shouting " 1984 ! " over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.<br /><br />The acting on a whole is pretty good , Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt , especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene . However this is also where the movie is let down . The movie spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Winston and Julia , which frankly is n't what Orwell was writing about . He was writing about a harrowing future , about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother . The movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book , Winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world , and his re - education via O'Brien.<br /><br />The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect . Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien , they do not commit themselves to Goldstien 's Brotherhood and confess their crimes . There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end , if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.<br /><br />A terrible screenplay , which some excellent acting can not rescue . Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point Orwell was trying to make , and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible .
0 I have heard about this novel a long time ago , many of my friends have recommend me to read it . I searched it in every place and finally found it . This is a book that every man should read , because it is genius and because of it 's vision . I enjoyed every page.<br /><br />I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it . When I finally did I was very disappointed , many things that are in the book are not in the movie ( I do not think that this is a spoiler ) that just makes the movie not logical ... Michael Radford might be a good director , but a bad writer . Especially as a book adopter . The movie is not dark at all , the writing is really bad , the only thing that is good , even great , is the acting . John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I myself could see as Winston Smith.<br /><br />What angers me the most are the people in IMDb that called this " The Best Adaptation Ever " without even reading the book ! Or knowing anything about screen writing!<br /><br />You can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book , do not consider this as an alternative . As a fan of the book , I was very disappointed.<br /><br />The points I gave for this movie goes for the acting .
0 A few weeks ago , I read the classic George Orwell novel , 1984 . I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books I 've read recently . So when I rented the DVD , I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up . Unfortunately , the movie did n't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully did in his book . The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book , because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do . John Hurt , the main actor , is droll the entire way through , and hardly does any acting until the end . We never really find out what he does for a living , or why his love affair is forbidden , or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion . This book can not be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters , and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film . Besides that , John Hurt was a terrible casting choice , looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old Winston he was supposed to be portraying . On a more positive note , however , the rest of the cast was well chosen . It 's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor . -Brian O.
0 ' Ninteen Eighty - Four ' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted . It is a very dark film , and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself . It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self - centred . The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours ( contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams ) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places . However , despite the film 's cleverness at portraying this idea , the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across . It seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story .
0 The book is fantastic , this film is not . There is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book . Hell , total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it , even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world . The bleak German expressionistic colours , the black and white footage from the vision screens , there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984 . The main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage . This film decides to take a mock - communistic approach to set design , atmosphere and theme , yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist , worship - the - humble - worker theme itself . This book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before . I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap . The soundtrack is annoying , the lack of foresight is annoying , this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novel 's messages to the viewer .
0 I think that the shots and lighting were very poor . When I watched it for the first time I thought it was the old version(1956 ) . When I really found out the true year of the film I was shocked . I did n't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently . That s really all I wanted to say . This film had a good plot though , nothing you could n't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that George Orwelll wrote . All I really want to say has already been said except for this : I ca n't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations . I gave this film a One ( awful ) , because I felt that it was very badly made . Well that is all . So long
0 I must admit , there are few books with corresponding movies that I have actually read before seeing the cinematic adaptation . Nineteen Eighty - Four happens to be one of those rare cases . The book was great . It was immersive and interestingly prophetic . But the movie just plain sucked . It is easily the worst film I have ever seen . The only reason I did n't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two - part assignment for a class . It was dark and grotesque , but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere . The acting was nothing above average , and considering the fact that there was n't much to act out , this was severely disappointing . The book , for example , did n't give me the impression that Winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time . Boring , disturbing , and visually unappealing , the movie totally cannibalized the book . Wait a second ... Isn't it British ?
0 I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really hated it . I was in year 10 ( and aged 15 ) so that may have has something to do with it . But for English this year , year 11 , we had to read Animal Farm , also by George Orwell . Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution , my opinion is that it is a terrible book , and I also hated it.<br /><br />But 1984 , I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen , and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet . I 'm sorry to everyone who loved his work , but I unfortunately did not . The themes in the movie were well portrayed , but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards . This is only my opinion , and I 'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film .
0 John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory , and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah , USA.<br /><br />An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting , with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West . It 's based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co - writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill . Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career . A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third , where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse . The light hearted approach to the romantic strand does n't sit quite right , and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work . But hey , stunt men deserve their moment of glory always . Solid support comes from George ' Gabby ' Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma , particularly when rattling off his pistol . But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget , it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts . 4/10
0 I bought a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks at my local Suncoast , which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks ( including its sequel " Witchcraft XI " ) . So basically I paid the rock bottom price of $ 2.50 for this movie , if you do the math . I ca n't exactly say I was ripped off . I have a thing for trashy horror movies , but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name . The budget could n't be over $ 1,000 ( though it appears as if they spent a total of $ 1.50 ) . I know it 's a low - budget film , but that 's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork . The film " Blood Cult , " though not very good , was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting . The acting in this movie is the definition of " effortless , " especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent . Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page . You can take that figuratively or literally . I would n't be surprised if the script was off - camera as they were performing . I said before that I 've never seen a bad English actor . This movie has quite a few bad ones . And though English movies are n't always good , they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication , which is why I do n't see why any Englishman , or Englishwoman , would volunteer to do a home - video - style schlock flick like this . Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls ? Usually , I think people are too hard on directors and actors . Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing , acting and cinematography departments . Even when you watch a movie like " Glitter " you ca n't honestly say it looks like a third - grader shot those scenes ( though a third - grader could 've written the script ) . I 've seen home movies that are shot better than " Witchcraft X , " and that 's no exaggeration whatsoever . Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City . Not a single effort was put into making this movie -- let 's just sum it up like that . You get the picture . There 's a good deal of nudity , though that does n't save it . However , I must say that girl with the red - orange hair , who 's either naked or wearing a cleavage - popping outfit throughout the film , is really hot ! < br /><br />My score : 1 ( out of 10 )
0 Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles . This film is fantastic . Vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter . Plan 9 From OUterSpace dons't stand a chance against this . Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece- he 's from England and thoroughly sarcastic.<br /><br />It has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know what s going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her . Though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers . And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira . The whole thing is badly done.<br /><br />Watch it for the script though
0 " Mistress of the Craft " Celeste works as an agent for the London branch of Interpol 's Bureau 17 , which specializes in ( I think ) occult criminals . She possesses the Eye of Destiny , good in her hands , dangerous if anyone else got it.<br /><br />Bureau 17 has caught a Satanist from California , Hyde ( no relation to Dr. Jekyll ) . Detective Lucy Lutz of LAPD flies to England to bring him back to the US . Lutz is the connection to the earlier Witchcraft movies , having been played by Stephanie Beaton before in Witchcraft 9 . In part 7 , Lutz was played by another woman ; in 6 , Lutz was a man!<br /><br />Lutz 's part in 9 was not terribly big , but she 's one of the main stars in this one . Though she 's left behind her high heels and short skirts , she still has revealing tops in this one . And this time around she has nude and sex scenes . Beaton is pretty appealing in the role.<br /><br />As usual , there are a number of sex scenes . An anonymous clubgoer has a fatal threesome with two vampires , the Satanist and head vampire get it on with some kink , Lutz finds an English pal , and Celeste and her boyfriend make love.<br /><br />The main recurring character of the Witchcraft series , Will Spanner , does not appear in this one , although Lutz mentions him to Bureau 17 agent Dixon in a conversation about vampires . She also phones her partner Detective Garner ( parts 6 , 7 , and 9 ) , though we do n't hear his end of the conversation.<br /><br />Hyde is sprung from jail by a group of vampires led by Raven , for a Walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named Morsheba ( I think ) . Hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner , while Raven overacts to a campy degree . The fight scenes are terribly choreographed.<br /><br />The audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded , and poorly edited . Additionally , some dialogue gets lost under blaring music or sirens . Cinematography is n't great either . Having the movie set in and actually shot in the UK was a bit of a novelty though , at least for this series.<br /><br />Wendy Cooper is very good as Celeste ; attractive , certainly , but more importantly she 's easily the best actor in the movie ( bad fight scenes notwithstanding ) . I 'm quite surprised her filmography is so small . If there 's ever a Witchcraft XIV , and I would bet there will be , they should bring her back , even if it means flying her to California!<br /><br />Witchcraft X is available on its own , or in the DVD collection Hotter Than Hell along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies .
0 Yeah i saw the rough cuts . The unedited sex scenes . The dire cut scenes . Almost on a par with the film ' The Need ' for awful acting . This movie is as bad as bad films get.the bad script , bad acting , bad effects , bad locations , bad stunts bad everything . The best ' actors ' in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras!<br /><br />Sean Harry , the ' foppish actor ' as someone else put it , makes a matchstick look talented here . His amazing ability to badly drive a car , when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet ( check out the reflection in the windscreen ) , his inability to turn left , which is class . OH and do n't forget the sex scene . plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys could n't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun . The other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines . It was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that was n't there!<br /><br />The ' special effects ' were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits!<br /><br />If you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and do n't give money to people who do n't deserve it .
0 I still ca n't believe how bad this movie was . If I was n't a massochist I do n't know if I would have survived the viewing . It looks like it cost about $ 1000 to make , but it was n't the money that brought them down . The acting was horrid - not just bad , 3rd graders could have read the lines better . Second , the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin , and that is sorely lacking in this flick . We do n't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff . < br /><br />Ahh well , better luck next time eh ?
0 Generally I like horror movies , but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand . We sat down to watch it , ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much . The concept is n't that bad , but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky I do n't know . The worst thing about the movie is the actors . The camera work was poor , the special effects are actually not bad if I am being generous , but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm . They were wooden beyond measure , especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent . He looked more like a public school boy in fact . There was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical , but then I remembered it was n't supposed to be a comedy . I 'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts , but there simply is n't . Let 's hope ten was the lucky number and they do n't do another one , I 'm not sure my ribs could take it .
0 MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately . Praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent , even from the people involved in making it . This film was loathed from day one . While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds ( aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism ) , the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do . It 's not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE , or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS . < br /><br />Undoubtedly the reason is that the film , though outrageously awful , is not lovable , or even likable . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is just plain mean . As a Hollywood satire it is cold - blooded and mean - spirited , but in a hollow pointless way . MYRA takes for granted that Hollywood is a corrupt town , but goes further to attack such beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy , Shirley Temple , Judy Garland and Gary Cooper . The film seems to imply that everything about Hollywood is by its very nature vile . It seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows , but does n't supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place . The film is also viscously anti - American and anti - establishment and anti - this and anti - that , but all in a superficial , late-1960 's , trendy way . Like CASINO ROYALE ; SKI - DOO ; I LOVE YOU , ALICE B. TOKLAS and other would - be hip epics , MYRA is a middle - aged vision of the hippy - dippy youth culture . It tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles . But instead of being cheerfully self - mocking , MYRA makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has the humor of a bully ; there 's not a single moment of innocence in it . Its intentions are n't honorable . TIME magazine aptly described it as being " about as funny as a child molester , " but it 's not nearly as sympathetic.<br /><br />For instance , poor Mae West bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film , being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse . The octogenarian star obviously did n't know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great - grandsons . But , director Michael Sarne had to know , but he used her anyway . Why ? Because , she apparently was the joke . Just like John Huston , John Carradine , Grady Sutton , Andy Devine and other veteran performers in the film , they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images . They are cast as smarmy self - parodies , as is Rex Reed , the arrogant , fey film critic , who is cast as just that in the film . But the real Reed , the celebrity hound , jet - setting , talk show gossip , can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way ; but as Myron , Myra 's alter ego , he is just obnoxious . Again , apparently for Sarne , Reed is the joke.<br /><br />You watch MYRA BRECKINRIDGE and you do n't see actors , you see victims . None more so than Raquel Welch . No one will ever accuse Welch of being a great actress , but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered . Being in almost every scene , Welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film , but to her credit , she gives a remarkably nuanced performance . Though , of course , centered between the scenery chewing Huston and the almost catatonic West , Welch does n't have to do much to strike a good balance . Even so , she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk , with just the hint of self - righteous glee that would do any James Bond villain proud . Legend has it that Welch was snubbed by a condescending West and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director Sarne , not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another , making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance.<br /><br />The film 's only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film 's agenda is . The whole story is a fantasy fable , which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver , but what that might be is anybody 's guess . With all of its talk about destroying " the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race , " it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind . But as a feminist , Myra is a monstrous figure , a sexual predator . Besides , Myra is n't a woman , rather she is a delusion of Myron , who presumably is a gay male . That might explain the male rape scene as well as the character 's love / hate attitude toward the macho , seemingly straight , deadhead Rusty , but it does n't explain his / her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with Farrah Fawcett 's Mary Ann . The film is obsessed with sex , but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution ; all the sex is treated as being , if not dirty , than at least perverse and degrading . Turning to Gore Vidal 's original novel is n't of any help , because it is as confused and pointless as the movie.<br /><br />And this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies . Not just movies as a business , but movies as part of the culture as well . The film itself is wall - to - wall arcane references to old movies , all of which director - screenwriter Sarne approaches with a seething disdain . He has raided the film vaults of 20th Century - Fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films , not as an homage or to provide a social commentary , but to mock the innocence of old Hollywood . How can an artist -- if you generously want to call Sarne that -- make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in ? The very effort is totally self - defeating.<br /><br />MYRA BRECKINRIDGE does n't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty . It hates Hollywood , it hates America , it hates sex , it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and , well , you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it . In a very sad and sorry way , MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto , a celebration of pop culture nihilism .
0 Seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970 , MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions . Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package , it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released . < br /><br />Gore Vidal 's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement . Most filmmakers felt that the novel 's story , structure , and overall tone would not translate to film , and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen . But studio executives soon had cold feet : Vidal 's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer - director Michael Sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen.<br /><br />Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film , but Sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves . Rewrite upon rewrite followed . The cast , sensing disaster , became increasingly combative . In her DVD commentary , star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myra 's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself , and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film . In the accompanying " Back Story " documentary , Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.<br /><br />The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself . The basics of Vidal 's story are there , but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications , it seems to have no point in and of itself . Everything runs off in multiple directions , nothing connects , and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had . And while director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce , the only laughs generated are accidental.<br /><br />Chief among these accidents is Mae West . It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one - liner -- but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies , and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling , to say the least . But worse , really , is the fact that West is outside her era . Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self - caricatures ever seen on film.<br /><br />The remaining cast is largely wasted . Raquel Welch , a significantly underestimated actress , plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids ; non - actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron , but the entire role is essentially without point . Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine , Jim Backus , William Hopper , and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed . Yes , it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be : fast when it should be slow , slow when it should be fast , relentlessly unfunny from start to finish . It is true that director Sarne does have the occasional inspired idea -- as in his use of film clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create counterpoint to the action -- but by and large , whenever Sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one.<br /><br />The how and why of that is made clear in Sarne 's audio commentary . Sarne did not like the novel or , for that matter , the subject matter in general . He did not want to write the screenplay , but he needed the money ; he emphatically did not want to direct the film , but he need the money . He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed ( at one point he flatly states that Reed " is not a nice person " ) , and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their ' homosexual agenda'--which , when you come right down to it , seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidal 's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take - off on it.<br /><br />Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community , Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people . When taken in tandem with the film itself , Sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic -- and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project.<br /><br />In addition to the Sarne and Welch commentaries and the making - of documentary , the DVD release includes several trailers and two versions of the film : a " theatrical release " version and a " restored " version . The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the " restored " version has been printed to black and white . The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored , but the documentary details what they were . The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine . But to end where I began , this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians , movie buffs , and cult movie fans . I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone , but everyone else should pass it by.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor , aka GFT , Amazon Reviewer
0 I bought this DVD without any previous reference but the names of John Huston , Raquel Welch , Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover . I found the Brazilian title very weird , but I decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like " Switch " . However the non - sense story is awful and hard to be described . Myron Breckinridge ( Rex Reed ) is submitted to a surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood telling that she is to be Myra Breckinridge ( Raquel Welch ) and claiming half the property of his uncle Buck Loner ( John Huston ) . Along the days , Myra and her alter - ego Myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle 's academy with kinky sex . In a certain moment , the messy screenplay is so confused that I believe the whole story was only a mind trip of Myron induced by the accident . Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this flick . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Homem & Mulher Até Certo Ponto " ( " Man & Woman Up to a Point " )
0 Watching this last night it amazed me that Fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment . It 's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />I'm sure that the first morning of filming Raquel Welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the Academy Award she would surely win for this daringly original movie . Oops . That 's not what happened.<br /><br />The infighting on the set was detailed in print by Rex Reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released . When it was finally released there was n't the usual three ring circus of publicity . If I remember correctly , in Houston it opened at drive - ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues.<br /><br />I lay most of the blame on director Michael Sarne , who was hot after having directed ( the not all that good ) JOANNA , a film with music about young people in swinging mod London.<br /><br />If I recall correctly , Fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could . That 's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish . An impressive supporting cast ( Kathleen Freeman , Jim Backus , John Carradine , Andy Devine and others ) is wasted with nothing to do.<br /><br />To expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from Fox movies featuring stars like Carmen Miranda ( in amazing footage from THE GANG 'S ALL HERE ) andLaurel and Hardy , who never dreamed they 'd be playing in an X rated movie.<br /><br />The X rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions ; however , none of the characters seem to be having any fun . Maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped Puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it was n't bad to exploit them.<br /><br />This was one of the " youth " pictures that nearly bankrupted Hollywood in the 1970 's . One writer joked that EASY RIDER ( which was made for pocket change ) was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success . Sixtyish , once honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger made movies like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience . White directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a Black audience . Those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never , as best I know , been out on home video or cable . They 're the studios ' deep dark secret.<br /><br />Raquel Welch 's performance in this is , all things considered , very good . With the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in . She looks great and has awesome costumes . Mae West is the liveliest seventy - something actress I 've ever seen . On the one hand it 's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by , but I 'm sure she needed the money.<br /><br />If you want to see a big budget X - rated movie from this era check out BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS ( also from Fox ) because it does n't take itself seriously . It 's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to Say Something . There just was n't anyone who wanted to listen .
0 I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film , and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970 . It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films , and this only deepened an interest , as I just had to see what made this movie so bad . Upon seeing it , I think I have my answers . Although I will say it does make for curious viewing , the acting , direction , and script are so laughingly bad , that the supposed satire is completely missing . Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film , but after the opening sequence of the sex - change operation , the film goes so far down hill that she can not handle this task alone . John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help , as he licks and leers at the screen , he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he 's doing there . Rex Reed bounces around as Myron , Myra 's alter ego , and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene . Bravo for debut performances ! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde ; she certainly seemed convincing in this role . But , of course , arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west . The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film . I do n't mean to put this cast down personally ; but in this film , no one comes out looking good . The direction seems so unassured and non - existent , that the film is not only bad , but boring as well . Throw in some old film footage of old stars , and the movie becomes even more disconnected . To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this , and I was glad I at least saw it , but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning .
0 Anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that I love bad movies almost as much as I love great ones , and I can honestly say that I have finally seen one of the all - time legendary bad movies : the almost indescribable mess that is MYRA BRECKINRIDGE . An adaptation of Gore Vidal 's best - selling book ( he later disowned this film version ) , the star - studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end . The X - rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it 's release . Not surprisingly , the film went on to gain a near - legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema , and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time.<br /><br />Director Michael Sarne ( who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time ) , took a lot of flack for the finished film , and , in honesty , it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve . The film is often incoherent , with entire sequences edited together in such a half - hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible . Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals . This means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple laced into newly - film scenes of often lewd sexual acts , and the process just does n't work as intended ( this also caused a minor uproar , as actors such as Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio for using their image without permission).<br /><br />Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame , however , as the film 's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief . For instance , this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex Reed ( in his first and last major film role ) could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel Welch ? ! The film becomes further hard to follow when Welch as Myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle ( played by legendary film director John Huston ) , seduce a nubile female film student ( Farrah Fawcett ) , and teach the school 's resident bad boy ( Roger Herren ) a lesson by raping him with a strap - on dildo . Did everyone follow that ? < br /><br />And it gets even better ( or worse , depending upon your perspective ) ! I have yet to mention the film 's top - billed star : the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen - thirties , Mae West ! Ms. West was 77 year old when she appeared in this film ( she had been retired for 26 years ) , and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men ( including a young Tom Selleck ) throwing themselves at her . As if this were n't bad enough , the tone - deaf West actually performs two newly - written songs about halfway through the film , and I think that I might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them ! < br /><br />Naturally , none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as " good , " but I would give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when I had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on . Also , most of the cast tries really hard . Raquel , in particular , appears so hell - bent in turning her poorly - written part into something meaningful that she single - handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching . If she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is also fine . The endearingly over - the - top John Huston ( who really should have been directing the picture ) has some funny moments , Rex Reed is n't bad for a non - actor , and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh - faced and likable . Roger Herren is also fine , but he never appeared in another movie again after this ( I guess he just could n't live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch ) . And as anyone could guess from the description above , Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but that 's part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema .
0 It was the Sixties , and anyone with long hair and a hip , distant attitude could get money to make a movie . That 's how Michael Sarne , director of this colossal flop , was able to get the job . Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie . In fact , the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film , a terribly precious 60's - hip black and white featurette called Joanna . That film starred the similarly talentless actress / waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat - like twitter . Sarne , who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon , never mind a big - budget Hollywood film , was in way over his head . David Giler 's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux - infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone 's eyes . If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era , Myra Breckinridge provides that marker . It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea - change in the body politic . Breckinridge is a touchstone of another , equally important vein . Watch this movie and you 'll get a different perspective on the less - often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.<br /><br />Many reviewers have spoken about the inter - cutting of footage from other films , especially older ones . Some actually liked these clunky " comments " on what was taking place in the movie , others found them senseless , annoying , and obtrusive , though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement . < br /><br />In my opinion , the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed . That is to say , Sarne was so imagination - challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time . They were n't inspiration , they were desperation . His writing skills were nonexistent , and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb , so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie , and he could n't . It was beyond his slim capabilities . Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film 's worth of clips . The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck was n't able to . This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew ( not to mention the producers and the accountants ) cooled their heels and waited for something , some great spark of imagination , a hint of originality , a soupcon of wit , to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus . Um , oops . No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window . Bye - bye . < br /><br />As for myself , I hated the film clips . They denigrated Sarne 's many betters , poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration , originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them .
0 This hodge - podge adapted from a Gore Vidal novel ( actually one of the great American writers ) makes THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS look like Fellini art - works . Raquel Welch , with an incredible body ( and she 's actually not very tall ) in a lead role ( except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was quite good ) playing Rex Reed 's ( bad movie reviewer ; not critic ) alter - ego , only to be surrounded by drag queen ( great chick ) Mae West , horny John Huston , a young and " naive " Farrah Fawcett ( pre - Lee Majors ; what a shame ) , and other various creep - azoids to pretend to spoof WAY too may things has nothing going for it except inter - spliced old films clips ( i.e. Widmark in KISS OF DEATH , Lena Horne) ... JUST so they can continue to bleed the life out of everyone.<br /><br />A 2 out of 10 . Best performance = ? . It 's so bad , it 's worth seeing !
0 THAT 'S certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested . And it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio , given that ( 1 ) The feuds between the cast were well known long before the movie 's release . ( 2 ) The feud between the Producer(Robert Fryer ) and Director ( Michael Sarne ) was also common knowledge . ( 3 ) The cast made no secret of their contempt for the film and made it public at every opportunity , with daily bulletins from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnists everywhere.<br /><br />And ( 4 ) The author , Gore Vidal hated it practically from day one . Nevertheless , that tagline just about sums it up . Raquel Welch does < br /><br />give a decent performance as Myra , and she looks lovely besides . John Huston is very funny as Buck Loner , the ex - Cowboy Star who runs a phony acting academy . Mae West , ( in her first screen appearance since 1943 ) naturally rewrote her part to suit herself , and she is great as ' ' oversexed '' ( and that 's putting it mildly ) ' ' Talent Agent '' Leticia Van Allen . Still , she must have wondered ( after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return ) how she ever ended up in this mess.<br /><br />Tom Selleck ( in his film debut ) is one of her ' ' clients '' . John Carradine and Jim Backus , as Doctors , also amble in briefly . Rex Reed as Myron , Farrah Fawcett and Roger Herren , as the victims of Myra / Myron 's sexual passion , are neither here nor there . The same goes for the script , which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book , but seems to head in at least three different directions at once . Although West 's part was originally larger , she was reduced to a cameo role by the time Sarne was through with the editing . And , partly because of this , she seems to be in a different movie . Apparently , at some point , the Producers realized that Mae was going to be the film 's big draw , and , unable to replace most of her cut footage , they rushed her back to the set at the end of filming for the second of her two songs , both of which come out of nowhere . The device Sarne used of throwing in old film clips of bygone stars to emphasize whatever points he was making , does n't work at all . By the time the movie concludes , all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about . Not surprisingly , just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way , and it died at the box office . A technically flawless DVD includes , ( among other extras ) separate commentaries from both Welch and Sarne , each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrong . No doubt it 's home video re - release was prompted by a 2001 '' Vanity Fair '' piece , which attempted ( in great detail ) to do the same thing . True , the structure of the novel made a screen adaptation a dubious undertaking , but , with Sarne at the helm of what was obviously a ' ' troubled '' production , it really never had a chance .
0 Myron Breckinridge ( Rex Reed ! ! ! ) gets a sex change from a doctor ( John Carradine -- dead drunk ) and comes out as Myra ( Raquel Welch ) . She then decides to destroy male masculinity ( or something like that ) and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous John Huston ( do n't ask ) and break up a young happy couple ( young , handsome , hunky Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett -- yes THE Farrah Fawcett ) . < br /><br />They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that was unfilmable and , naturally , tried to film it . They also hired an English guy with a decidedly Anti - American attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable " talent " ( Welch , Reed ) and embarassed old professionals ( Huston , Carradine , Andy Devine , Jim Backus , Mae West ) , threw it all together and .... SURPRISE ! ! ! An absolute disaster . < br /><br />The film got an X rating at its release ( it 's been lowered to an R ) , mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty ( Roger Herren ) and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett.<br /><br />The movie is very scattershot ... scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense . It 's not good at all but I was never bored . < br /><br />Acting varies wildly ... Reed is horrible ... really sad . Huston chews the scenery again and again and AGAIN to a nauseating extreme . Welch is actually not bad as Myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her . West is hardly in the movie ( a blessing ) and it 's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes . Roger Herren ( whatever happened to ... ) was very young , handsome and not bad as Rusty . Fawcett is OK.<br /><br />It 's hard to find things to say about this ... you just watch it in disbelief . A must see movie -- to believe ! ! ! !
0 I saw " Myra Breckinridge " when it first came out in 1970 . I was a healthy 20-year - old at the time , who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh . On top of that , I had read the Gore Vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny . I saw the movie at a local drive - in and about half way through I was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe I 'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie . It was n't " smart " or " trendy " , it was gross and sloppy . All the actors were tone deaf and the director did n't have the slightest idea what he was doing . The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history . As one reviewer here said , her role had nothing to do with the movie or book . Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud , which would never do for the legendary Ms. West . Oh no , the plot is changed so she sexually beats HIM up , very believable from a 77-year - old woman who looks every DAY of her age . I could go on , but why ? It was an awful movie.<br /><br />Bluto
0 I never much liked the Myra movie , tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time . Certainly Miss Welch 's costume became an iconic image , though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about -<br /><br />I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and did n't think it had aged any better thru the years . There 's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books , where it 's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production . However , IMHO , the movie is too bitter to be charming , too silly to be a turn - on , and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform , engage , OR entertain ---
0 It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years . For me the main problem 's the uneven script.<br /><br />While some of it is witty and hip , quite a bit of it is dull , unfunny and lifeless . Many of the gags just sit there , lacking spark and energy.<br /><br />Of the cast , Mae West and Rachel Welch come over well . Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines ( too bad he did n't make more films ) . But for my money , there 's just too much of John Huston , and poor Rex Reed is n't hardly given a fighting chance . His character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines , wondering what he 's doing in this film.<br /><br />The low user rating should give an idea as to the public 's opinion of this piece . Vidal 's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted . Not even the ' classic ' film clips did much . All in all a rather sub par effort , and it 's not likely to get much better with time .
0 Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier , Mike Sarne was given " the biggest train set in the world"to play with , but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe . Despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract , the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today . How anyone given the resources at Mr Sarne 's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret . Only Michael Cimino ever came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes " Heaven 's Gate".Both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio 's largesse , whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather fey " Joanna " in his locker . Furthermore,"Heaven 's Gate " could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where , tragically,"Myra Breckinridge"s cupboard was bare . Simply put , it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of Hollywood .
0 Two old men sitting on a park bench . I don`t really have a problem with this scene - Only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movie < br /><br />Yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this . They also don`t get anymore boring than this either , but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese . One is Nat Moyer who is Yiddish communist while the other is Midge Carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black . Let me see now , a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine . Well I guess it`s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the Jewish stereotype ? Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths ? Slightly ironic that the Jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s < br /><br />Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it`s based on a stage play and it shows . Walter Matthau sleepwalks through his role as Nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
0 The premise of an African - American female Scrooge in the modern , struggling city was inspired , but nothing else in this film is . Here , Ms. Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits . There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved . Part of the problem is that story 's roots do n't translate well into the urban setting of this film , and the script fails to make the update work . Also , the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly , the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end . This is a message film that does n't know when to quit . In the title role , the talented Cicely Tyson gives an overly uptight performance , and at times lines are difficult to understand . The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times , it 's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant , in spite of its very relevant message .
0 ... but this has to be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time . And that takes some doing , what with the likes of various Lifetime efforts . Do n't get me wrong -- I have nothing against Cicely Tyson . I 've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles ( look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes , for example ) . But the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery . And chew it she does , with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tying into a Christmas goose.<br /><br />Give me the classics anytime : Alastair Sim , 1951 . With the exception maybe of Scrooged , all the others are just over - the - top efforts to grasp the past , present , or future Spirit of Christmas .
0 I first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my TiVo system . I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting . On top of that , I 'm a fan of Max Fleischer 's work , and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon . With both of those , I thought it would hold my interest . I was wrong . Just a few minutes in , and I had the fast forward button down . I ran through it in about 15 minutes , and thought that was it.<br /><br />Afterwards , I read some of the other reviews here and figured I did n't give it enough of a chance . I recorded it again and watched it through . There 's 75 minutes of my life I 'm not getting back.<br /><br />I ca n't believe there are n't more bad reviews . Personally , I think it 's because it 's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum . How many ways are there to say this is a waste of time?<br /><br />The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts , profanity , and puke jokes . The characters are flat . The parody of " Swinging the Alphabet " is lame , essentially cobbling the tune , getting through A - E , hitting the obvious profanity a " F " , and then having no idea where to go . The trip through the intestines to the expected landing does n't work the first time , let alone the following ones . < br /><br />Across the board , the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to " out - South Park " Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and is n't funny . This might be amusing if you 're high . Otherwise , it 's not .
0 ... thankfully he has n't , yet ! This is crude , simplistic student politics made into drama . It needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits . Conceit 1 : That a British electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left . Conceit 2 : That all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new Prime Minister 's only critics are sinister civil servants , MI5 , big business and the Americans ( naturally ) . Conceit 3 : That this radical socialist PM can solve all union , economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation . Conceit 4 : That severing all ties with the US and NATO is a good thing . Conceit 5 : That the Soviet Union is n't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80 's . And finally , Conceit 6 : That the reactionary forces of the US would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against Britain.<br /><br />It 's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti - Thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing TV critics singing its praises . When it was made , television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience . Ray McInally 's performance was great , which is one of the few plus points . History and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show .
0 The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche 's work and personality , psychoanalytical techniques and Vienna 's history . Take a well - know genius you have not read , describe him as demented , include crazy physicians to cure him , a couple of somewhat good looking women , have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache , have every character speak with the strongest accent , show ridiculous dreams , include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one ( Freud ) , mention a few words used in the genius ' works , overdo everything you can , particularly music , and you are done . Audience , please stay away .
0 I rented this DVD having seen it while looking for something else . When I saw the title on the jacket I could n't believe my eyes . I read Yalom 's book about a year ago and loved it , in fact admire Yalom 's work in general . ( I am a clinical psychologist . ) I have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off . I 'm not sure if I can take much more . At a superficial level , the faux accents , as others have commented , are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst . The acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious . The portrayal of Lou Salome is simply flippant , and the brilliant Freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy . I see very little of the book 's spirit conveyed thus far . I had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students . Instead , I will refer them to the book . Imagine that .
0 My comments on this movie have been deleted twice , which i find pretty offending , since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people . Please be tolerant of other people 's opinion . Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood , so ill change my comment completely.<br /><br />I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.<br /><br />Subject : one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions . One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker . So making a movie about his life , which obviously includes his ' ideas ' is a thing one should be extremely careful with , or preferably , do n't do at all . Wisdom starts with knowing what you do n't know . One might think this is not a review of the movie itself , but the movie is not about an imaginary character , it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had / has great influence on the world of yesterday , today and tomorrow . If someone tells a story about a tomato , i can express my thoughts about the story itself , but also about the chosen subject , the tomato . There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts . Specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken.<br /><br />Screenplay : One of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents . Why ? It distracts from what it should be about ; Nietzsche and the truths he found . It does n't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time ! Come on , make it proper English or better yet ; German ! Even Mel Gibson got that part right ... letting his characters speak some gibberish Aramaic in the Passion.<br /><br />Secondly , it is well over - acted.<br /><br />3d , Assante is not an actor to depict Nietzsche . Bad casting.<br /><br />4th , facts are way off.<br /><br />And so on . Its a waste of celluloid .
0 I had to stop watching this film ( a pseudo - intellectual product for pretentious film viewers ) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns , not to mention that I was soon near tears over the $ 3.99 I had wasted at Blockbuster . Joanna Pacula 's acting and her awfully rendered Slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one 's teeth . I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many . Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents . While we 're on the topic of talent , Breuer 's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe . She clearly has not learned her craft . In fact , she 's really quite awful . All the public scenes looked staged , with the extras walking mechanically about in their Sunday best . Turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on . Do n't rent this terrible movie . You will be sorry you spent your money .
0 When I first tuned in on this morning news , I thought , " wow , finally , some entertainment . " It was slightly amusing for a week or so ... But we have to face it , these news reporters ( if one can even call them that ) have WAY TOO MUCH " playing around " time.<br /><br />At first , I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air . But seriously , this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her . She is very unprofessional . She keeps on interrupting Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report . It 's just really become annoying to the point that I ca n't watch it anymore.<br /><br />Jillian is NOT a good journalist . Hell , she 's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity . Hence , she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she 's supposed to be interviewing . She 's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that 's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also ( disappointingly ) , this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world , the government , the US , or something that will benefit and/or serve the public 's best interest . They 're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product . On the other hand , their field reporters are interestingly tolerable ... <br /><br />I believe " Good Day LA " is for young teenagers and celebrities , and it is definitely not for people who actually CARE about the news.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE : ( I 'd really rather watch KTLA . However , they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes . They 're still a bit dull though . Oh well , I 'll stick to NBC 's " Today . " ABC 's " Good Morning America " is also okay ... as long as Diane Sawyer does n't become way too serious . )
0 Dark Rising is your typical bad , obviously quickly produced horror / sci - fi / fantasy movie . It has a strange , unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them . Most of the time I did n't know what the hell was going on but it did n't really matter , it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason . The acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script I am guessing . There is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made ( like so many other bad movies ) . Give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on T.V.
0 This is one of those horror flicks where twenty - somethings fool around with the dark arts around a camp fire , getting into a heap of trouble for doing so . A portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the Kelippoth of the Sitra Achra by a man whose daughter , Summer , gets kidnapped by something , taken into it . Summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters . This is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny . Anyway , three wannabee witches , who went to high school together , Renea , the most enthusiastic , serious practitioner in the dark arts , and her lesbian cohorts , Jasmine and Marlene( .. it 's more or less a passing fad with them , though .. ) join up with buddies , Jason and Ricky , on a trip in the wilderness where Summer vanished from her home ten years ago . Opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book , a demon is set free , as is Summer , now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world.<br /><br />Low budget contains a loopy , but ambitious story , restraining it into a confined setting . These young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast . As can be the case in these movies , the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as Summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass , while befriending Jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time . The action is shot mostly in the dark , making any violence hard to decipher . Brigitte Kingsley(and the rest of the female cast for that matter ) , is some mighty nice eye candy , dressed scantily clad as a female Conan , a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie . Some lesbianism( .. some kissing and fondling)and nudity spice things up nicely , and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot .. it 's so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material.<br /><br />Might be of interest for co - starring World Wrestling Entertainment 's " Captain Courageous " Christian(real name , Jason Reso)as one of the group , spoofing his alter ego , as a chicken , quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig . Landy Cannon is likable as unlikely hero , Jason , a lovestruck , naive young man whose ex - fiancé , Jasmine(Vanessa James)is now bi - sexual and in love with Marlene( .. Jasmine 's cruelty is in toying with Jason 's feelings by hiding her affair with Marlene from his knowledge ) , while Ricky and Renea attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can rekindle a dead flame that gone out , never to ignite again . The Kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit , I guess to refrain from showing how ludicrous / laughable it looks if presented in full . The lesbian antics of Jasmine and Marlene(Haley Shannon ) is mostly tame , their love making , once alone in the woods up against a tree , is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night . My rating is a bit favorable towards it , almost solely because of Kingsley , for purely superficial reasons , rather than the plot or film - making . The movie aims to please and is marketed to the boys(and girls who love hot women ) . I think , though , for the most part , the humor falls a bit flat .
0 This film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot . The entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends ( including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner ... another girl ... that 's right they 're lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason ) . Unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through . Also unfortunately , none of this is ever explained . Where exactly were they ? Where did the demon come from ? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons ? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit ? The acting is terrible I think but it 's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it . I give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap . I would not recommend it , it was n't quite bad enough to be funny .
0 This movie is lame and not funny at all . The plot does n't even make sense . Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension ( maybe hell ? ? ? ) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something , then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit ( I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her ? ) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she 's more interested in her new girlfriend , and they stumble upon this witch spell book ( they want to be witches or something ? ? ? ) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently . There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary , obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie . I 'm sure the topless girls does n't hurt there either . The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie , I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing . Who are these people and what are they doing ? Basically this is a go - camping - to - make - out - then - fight - a - monster movie but there are a bunch of things ( like the other dimension and book seller ) than make it confusing . I did n't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal . I do n't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid , I ca n't think of any part of the movie that was good .
0 This series was CBS networks answer to the success of the Big Valley . It was a 90 minute Western just like the ABC program was . While it was an answer , it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2.<br /><br />The problem really became reality got lost on this show . For example- in one episode , Johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick . Amazingly , by the end of the show , Johnny had healed entirely . Along with that , the stories on this were no where near as strong as The Big Valley.<br /><br />This is a show that I would not want DVDs of , & frankly hope they are never released . Think since CBS was running out of lots , they re - used many familiar settings . This was one the last western series CBS produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970 's .
0 I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a " character study " type of movie , so I struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the Stop button.<br /><br />Even with a character study theme , I just could not get into this film at all . Perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else , or maybe I had other expectations , but setting that aside , I tried my best to move on to finish watching , but gave up . The actors played their roles well , but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest . About the only interesting thing was the sergeant 's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one , and spray painted it black to appear as police issue . I think this movie should have been entitled , " Who Stole the Sergeant 's Gun ? " Scenes were well done but putting them together I once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.<br /><br />Since I did n't finish watching it I 'd say there is some merit to renting this film ... maybe . To me , it was a waste of good viewing effort and time . I 'll leave it up to you to try it , but it 's not one I 'd strongly recommend .
0 This is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie . I highly recommend The Prophecy , but this movie was a dud from the start . The acting was decent all the way around , but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional . A 4 out of 10 at best .
0 Everybody knows that Gregory Widen 's original " The Prophecy " did n't really require a sequel , but you also do n't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash - ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable . Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight - to - video sequel , meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action , more witty one - liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery . The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel , and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental . If it was n't for Walken 's performance ( and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig ) , " The Prophecy II " surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release . The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth . The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales ( Jennifer Beals ) from getting born . For you see , her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly " monkey " and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel 's evil dominion . Thus , just as in the first movie , he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown . " The Prophecy II " is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you do n't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity . Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious , the makers luckily enough always insert a near - brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you . His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences . On a slightly off - topic note , I often felt like " The Prophecy II " ambitions to look similar to " Terminator II "   Gabriel 's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location , where the final battle takes place , looks very similar to the steel factory where " Terminator II " ended as well . Coincidence , I guess ? Overall , this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you 're a fan of Christopher Walken 's unique acting charisma ( and who is n't ? ) .
0 I personally liked " The Prophecy " of 1995 a lot . Christopher Walken was , as always , great , and even though the film was n't flawless , it was a creepy and highly original Horror / Fantasy film that entertained immensely . This inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching , but mainly due to Walken . Walken is one of the greatest actors around , in my opinion , and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel , whom he plays for the second time here . Once again , the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth . Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child , namely the child of the angel Danyael ( Russel Wong ) and the human woman Valerie ( Jennifer Beals ) . This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war ... As I said above , Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel . Besides Gabriel , however , " The Prophecy II " sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters . The character of Valerie was annoying enough , and Danayel annoyed me even more . The biggest pain in the ass , however was the character of Izzy ( played by Brittany Murphy ) , a suicidal girl who would n't shut up . Still , Walken 's performance is n't the only redeeming quality of the film . The entire film is quite dreary , and well - shot in dark colors , which contributes a lot to the atmosphere . Gabriel 's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive , and one of the coolest moments in any of the " Prophecy " films . " The Prophecy II " is nevertheless the weakest of the three " Prophecy " films with Walken . Definitely a Christopher Walken one - man - show , entertaining , but nothing beyond that .
0 The Prophecy II , what 's there to say about it ? They 've completely abandoned the originality of the first film , and simply made a Chris Walken splatter film . It 's not even written by the original writer!<br /><br />If you 've seen Nr . 1 do n't watch Nr . 2 it 's a real disappointment ... <br /><br />If you have n't seen Nr . 1 do n't watch Nr . 2 ! Go see Nr . 1 to experience something original and fun
0 It 's not often I feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film ; after all I often feel the maxim , " if you do n't have anything good to say do n't say it at all , " would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like . If it 's all the same to you the reader though I feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of Christopher Walken in a returning role as Gabriel this movie is pathetically HORRID . I say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of Walken 's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original " Prophecy " that you will be sorely dissapointed . If you buy it , return it . If you rent it , make sure it 's only ninety - nine cents.<br /><br />What 's wrong with this movie ? A full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears , but a short summary would be the following : the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds . Gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of God he once was ( and in this role he is WICKEDLY funny in the first ) to little more than a thug for heaven . Since Walken is so good at playing heavies ( we all remember Frank White from " King of New York " ) he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who could n't buy a clue for 50 cents . If you can figure out the plot you 're a smarter man than I. One gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to Walken 's next big line . By the end of the movie you 're actually wishing he 'd blow his horn and make the walls of Jericho fall on the people who made this un - natural disaster.<br /><br />Bottom line - it 's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place . The original told the right story , answered the questions that should have been , and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards . There are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first - the priest who lost his faith , the little girl who kept the " big secret " , the teacher who protected her children - even Lucifer himself was more interesting BY himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together . I feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they 'll probably never want to watch the original and that 's a real tragedy .
0 I 'll make this short and sweet .... this movie sucked!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever , gave it 9 out of 10 stars . So I thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels , I was wrong . This movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one , it had the plot continue and that s it . It was like bad outtakes from part one or something.<br /><br />I love Walken , but I felt sorry for him here . I was so happy about Glenn Danzig being in this film , but do n't blink you 'll miss him . There was a full cast full of crappy actors and people I do n't like such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals . However , it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry , he 's one of the funniest people on earth.<br /><br />This movie will make you like the first one a little less , so do n't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself , being a fan of part 1 . I am gon na wait a few days before I watch part 3 and I pray it is better than this crap.<br /><br />The last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film . Fast forward or skip to that if you ca n't stomach the first part.<br /><br />1 out of 10 stars - this was awful !
0 I liked the first movie , but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board . The general idea in the first movie was , if not great , then at least very interesting . This sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie , and though Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel , the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous . If you have n't seen any of these movies , then get the first movie and forget about the sequels , they can take away all of the joy from the original .
0 Where is it written that sequels must suck ? Scream 2 did n't ! Others did n't ! But this one sure did ... problems include horrible actors ( only Christopher Walken could act in the entire film ) , bad writing ( you will never understand what 's going on and I even have done research on the idea of Nephilim before ) , and just horrible choices for casting . Eric Roberts makes the stupidest Archangel Michael that I have ever seen in my life!<br /><br />Avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see Christopher Walken . In that case just fast - forward to the parts where he is in the film , and avoid the others.<br /><br />Yech ! ! !
0 Can fake scenery ruin a picture ? You would n't think so , but it actually for me in here . Listen , I have a lot of classic - era movies and I know pretty much what to except , such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen , etc . But a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes . To have fake scenery , fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in " Brigadoon " gets insulting after awhile . < br /><br />As far as the music entertainment went , this is always subjective . What songs one person likes , another may not so that should n't be a big part of judging a film ( whether someone likes the songs ) . I could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs , dances , romances and characters but that was the ' 50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things . Musicals did very well in the ' 50s . Me , I liked the ' 30s and ' 40s with the great taps . By the ' 50s , tap was out and this new stuff - which I can stand - was it . Does that make this a lousy movie ? No . It just makes one I did n't care for very much < br /><br />Despite the good cast , good director and high expectations , this film bombed at the box office , and with me . I should have liked it more , being a dreamer myself and that 's a nice part of this story . I am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal . Then why could n't I connect with this film ? Part of it also was the dancing . I do n't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen . But - no - the thing really turned me off what that staging . There was no Scotland , no highlands , just a hokey- looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start . Score one point for today 's realism where they " go on location " most of the time .
0 I remember when I first saw this movie , I was in sixth grade when it happened . Before I saw this , i had listened to the original Broadway recording of it , and I really loved it ! But when I saw this , I was like , what the heck ? ! This movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud ! Who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />I really am a very huge fan of Gene Kelly , but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did ! The movie looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland . And who the heck decided to cut all of Meg 's songs out of the movie ? ! < br /><br />I am willing to bet that when they saw this movie , Lerner and Lowe were probably wondering : " Who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece ? " Well they had a right to say that if they did , they were probably mad at the fact that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie.<br /><br />Song and acting wise Mr. Kelly , you passed the audition with flying colors , but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text.<br /><br />So in short , if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner , this one is n't it ! < br /><br />3/10
0 I saw Brigadoon on TV last night ( 12 Sept 2009 ) . I am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as I can remember . I can truthfully say that Brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film I have ever seen . The accents were shameful . The local children 's club would have produced better sets . The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . The owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .
0 Superficically , " Brigadoon " is a very promising entertainment package . Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli , the team behind " An American in Paris " , are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . Gene 's leading lady is Cyd Charisse , one of the best dancers of 40s/50s cinema , and unlike the generally superior " It 's Always Fair Weather " this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . Lerner and Loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as " My Fair Lady " and Minnelli 's musical masterpiece " Gigi " ; Lerner and Minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent " American in Paris." < br /><br />What happened along the way ? Why is the movie itself such a stupid bore ? Minnelli himself did n't want to do the movie , despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with Lerner . Maybe it was because the movie 's innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for MGM and one step backward for Vincente Minnelli . But once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of Brigadoon are trapped within its city limits , Minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting , if not liberating way . The ultimate result is truly horrific to behold.<br /><br />While aiming for the naive charm of previous Minnelli hits like " Cabin in the Sky " and " Meet Me in St. Louis " , the plaid - tights wearing inhabitants of Brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never - have - been locales . Its whimsy does n't even match up to the glossy luster of " Yolanda and the Thief " or " The Pirate " because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . The only people in Brigadoon who I at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow - traveler played by Van Johnson who accidentally shoots him . The general proceedings in the township of Brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of Christianity : they seem positively pagan in their aspect . For example , in exchange for Brigadoon 's immortality , the honorable and most generally " good " pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge.<br /><br />At one point we 're assured that " everybody 's looking for their own Brigadoon . " Suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us are n't looking for this kind of quasi - queasy paradise . The premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing , but could work if the players were perfect . But Kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie , and Charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as Lucille Bremer was miscast in " Yolanda and the Thief . " Van Johnson does his best version of the classic Oscar Levant sidekick to Kelly ( even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like Levant in " AIP " ) , and he provides a lot of amusing moments . But it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of MGM is a tossed - off Van Johnson performance .
0 This movie is phoniness incarnate , a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale . The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering . Yanks , although the real Scotland may be just as colourful , if you ever go there do n't expect to be given much of a the chance to " dance out " controversies with the locals . Also , do n't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing.<br /><br />There are a couple of infectious singing - and - dancing scenes , but the plot is far too cheesy and linear , and the dialogue is often too weak . I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City . Maybe it was n't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon , maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.<br /><br />Watch it for the fine alternative - reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day - parade in Scotland would look like on LSD . Other than that I 'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists .
0 Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse . Michael Hordern is good as Capulet , though it 's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear . John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence though he never takes it anywhere . Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt , in the first of his " yuk " roles that would make him famous . Christopher Strauli 's Benvolio is sympathetic.<br /><br />The sets are pretty , if not stunning as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare's.<br /><br />And that 's it . The rest is weak to dreadful . Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production , and has n't a clue about how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way . Patrick Ryecart is poorly matched to her , and his self - regard is inexplicable . The Balcony Scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact . Their deaths come as a relief . If I had a dagger , I would have offered it to them hours earlier.<br /><br />Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio , a great shock if you remember his fine work in " Brideshead Revisited . " He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare 's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each , and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible . In this production , Queen Mab abdicates . Awful.<br /><br />The director , Alvin Rakoff , shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see . The opening brawl is notably incoherent . However there is humor when in a later fight , Romeo apparently knees Tybalt right in the cobblers . Tybalt then grabs the offended region . However did that get through ? < br /><br />R&J is a long play . This version is not recommended for classroom use , or much else .
0 Have to admit , this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront ! None can act except the nurse who was my fav ! Juliet had good skills as a teen but she ca n't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her . She 's worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion ... god stop whining ! I would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up ! Anthony Andrews ... yikes ! Considering his other great movies ( Brideshead Revisited , Ivanhoe , Scarlet Pimpernel ) , he 's quite a shocker in this one . And do n't get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee ! It 's still good to see if you 're on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of film . Olivia and Leonard 's version is still the best , followed by Leslie Howard 's version and then the current Leo and Clare !
0 Easily the best known of all the Shakespeare plays , it has been seriously let down here . Shoddy direction , stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.<br /><br />In the town of Verona , the Capulets and the Montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when Romeo ( Patrick Rycart ) , a Montague , falls in love with Juliet ( Rebecca Saire ) , a Capulet . Bloodshed soon erupts ... <br /><br />The studio work , especially in daytime scenes , seriously stagnates the energy of the play . It 's a story that , with it 's energy , deserves to be shot outdoors . Coupled with this the costumes are hideous , with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . The stage fighting looks horrendous , with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging.<br /><br />Patrick Ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective Romeo . He manages the character 's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland , often inexpressive eyes limit his range . It is very hard for the audience to relate to this Romeo . Rebecca Saire is too youthful to be a good Juliet - she captures the character 's naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.<br /><br />The supporting roles do n't fare much better . Joseph O'Connor 's Friar Laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . Anthony Andrews ' Mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . He gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . Alan Rickman , underplaying his role , has virtually no presence as Tybalt . He did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years , but that is n't in evidence here . The Prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . Only Micheal Hordern , in probably his best role in this series , comes out of this with any dignity . His Capulet is well - played and a joy to watch.<br /><br />See one of the other versions of this story instead .
0 For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage , I can not believe what these people did to a perfectly good play . < br /><br />-Let 's start off with the good bit , shall we?-<br /><br />Alan Rickman is alright , although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling . The rest of the actors needed to pull it together . < br /><br />Romeo , Romeo , whyfore art thou not dead yet , Romeo ? The actor , while not only completely wooden and deadpan , could not read his lines with any gusto at all . He was completely out of focus , had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face , and absolutely NO grace with the lines that he was given . Whoever cast him deserves to be punished . Juliet is almost passable , but she gives no depth to her character , and seems to be completely out of touch with the play . Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog . Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines . < br /><br />I was forced to endure this half - baked production of Romeo and Juliet . The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting . I have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them . I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero .
0 This is the first of " The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare " BBC series I 've seen , and if all of them are like this , I might watch no more . Being practically the full text of the play is everything this " Romeo & Juliet " has going for it , lacking in all other departments . Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director , both in the technical and artistic aspects . In the former , because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . Take in consideration , for example , the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Balthasar in the opening scene , or the Nurse 's entering of Friar Lawrence 's cell , asking where 's Romeo with him being so very in front of her that she 'd clearly see him even if she was blind . And , in the latter , because every single one of the performers is misdirected , even if some of them are good actors . Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I 've always imagined Juliet to look like , and she does n't seem to be a bad actress for a teenager , but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . Patrick Ryecart as Romeo is even worse , being not only as dull as Juliet , but also way too old and not even good - looking , coming across as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and the Chucky doll . Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other , let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . Alan Rickman , in his screen debut , plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader , which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended , no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . This Tybalt is so mean - looking that we do n't believe the characters ' pity after his demise . As for Paris , I kept thinking of " Prince Valium " from Spaceballs . Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.<br /><br />At 168 minutes , this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters , because the characters do n't empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirelli 's . But , to be fair , this BBC one is n't nearly as bad as abominations like George Cukor 's flamboyant geriatric version , or the crime against Humanity that is Baz Luhrmann 's feature - length MTV video . 4/10 .
0 I rated Basic instinct 2 high , yet that movie got less than a 4 rating . This film only got a 4 from me , but it has 7.3 from over 600 people . I do n't see a reason why they like this film so much.<br /><br />This film is boring , because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in that broken big house . And it only has a total of 5 people in this film . It is almost two hours long which is totally unnecessary . Many of dialogues are slow and meaningless . The film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch . The film can just be shorten to a few sentences.<br /><br />This film reminds me of " Three times " directed by Hou Hsiao hsien , that one is equally boring , the dialogues are also equally boring . It also has a high rating ! I had to stop watching that one after the first story finished.<br /><br />This film lacks of passion or excitement .
0 Good films can not solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top . Surprised to see it has won two awards . Extremely overrated . I first saw that kind of films from China , visually stunning BUT also with really something captivating to say , well , more than 10 years ago and I 'm sure there are still more coming up . This is not one of them , I 'm afraid .
0 Not very impressed . Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film , because there is almost no development in the plot . Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . The acting seems very poor as well , and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television . Although this is difficult to tell with the female role , Yuwen , as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time . < br /><br />Tian Zhuangzhuang 's film the ' Blue Kite ' was a far better film . But do n't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late ' 40s . Unlike the Blue Kite , the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself , the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop.<br /><br />I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who ca n't tell the difference between a film that is ' beautiful ' ' profound ' or ' hypnotic ' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.<br /><br />If any film fits the description of ' overrated , ' this is it . I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry .
0 I 'll have to add dissenting comment here . Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiao - hsien . i.e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . Unfortunately this is n't quite accurate . The film plays out rather like a film school graduate 's attempt to emulate these masters . All the pieces are there - the beautiful backdrop , the vaguely minimalist dialogue , the slow swaying camerawork , and male leads , in particular , who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . The dialogue is leaden . The acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type ; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . Unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical " Chekovian " ( i.e. very predictable ) plot , the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . I could n't help but see the " Blue Danube " river scene , for example , as verging on genre parody ( although the smoggy looking " springtime " sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour ... ) I actually went to this movie on the basis that Mark Li Ping was photographing it . While the setting is elegant , and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of " Flowers of Shanghai " , the film is not in the same league , visually . In fact I must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film , I suddenly remembered that I was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave ( and I ca n't recall the last film I walked out of ) . I 'm guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point I could n't care . If you 'd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then I 'd recommend anything by the above two directors , for example " In the Mood for Love " or " Flowers of Shanghai " , both of which were filmed by the talented Mr Ping ( the former with Chris Doyle ) , and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . It 's not often Mr Hoberman leads me astray , and perhaps you 'd rather listen to him , but do n't say you were n't warned . Craig.<br /><br / >
0 " Dominique " is one of those films that the expression " slow - as - molasses " must have been invented for . Too many endless and repetitive sequences ( how many times do we see Robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano ? ) . It is ALMOST redeemed at the end by a surprising twist , which , unfortunately , is followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a bad taste in our mouths . Not a very enjoyable film .
0 Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie - worthy performance here if there ever was one ; it 's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling " dial it down ; think zombie , only less lively " through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson 's effort . The rest of the cast is barely better ; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN 'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role . If the quality of the acting was three times better ; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled ; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline , then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd . As is , its rating is so inexplicably high one ca n't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to catch a little snoozing time . Perhaps the late - night TV telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such .
0 To call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of GASLIGHT ( 1939 & 1944 ) via LES DIABOLIQUES ( 1954 ) ; while still watchable in itself , it 's so cliché - ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . However , thanks to the dire straits in which the British film industry found itself in the late 1970s , even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - Cliff Robertson ( as the conniving husband ) , Jean Simmons ( in the title role ) , Jenny Agutter ( as Robertson 's artist half - sister ) , Simon Ward ( as the enigmatic chauffeur ) , Ron Moody ( as an ill - fated doctor ) , Michael Jayston ( as Robertson 's business partner ) , Judy Geeson ( as Simmons ' best friend and Jayston 's wife ) , Flora Robson ( as the housekeeper ) , David Tomlinson ( as the notary reading Simmons ' will ) and , most surprisingly perhaps , Jack Warner ( as a gravestone sculptor ) - although most of them actually have nothing parts , I 'm sorry to say !
0 The character acting is a little stiff , as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen . Unfortunately one of the better actresses , Jean Simmons ( played many bit roles on TV , like in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night ) , dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed.<br /><br />The lead role is Mr Ballard , as portrayed by Cliff Robertson . Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time . He does n't do a poor job , but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and also NOT acting . Robertson 's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies ( starring Tobey Maguire).<br /><br />The plot is predictable . A husband murders his rich wife for her money . thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window ( fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him ) on the day he is predicted to die no less.<br /><br />The second chauffeur Mr Ballard hires looks a lot like an English mark Hamill . Uncanny really ! The only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue . Many minutes pass in quietness , no one speaks , and few act . It is a shame the MST3 K guys never got hold of this movie . It could have been much better , if not just as predictable , with more dialogue , or shorter scenes of ' nothingness'.<br /><br />I kept expecting G'Mork 's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the " nothing " that inhabits this film .
0 This movie was o.k . but it could have been much better . There are some spooky moments but there are n't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again . There are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything . The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable , & that is the reason why I rated it so low . It 's watchable but do n't expect anything great .
0 I think Cliff Robertson certainly was one of our finest actors . He has a half dozen classics to his credit . He does fine here as the heavy , but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome , it never gets off the mark . The story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself . Still he mugs well and carries things along . The death knell is twofold . First of all , if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another , it would eat up about a third of the movie . Add to that , Robertson 's character sitting up in bed in the blue light , looking confused , that might add another chunk . I agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent , though insignificant film . The biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that , when all is said and done , leaves incredible questions . I 'm not putting in spoilers , but when it ends , do n't think too much . I can come up with ten what - ifs without raising a sweat . It would have been better if it had remained a ghost story .
0 Judy Holliday struck gold in 1950 withe George Cukor 's film version of " Born Yesterday , " and from that point forward , her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again.<br /><br />It never happened . In " It Should Happen to You " ( I ca n't think of a blander title , by the way ) , Holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who 's maybe not so dumb after all , but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted . Even Jack Lemmon , in what I believe was his first film role , ca n't muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy . The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning , so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up.<br /><br />Maybe if you 're enamored of Holliday you 'll enjoy this ; otherwise I would n't bother.<br /><br />Grade : C
0 ' Major Payne ' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines . This film does not really have a lot to offer , but it provides several hilarious moments that are well - worth a watch . Do n't expect it to be a memorable film , however . Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious , and that 's really all I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne . Again , it is not a great film , and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .
0 Sort of family parody blending " An Officer And A Gentleman " , " Heartbreak Ridge " , " Full Metal Jacket " ( and without doubt other movies I am not able to remember now ) into a rather dull movie , with some bright spots . The gags are always there where you would expect them , and Damon Wayans 's lines are , well , predictable . As I said , unfortunately this movie never surprises you ...
0 If this is someone 's " favorite " movie , they need some serious help . There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest . I have n't seen the original movie this is the remake of ( some 1950s film ) , but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization.<br /><br />A major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element , and winds up teaching children at an ROTC school . Unfortunately , the major is Daman Wayans ... so the children are in for a world of annoying , humorless asininity . Can Wayans whip these losers into shape ? Can they get him to become a little more human ? The film bombs as most Wayans films do , with only a few sparkling moments . William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time , fair too little . This charming old man ( known best to me as a " Tales from the Crypt " actor , known best to you as Uncle Louis from " Christmas Vacation " ) shines every moment he 's on screen , which is n't much here.<br /><br />Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker , which fits him perfectly . I would n't mind slightly more Bam Bam , but I think he carried the role of " biker " about as far as it could be carried for a military film.<br /><br />And then there 's the attractive teacher , who someone falls for Major Payne even though he treats the kids poorly , has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with . She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate . I 'm not sure which ( though it would seem " stupid " since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough).<br /><br />Wayans had one shining moment : a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves ( including a very nice " robot " ) , and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew . This scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle.<br /><br />Seriously , avoid this film . If you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes , rent or buy " Ernest Goes to Camp " . At least he 's a lovable loser , and actually funny . Maybe if Major Payne had fought a badger I 'd feel better , but he did n't . Forget Payne , forget Wayans ... you can do so much better .
0 but there are not too many of them . Probably the worst " major release " film I have seen in my life . Definitely the worst for this year . There is no point in commenting on the plot , the cast or the acting . The problem is beyond all that . It lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind ( not the funny kind ) of everything that takes place on the screen . I do n't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10 . Probably , because of Steven Martini . He really did try . Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells . Avoid at any cost .
0 Did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here ? Now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? Wrong . This is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments .It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found Damon Wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . Does he speak like that in real life ? If he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies
0 Major Payne was really not very good at all . Despite being funny here and there , the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor . Major Payne 's voice and temperament were especially annoying . The idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous . I would not recommend this film to anyone .
0 I view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and I can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst I have seen this year ( If not ever , however I have not actually seen " Quest of the Delta Knights " yet ) . This movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because I had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip I could n't walk out.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle . The four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer .
0 Stefan is an x - con that five years ago got married to Marie . Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he 's offered to do a courier job . Stefan 's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli , a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner . Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery . Due to the fact that Elli 's father during the war fleed to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden . To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father , no matter what it takes . Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of .. <br /><br />This movie does n't seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it 's been americanized alot . Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist makes it all average , the effects makes the movie a little too much though . See it and jugde for yourself.<br /><br / >
0 With the releasing of " Farligt förflutet " Swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom . Stefan ( Jens Hultén ) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife Marie ( Regina Lund ) . One day an old friend of Stefan´s arrives with a favor to ask him . Stefan is to do a small courier job . He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the Sweden - Germany customs . Unfortunately things in Germany don´t work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble . It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family - drama pattern . Unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written , filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic . The content can be concluded with : bad acting , an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs . The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex - scene wit the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund . This lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure , let´s say what it truly is , crap .
0 Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The acting , the dialog , the manuscript , the sound , the lighting , the plot line . I actually ca n't say anything positive about this , although I enjoy Swedish movies . The fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it 's impossible to take it seriously . And when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt , while dodging bullets in a strip bar , I 'm not sure if it 's supposed to be a joke , or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film ? ! Regina Lund is the only half descent actor , but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions . It leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this ...
0 This film , by Oscar Petersson , is unique . Its uniqueness does n't lie in the story , since many a half brained Hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots , but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects.<br /><br />The dialog is worse than embarrassing . Rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix . Bosnians speaking English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor . Uninspired lightning and camera - work are icing on the turkey film cake . As a sort of surprise for the audience , there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you 'd least expect any . To add insult to injury , the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing.<br /><br />The " bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy 's speech " scene in the church , is the point at which is time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position as the worst director of all times ; Move over Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson !
0 In theory , ' Director 's Commentary ' should have worked . The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane , a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera . Amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are ' Bonanza ' , ' Flambards ' , ' The Duchess Of Duke Street ' , and ' The Bounder ' . His commentaries are not the least bit informative , due to his habit of wandering off the point.<br /><br />But in practice , it failed dismally . It is a one - joke show , and the joke is not particularly funny . The scripts are completely lacking in wit , and Bryden fails to convince as an old man . Whenever stuck for anything amusing to say , which is like every five seconds , he issues a hissing laugh . Rather than being amused by DeLane , you want to shoot him . If senile old men strike you as hilarious , then this is for you.<br /><br />It did n't help that the shows mocked were , with the exceptions of ' Mr & Mrs ' and ' Crossroads ' , rather good . For the joke to work , they needed to be really dreadful such as ' Charlie 's Angels ' , ' O.T.T. ' , ' Telly Addicts ' , ' Neighbours ' , and ' New Faces'.<br /><br />The show tanked big time , so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions . Would n't it be deliciously ironic if ' Director 's Commentary ' were someday itself the subject of a spoof ?
0 The Howling II starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by Christopher Lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field , oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason . He says " for it 's written the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood . And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication 's and upon her forehead was written , behold I am the great Mother of # an inaudible word I could n't make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to , sorry # and all abominations of the Earth " . This opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre . After the opening credits which are set over shots of Transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we 're in ' Los Angeles , California U.S.A. City of the Angels ' . I knew I was in for a long 86 minutes . It 's probably not too long after the events of the original Howling ( 1981 ) and it 's Karen White 's funeral . After the ceremony Karen 's brother Ben ( Reb Brown ) is spoken to by an ' occult investigator ' called Stefan Crosscoe ( Christopher Lee ) who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life . Ben dismisses such nonsense . But together with one of Karen 's friends and colleagues Jenny ( Annie McEnroe ) he visits Stefan at his home . There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed , he mentions Stirba ( Sybil Danning ) who is the queen of Werewolves . Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karen 's funeral of a woman named Mariana ( Marsha A. Hunt ) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen . Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium . Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister 's crypt is to stop Stefan . However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan , Ben and Jenny . They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania . They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse . Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means ' where wolves live ' and meet up with the local priest , Father Florin ( Ladislav Krecmer ) and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters , hey what else can I call them ? Oh , and a dwarf named Florica ( Ludmila Safarova ) helps too . They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba . But Stirba knows of Stefan 's arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny . Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirba 's plans for world domination ? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal ? Watch it and find out . Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film . It 's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently . The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and does n't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like . Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring , unlike the original . Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained . Most people will probably hate it , but for those of us who enjoy ' bad ' films this is right up there with the best of them . There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch . We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry . The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I do n't know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it does n't look like what I thought mid 80 's Transylvania would . Stirba 's castle is part dungeon , part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house . Stirba and her servant 's costumes are very over - the - top , Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a S / M video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy , and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too . The special make - up effects range from good to poor , a dwarf 's eyes explode , someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this is n't a film loaded with gore , although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks . There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves ! I should also mention the music , the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down . Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film ? ! I wonder what he thinks of it . Basically the whole thing is a real mess , but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same . Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end . Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage , it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times ! If that 's your thing .
0 After watching this , I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee ( This has passed over time ) . This film was utter garbage . First , they tried to recreate the ending from the first " Howling , " with incredibly bad make - up . Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film ! The plot sucks and the whole film is just AWFUL ! ! ! ! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film ( From the look of it , it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone)teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves , lead by Sybil Danning , who seems to be naked all the time.<br /><br />This is not even worth renting ( Unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity . ) . Try to catch it on cable instead . It would be so chopped up , it may actually make sense .
0 Howling II ( 1985 ) was a complete 180 from the first film . Whilst the first film was campy and creepy . The second one was sleazy and cheesy . The production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious . The brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis ' . The " scene " from the first film was badly re - created . A skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro ' ( Reb Brown ) to the old country ( Romania ) to uncover the mystery to her sister 's murder / transformation / death . Christopher Lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage / guide to the two . Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba , the head werewolf of the Romania . She also suffers from a bad case of morning face , ewww!<br /><br />Bad movie . There 's nothing good about this stinker . I 'm surprise Philippe Mora directed this picture because he 's usually a good film - maker . The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it ( no , not the content but the film stock itself ) . To round the movie off you get a lousy " punk " performance from a Damned wannabe " Babel " . Maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could 've got the real deal instead of an imitation.<br /><br />Best to avoid unless you 're desperate or you lost the remote and you 're too lazy to change the channel .
0 From the moment Christopher Lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club , you know you 've got a stinker on your hands ! This film had potential . Beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film , if not an interesting one . The final product is a real mess , however . Aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women , Howling II winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film . Christopher Lee gives it a nugget of credibility , but even he can not raise it above the level of crap.<br /><br />Having never seen any of the other films in this series , this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one . We start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original , and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves . The film is paced fairly well , and there are not too many dead spots . The action is there ; it just is n't filmed well . One bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel . Though their song is played quite often , it is rather catchy.<br /><br />The problems with this film are great in number . First off , the acting is worse than pitiful . Christopher Lee is good enough , but that 's where it ends . The two leads Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are lacking in just about everything you 'd want for such characters . The writing is wretched , the editing redundant , and the direction amateurish . There are a couple nice special effect gimmicks , but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number . Sybil Danning is nice to look at , but her acting performance is less than satisfactory . Judd Omen looks the part he plays , but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least . Much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be Latin.<br /><br />I liked the general idea for the story . I always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil . One scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting . Kind of . Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling . 3 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.<br /><br />Side note : As of this writing , the censors at youtube.com have still not taken down the ending credits with Sybil Danning ripping off her top several times while the Babel song is playing ! Catch it while you can !
0 Dreadful horror sequel to " The Howling " . This picks off with Karen White 's funeral ( she was killed at the end of the first film ) . Stefan Crosscoe ( Christopher Lee sadly ) arrives there and tells Karen 's brother Ben ( Reb Brown ) that Karen was a werewolf . He 's going to Transylvania to kill Striba ( Sybil Danning ) the head werewolf . Ben and a coworker of Karens ( Annie McEnroe ) join him.<br /><br />A terrible script , bad direction , inept editing and truly horrendous acting by Brown and McEnroe single handedly sink this one . The werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark -- for good reason ! They 're terrible when you see them . Subpar special effects also -- although I DID like the cartoon lightning that comes from Danning 's fingers . There 's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and Danning takes off her top at least EIGHT TIMES during the closing credits ! < br /><br />There are a few good things -- I found the village in Transylvania amusing -- it looks like it came from a Universal horror flick from the 1930s ! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes ; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good in this -- but they ca n't save it . Really -- WHY did they do this ? Where that they hard up for money ? ? ? This is one of IMDb 's lowest rated movies . That alone should tell you something . Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie -- I can understand why ! A must - miss .
0 OK , as everyone has pointed out , this film is a complete dog . To some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised ( or darkened down to near invisibility ) to escape the censor 's X - rating ; but the film has many other flaws as well.<br /><br />To begin with , the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up . The baddies in this film are furry and do n't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires . Now you just ca n't do that with a crappy genre flick , you 've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing . In fact the whole ( confusing and poorly presented ) plot is something that has already been done for vampires , but does n't make any sense in a werewolf movie.<br /><br />Secondly , the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen . Anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically , yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy.<br /><br />There are a couple of slightly good bits . I actually quite liked the score . Others have mentioned Sybil Danning 's tits . And ... <br /><br />(***SPOILER * * * , if such a thing can exist)<br /><br />I also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves ' stronghold . There are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly , but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti - werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters . I mean , you can kill werewolves with silver bullets , and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days . Should n't be too hard to put two and two together , hmm ? But in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti - lycanthrope weapons .
0 Ugly shot , poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to Joe Dante 's 1981 classic . " The Howling " is one of the two or three ONLY good werewolf - films ever made and yet it got ' rewarded ' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one . If it 's any consolation , " Stirba " is a sequel in name only and there 's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in Dante 's film . The plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of Transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by Stirba . Stirba is played by Sybil Danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super - babe ( with impressive bosom ) in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused . Her arch - enemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee . His character  Stefan Crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to Stirba 's kingdom , accompanied by an American couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult . In case you 're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity ... this is your film . Even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we 're even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence . However , if you want a little substance or depth , you 'll be sorely disappointed . The dialogues are embarrassing and there 's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere . The scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires ( the Transsylvanian setting , garlic , wooden stakes ... ) and Danning 's gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film 's only gimmick . During the end - credits , a shot in which she rips off her top , is re - edited repeatedly ( according to my fellow reviewer Dr. Gore , no less than seventeen times ! ) which is pretty pathetic and pointless . The music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful . I 'm talking about the fierce - looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of Stirba 's castle . The directing by Philippe Mora is a giant mess and  as far as I 'm concerned  his only worthwhile film remains " The Beast Within " , released three years earlier .
0 Ben a out - of - town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice , but he 's approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult . So Ben , his sister 's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put a end to this evil.<br /><br />This is incredibly awful B - grade stuff and I wondered how it even got released . It makes the original ' Howling ' look like a masterpiece . What was Christopher Lee thinking , as this has to be his worst performance I 've seen.<br /><br />There was a lot wrong with this real cheap - ass film , ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from Annie McEnroe , Reb Brown , Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning ( not to forgot Lee ) , cheesy fashion ( those sunnies ) , cheap and lame special effects , bad use of lighting , the humour ... if there was any , trashy 80s music ( with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing ) , werewolf 's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue . I thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny , but I was wrong . < br /><br />The positives were the location and settings of the film looked great , but that 's about it ... actually I 'll add Sybil Danning short stripping scene too.<br /><br />During the end credits the band plays their crap - house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film , which I beckon the question why?<br /><br />An awful piece of mess , however at least it is n't boring.<br /><br />1/5
0 This film is really bad , so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save it . A poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film , the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again . This garbage make Plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material .
0 Lee hosted the 100 Years of Horror for Ted Newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves . He said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was The Howling II , then he quipped , " The less said about that the better . " Indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances . The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter . It was a film to be taken seriously . Like other good original films , filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(See CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point ) . This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front . There is absolutely nothing scary about it . It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes . Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay , I 'll cede Ferdy Mayne too ) . Lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and Stirba ) . Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave America to go to Romania . The story is n't really worth examining here , and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise . Sybil Danning is here and , yes , she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(I counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point ) . I gave the film three stars , but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning 's contributions . Yuck !
0 Yes , the first " Howling " was a classic . A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly , but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera . Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure ... well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film . Oh sure , they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did , but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something . I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie , however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before , but still read the script before you take a role . Maybe you could have gotten into " An American Werewolf in London " hell that could have been possible . It was set in London after all . Heck , werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene . In fact , the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude 's ear 's started bleeding .
0 We had STARZ free weekend and I switched on the station to see what was on . It was this movie Howling II : The acting was terrible but the eye candy was great . Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the afore mentioned eye candy . I was laughing a lot from the few scenes I saw.<br /><br />My friends wonder why I never want to go to Horror movies , If they saw this film they would know why . I would get thrown out for laughing so hard.<br /><br />Just a couple of trivia notes : Reb Brown who played Ben White had played Captain American in a made for TV movie Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers inspiration for the song " Brown Sugar " Mick has great taste in women for sure .
0 In the first Howling , we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized . The plot in that film made some sense ; a TV reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth . She ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one . Then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live TV . The special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they do n't get any better in this one . Whether it 's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers.<br /><br />The plot line is n't all that bad ; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason . This wo n't destroy all werewolves and it really does n't end the threat from werewolves as it ... they just want to kill her . I think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film.<br /><br />After the film " ends " we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some Devo - esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves . < br /><br />The only thing that makes this movie even watchable is Christopher Lee .
0 to be honest , i did n't watch all of the original ' howling ' , but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie . so great , that seven horrible sequels had to be made . they started off with " Howling II : Your Sister Is A Werewolf " . i got this movie on VHS from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new . i just watched it last night , and it was n't really BAD , it was just weird . i mean , the whole thing with Sybil Danning going three - way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing ( but kinda hot ) , Christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she 's a vampire , etc . actually , this movie was actually like some sort of mish - mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with werewolves , because everything Christopher Lee ( whom played Dracula himself ) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie ( stake in the heart , garlic , the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT , and the ruler of werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA ) . not much for the acting , but the worst of it came from Annie McEnroe . i swear , at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out , because that damn throat always had to say SOMETHING . Anyway , the plot is pretty silly and clichéd , so there 's no real point in telling you , you could just read about it on Wikipedia . By the way , the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it 's the ONLY film out of all the seven sequels that s related in any way to the original ( not counting Howling IV ( 1988 ) , which was a remake of the original , or in other words , a sequel based on the same novel ) . so do n't see this movie . there 's no real horror , hardly any werewolves , and just horrible special fx . 3/10
0 I have always been somewhat underwhelmed by Joe Dante 's original THE HOWLING ( 1981 )  so I was n't particularly interested in checking out any of its sequels ; some time ago , I did catch HOWLING III : THE MARSUPIALS ( 1987 )  by the same director as this one  and found it to be watchable but nothing special.<br /><br />The second instalment , however , has quite a bad rep and I knew I 'd have a good time watching it  if mainly to wallow in the sight of dear but pompous horror icon Christopher Lee squirming in the midst of it all ( the gracefully - aged star has pathetically asserted a number of times in interviews that he has n't appeared in horror - oriented fare since his last picture for Hammer Films back in 1976 ! ) . Anyway , this film should have borne the subtitle " Your Movie Is A Turd "  being astoundingly inept in all departments ( beginning with the all - important werewolf make - up ) ! < br /><br />The plot ( and dialogue ) is not only terrible , but it has the limpest connection with Dante 's film  strangely enough , the author of the original novel Gary Brandner co - wrote this himself ! Still , one of the undeniable highlights ( er ... low points ) of the film is the pointless elliptical editing  which tries to give the whole a semblance of style , but only serves to accentuate its embarrassment factor ! Similarly phoney ( and grating ) are the hokey transitions between scenes , the inane punk - rock theme song , and the cheapjack special - effects at the climax ! < br /><br />What about the characters , then ? : Lee is the werewolf expert , naturally , whom everybody thinks a crackpot  until they come into contact with the monsters , that is ; at the very least , though , one has to admire the makers ' ingenuity ( or gall ) in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning ! Incidentally , Sybil Danning ( as Stirba , Werewolf Bitch  the subtitle by which this is known in the U.K. ! ) is quite fetching in an assortment of outrageous S&M outfits ... but her character is virtually given nothing to do ( except preside over her brood of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious three - way lycanthrope sex ! ) ; her two snarling lieutenants ( one of them a sluttish black girl ) are especially irritating.<br /><br />Aiding Lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes ( he being the brother of the Dee Wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers ) and a ragged guerrilla - type band of Transylvians ( still , they generally manage to effortlessly overcome Danning 's rather dumb werewolves ! ) . Notable among them is a knife - throwing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty ( but , at the same time , side - splitting ) demise ; he 's later revived , under Stirba 's control , in order to lure Lee ( by making childish taunts at him all through the village streets ) into a trap . The latter scene has to be a career nadir for the distinguished and imposing actor  well , either this or the early sequence in a discotheque where Lee is made to don a pair of ultra - cool sunglasses so as to appear inconspicuous among the partying youngsters!<br /><br />In the end , if I were forced to mention elements in this which were n't entirely displeasing , I guess I could say that the ossuary set ( in which the heroine is to be sacrificed ) is interesting , or that the hybrid werewolf / bat creature ( Danning 's pet who likes to ' inhabit ' the body of its victims ) is just too weird to be despised ...
0 Now this film is n't going to scare anyone , but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reason and a smaller one- well , that 's three reasons , is n't it.<br /><br />The first reason this is interesting is the special effects . I found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular . To see the hair growing on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was creepy , especially when they were participating in a ménage à trois.<br /><br />Of interest , is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous " Brown Sugar " of the Rolling Stones song , and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the London cast of the rock musical Hair.<br /><br />Besides the special effects , there were two other points of note in this film , and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits . I lost count , but i swear that Sybil Danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more . Theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film .
0 This is a pretty bad movie . But not so bad as it 's reputation suggests . The production values are n't too bad and there is the odd effective scene . And it does have an 80 's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun . Watch out , too , for Jimmy Nail 's brief appearance - his attempt at an American accent is so astoundingly rubbish it 's fantastic . Fantastic too are Sybil Danning 's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12 " remix of Sybil Danning 's boobs . Has to be seen to be believed . As a horror movie it is n't scary , the effects are silly and Christopher Lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance . I guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit . The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that I have forgotten almost everything about them and I just watched this movie earlier tonight . The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie , in fact , bizarrely , they sometimes look more like badly burned apes . The eastern European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel , while being pretty terrible , does at least give the film some added cheese.<br /><br />Overall ? Good for a laugh . Not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be ? And , at the very least , you 've always got Sybil 's knockers .
0 Somewhere , buried very deep inside this film is a half - way decent movie trying to get out . The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles ( in a bar and a graveyard ) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design . Like I say , buried very deep . One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations . Annie Mcenroe 's reaction to being told that her sister ( presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie ) is ( was ? ) a werewolf is , if I recall , along the lines of ; " Oh ! Really ? " . Not one of the better responses to said challenge . The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba the ( apparently self - appointed ) " Queen of the Werewolves " . As Stirba , Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie . Yes , even better than the werewolf group - sex scene , Reb Brown 's acting , and the oddly simian - looking werewolf suits . The end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory ( at least until the censor finds them ) on Youtube . Check them out to see why and remember , the whole film makes about the same amount of sense . If you happen to catch this on US television the credits have been re - edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath . It 's a sort of absurdity , cherry - on - top moment which defies satire .
0 This U.S soap opera , ' Knots Landing ' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator . Every episode contained plots such as rape , murder , kidnapping and drug smuggling , not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period . As for the cast , I 've seen better actors on a cereal box . From the mid to late ' 90 's , repeats of ' Knots ' stunk up U.K - Gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies . I regret to announce that I had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously . Though since then , re - runs have been few and far between ( let 's hope it stays that way ) . The only positive thing that can be said of ' Knots ' is the catchy saxophone signature tune , later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom , ' The Upper Hand ' . Great legacy that , eh ?
0 In the Tower of Babel installment of the mini - series , the narrator describes the builders of the tower as " the descendants of Moses." < br /><br />That 's like saying George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great.<br /><br />Or that the light bulb was invented before the wheel.<br /><br />Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow - and - arrow.<br /><br />Need I say more?<br /><br />The writers of The Greatest Heroes of the Bible should have at least paid closer attention to the chronologies of Biblical people and events .
0 I watched this knowing almost nothing about it , other than the brief description I read here . After watching it I was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish , then I looked at the other stuff he 's done to see if this was his first or second movie , but no , he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com . He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one.<br /><br />The story was pretty awful too , could someone just fall in love with a girl because she 's pretty but has the mind of a child ? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible .
0 I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb , even convincing my wife that it was a " unique horror movie . " I wanted to like this movie , but was unable to.<br /><br />The " love story " was good , but the horror aspect was quite bad . If the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia , then it would have been a better movie.<br /><br />The care centre stretched credulity well past the limits , in fact it was quite ridiculous . The doctor happily ignors privacy laws and professionalism . A nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient ( without security escort ) , and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason . The forensic patient ( and the film 's villain ) is tied up in a standing position fully clothed - apparently for years ? None of it makes much sense.<br /><br />The movie even had some actors that I 've liked in other things , such as the detectives , but still I ca n't recommend this movie .
0 This film is very creepy indeed . Unfortunately , not for the reasons the film makers would hope.<br /><br />There 's a mastermind serial killer too , but he 's not what 's creepy either . He 's just your standard comic book villain , a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger , though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either . Incidentally , for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals , can they be detained chained in a stress position , on their feet , arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out ? I suppose in the world that gave us Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay , anything 's possible.<br /><br />No , what 's really creepy about this film is the central character , Danny . This unappealing young man , aided and abetted it 's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality , wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman , and on the basis of nothing whatsoever ( her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent ) imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her.<br /><br />Seemingly within days , he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her , believing ( completely falsely , as we discover ) that he is better able to care for her than anyone else , and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment , is sexually molesting her though she is ( again due to her sleepiness ) entirely unable to consent or resist.<br /><br />Our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed . He is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships , let alone sexual relationships , so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman , who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years . The scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe - making , and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he 'll have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror . But again , I 'm afraid , not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for , but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion . We can all see clearly what 's on the end of our forks here - it 's the paedophile 's perfect dream of innocence , sexual compliance and utter dependence . Horrible , horrible , horrible.<br /><br />What else have we got in this mish mash ? Twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del Toro . The compulsory " You need to go to the police " argument , where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it 's the only sensible course of action . The automaton sequence , much praised in the comments here , though completely and utterly pointless ( " It serves no function ! " , as Sigourney Weaver memorably protested in Galaxy Quest ) and looking to me just like the Abominable Doctor Phibes rehashed in one of the Saw derivatives.<br /><br />Jeffrey Combs does his best though , so a star for that , and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this , and in general this is well - shot and competently performed .
0 It 's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on IMDb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire IMDb career and yes you 've guessed it , that film is " Parasomnia " . I 've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case.<br /><br />That 's not to say Parasomnia is terrible , but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be.<br /><br />On the plus side , it has a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil , I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with Hannibal Lecter . There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences , in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better . The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.<br /><br />Although I understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story , it 's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that . If you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly , then the story is losing you and that 's what kept happening to me with this film . Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I do n't want to get into spoiler territory , but I will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing , not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life.<br /><br />All in all , there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism , but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special .
0 Parasomnia has an interesting premises , but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach . The cast in unconvincing , even Patrick Kilpatrick , who played great roles in movies like Scanner Cop 2 , Open Fire , Under Siege 2 and Eraser . The rest of the cast is unknown ( and not very good ) with the exception of Jeffrey Combs . ( Herbert West from the great Re - Animator trilogy ) . But he can play roles like this in his sleep ( which is a little what he does here ) . The main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all . The story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes , especially at the end.<br /><br />This could have been so much better , I do not get the good reviews on this one . It is below average really .
0 Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea . That is the problem is n't ? The concept is fresh and full of potential , but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance . It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters . This movie does n't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight , and here is why . First you do n't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to , I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here , it 's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . They are not believable in the way they act and interact . Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum , frowning and looking intense all the time is n't the way to go here . I mean what is that ? , he looks like he 's on the toilet or something . I loved him in re - animator and the way he was playing the intense / neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money . But not for this , he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner , it 's not natural , I 'm surprised he did n't dislocate his jaw during filming . The movie is basically on life support , it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come .
0 Nice attempt and good ideas ( redemption of the prostitute , human beings helping each other out , ... ) but a poor result ... The director obviously tried to emulate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray Viet Nam ... The only problem is that this Viet Nam is long gone and when " The scent of the green papaya " had a historical background ... trying to project this kind of ambiance ( muffled sounds and the slow pace of life ... ) on modern days leaves a feeling of fake . Besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious.<br /><br />I can only suppose the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because that is where Harvey Keitel , ex - marine in the movie , was probably stationed during the war ... But in Southern Viet Nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip Northern accent displayed by the actors ... Seriously odd even for a bad Vietnamese speaker.<br /><br />An old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful ( not a disease for people of his condition ) , a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate Vietnamese poetry , ... even more doubtful ... < br /><br / >
0 There are similarities between Ray Lawrence 's " Jindabyne " and his last movie " Lantana "  a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives . But whereas " Lantana " offered some hope and resolution , " Jindabyne " leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied , perhaps even cheated.<br /><br />The storyline - the aftermath of a fisherman 's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver . It became an element in Robert Altman 's classic 1993 ensemble " Short Cuts " . Lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small Australian community under stress . The movie poses some moral questions " Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend ? " and more poignantly for Australians " Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal ? " The acting , especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney , is commendable . And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music , not unlike " Picnic at Hanging Rock".<br /><br />If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a let down , the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning , thereby eliminating the element of mystery . And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale .
0 This film is terrible . I was really looking forward to it , as I thought " Lantana " was great.<br /><br />The following review may contain * spoilers*<br /><br />*****<br /><br />First , the good things : it looks great , some of the performances are OK . The bad things are everything else about it . < br /><br />The story , as you possibly know , is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body , with the twist that they find it on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they get back into mobile ( cell phone ) range . However the film takes it 's time ( boy does it take its time ) getting to this central event.<br /><br />Of the ensemble of characters ( about a dozen ) , not one seems to like another one ( which is , I suppose , consistent , because they are all unlikable ) . I was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related , and it was not until near the end of the movie that I could vaguely construct the family tree . < br /><br />It 's hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim , which is a failure in the structure of the story , as the character 's lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after . Once you 've set the bar so high , it 's hard to up - it short of everyone committing suicide.<br /><br />There are silly lapses in logic . The killer dumps the body in the lake , and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains . The fishermen walk out Sunday morning , but for some reason Byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed . Then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station . Um , they have n't heard of the telephone ? Down at the station , the media know the whole story , less than 24 hours after they reported the body?<br /><br />Totally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body . This is a mystery - everyone asks them " how could you do that ? " and the audience is asking the same question . ( The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in " Deliverance " ) . I know exactly what I 'd do in their situation . Someone needs to walk out to the car , drive to mobile range , call the cops , wait , and them guide them back to the location . If the others wait at camp and fish , who cares?<br /><br />A lot of all this just seems false . The only thing that rung true was that , as the girl was black , the local aboriginals seized on the fishermen 's actions as racist - " would n't have done it if it was a white girl . " < br /><br />Throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl ( I think the subject is mentioned once ) , and there is no mystery , as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene.<br /><br />So I 'm sitting there simultaneously bored and confused , when there 's a twist - not in the plot , but the theme . Suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about black - white reconciliation . Huh?<br /><br />This is Australian film " at its finest " , according to The Age .
0 This is n't art , it 's inner - urban , politically - correct propaganda ! Jindabyne 's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable ... it does n't see people as individuals , but rather , as members of categories.<br /><br />This is the most patronisingly offensive Australian movie I can recall ever ( and it 's up against some pretty stiff competition ! ) . A message movie , every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there : Aborigines are victims ; white men are violent or alcoholics ; white women are n't that bad -particularly if they are lesbians - but they 're most likely of a depressive nature.<br /><br />Four men who go away fishing , find the body of a murdered woman ( Aboriginal , naturally ) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout . It 's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion , as if the men are animals . The one man who briefly demurs is the goodie ... we know this because he 's living with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his baby a lot - and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location ( away from all these beastly bush - dwellers).<br /><br />This is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within . It 's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt . The film is shot through with long - distance views of the bush backed by foreboding , mysterious music . It 's made very clear by the end that Aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape . It concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black - white reconciliation.<br /><br />In Jindabyne , country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other Australians.<br /><br />This film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the Government 's Film Finance Corporation . It 's a product of the artsy set , that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects ( which are as detached from real life as possible ) , as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see . It does n't matter if the film is a stinker , they still get paid.<br /><br />Spare yourself from wasting time , avoid it like the plague . More jaded social commentary than actual entertainment , this film deserves to pan !
0 Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever ! ? ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright ... from the annoying characters in this movie . From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy , to the killer just running about without any notice ( and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?) .. things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film . As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction , then just does n't go anywhere , but into a new direction ... and on and on ... <br /><br />The acting is great , but the writing is horrible . Each character , in each scene , says or does something so unbelievable , unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast / extras are simply strange . There are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film , making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time .
0 there was some truth to this movie . I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished . I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse ( or some such charge ) . I 'm not sure if it was in Australia . The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders . Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception . The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan . But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever , as someone claimed , I ca n't be that generous . Put it this way , I would n't bother watching it again .
0 With no fault to the actors ( they all put on great performances ) , the overall story was not very well executed . The movie opens with a great zinger : a crazy old guy forces a young Aborigine girl 's car off the road . But then , we 're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters ... and we do n't know why until the 40 minutes are up . It turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl 's body ... and the story progresses from there.<br /><br />While the story does pick up at that point , it really goes nowhere . After 2 hours , I asked myself : was there a point to this , or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery ? The story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished . While it is well acted , there 's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it .
0 I had a really hard time making it through this move . It was extermly slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life.<br /><br />This movie seemed to flow to slow and I kept on wondering when it was going to end . I am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what I was looking for.<br /><br />It seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie . At one point it seemed to turn political which I am not a big fan of in movies . If you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you . As for me I felt I wasted 2 hours when I could of been doing something else .
0 Canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets . The premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when Druids were the spiritual leaders . Working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry . Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross - dressing and assorted farcical situations arise . The film could have been hilarious as a Monty Python piece , which it too closely resembles , but Rohmer 's effort falls very flat . The audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace . The ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful . This is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time .
0 I was aware of Rohmer 's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts , and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures ( as Renoir 's or Chaplin 's very last movies ; yes , the " politique des auteurs " also has its dark side ) . But with " Les amours d'Astrée et de Céladon " , it 's as if Rohmer himself wanted , for what may be his last movie , to perpetuate this tradition of great directors , who made a last senile movie , by adapting Urfé 's " L'astrée " , with ridiculous aesthetic codes , witch just look like a parody of Rosselini 's last movies ( the ones he made for TV from Descartes or Marx 's lives).<br /><br />In his version of " Perceval " , Rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re - transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things . The director apparently changed his mind when the XVII century is involved , and films actors , dressed like 1600 's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes . But the all thing looks even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees . It 's not that the story itself is stupid , but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny ( and I 'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors , the annoying and sad humorist tries by Rodolphe Pauly , the ridiculous soft - erotic tone , the poor musical tentatives , or the strange fascination for trasvestisment!).<br /><br />The radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke , which mixes a soft - erotic movie made for TV with theological scholastic discussions ( sic ! ) . At the beginning of the movie , Rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity , and that 's why he had to film " L'Astrée " in other parts of the country . However , I 'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting , if Rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions . This film may interest a few historians , but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad Rohmer 's movie .
0 One of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Acting was terrible , both for the kids and the adults . Most to all characters showed no , little or not enough emotion . The lighting was terrible , and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot ( In the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed , there 's 4 shots ; The sheriff and Dad in the evening on their boat , Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming , the rest of the kids in the daytime * when it 's supposed to in the evening * at the river bank , and the doctor , Beatrice , and Simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat . ) The best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff , Cappy ( Although , there 's a slip of character when the pulse detector * Whatever that thing is when people die , it beeps * shows Cappy has died , he still moves while it can still be heard beeping , and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually , then it shows the pulse again , and THEN he finally dies . ) I guess it 's not going to be perfect , since it 's an independent movie , but it still could be better . Not worth watching , honestly , even for kids . Might as well watch something good , like The Lion King or Toy Story if you 're going to see anything you 'll remember .
0 This was the WORST movie I have ever seen ! Molly ( molly hall ) could not act AT ALL ! she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book . The smart kid and the kid who loves food ( there names were n't worth remembering ) were so annoying it drove me crazy . When ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food . Mollys Dad did n't show enough emotion about his daughter missing . The police officer and Mollys dad said the same thing like four times . it was just horrible . Everything was repeated way to much . Beatrice should have had something bad happen to her for being so mean . I just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie !
0 It was so terrible . It was n't fun to watch at all . Even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator , even that 's not fun to watch in this movie . I say again , the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch . Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched , just girl on couch using a vibrator . Maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters , maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level . My advice , fast forward to that point , watch it , rewind the movie , watch it again , rewind , repeat . Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way . This movie ranks alongside I spit on your grave and Doom generation in the category of worst movies that I have ever seen .
0 This is the worst movie I have ever seen . I was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it . Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face for taking this role . I was physically ill after watching this film . I really do n't understand Hollywood sometimes . There are so many people trying to break in that I 'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best . That way the worst movie you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge . The gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film . Glad I avoided this film and watched it on TV . This proves that you should avoid January releases at all cost .
0 There 's a lot of movies that have set release dates , only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind , and then put in limbo for a long time . You can only wish a film as rotten as " Slackers " remained in a coma for what it 's worth , which is miniscule . Release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves . The premise kicks off under the guise of Ethan , a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell Angela . Ethan devilishly enlists the aid of David and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win Angela . I do n't like to give spoilers out , but for a piece of crap like this I can make an exception . Angela falls for David , Ethan intentionally screws everything up , the good guys win . That 's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre . Gross humor is funny , it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic " Animal House " , to the likes of contemporaries like " There 's Something About Mary " and " Road Trip " amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention . But when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far , case in point , Ethan has an Angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it . No one wants to take witness to watch Ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself . No one wants to watch a young man singing " She 'll be coming around the mountain " with a sock on his penis . But nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50 's bombshell Mamie Van Doren bare her breasts at 71 years old . I do n't know if it 's the story 's lack of coherence , which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense . Director Dewey Nicks was a former fashion photographer , and after reviewing this film , you can only wish he 'll go back to the profession . The worst thing you can do on any film , is to make it look like you 're having fun , because you detract from your objectives , just like " Slackers " does , by burying it 's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags , pointless vignettes , and lack of construction . It 's like a bunch of college students got drunk , took one 's camcorder , and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together . If you want to see a teen gross out comedy that 's actually good , then I suggest " American Pie " and " Animal House " , or " Road Trip " , just something that 's entertaining , and not dreadfully bad like " Slackers " . Coincidentally Cameron Diaz makes a cameo in this film , just as she did in another bad film such as " The Sweetest Thing " where the story treats gross humor like another plot , instead of a device much like this disaster .. If you pass by " Slackers " at your local video store , just keep on walking , and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves .
0 Well , I just ordered this on my pay - per - view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh . I have to admit , I did chuckle a few times , but I do n't even remember what parts they were at . I do n't understand why this movie was made . It claims to be a comedy but seriousuly , I do n't find a singing penis , or a naked 70 year old woman very funny . This movie was trying to fit itself into the ' gross - out ' comedies of recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip , but it just failed miserably . It was way to much gross - out then it was comedy . Also , why on earth did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie ? ! ? ! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool . I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well - done . Besides that , avoid this movie . 3/10
0 What are people on here talking about ? I must have seen a different movie than you guys . I was so bored that I walked out of the theater . What is up with this stuff . I only laughed once and not even that hard . Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten . I usually always find something I like in a movie , but this is crazy . " Slackers " makes " Not Another Teen Movie " look like a classic . It ranks up there with such trash as " Body Shots " , " Con Air " , and " Conspiracy Theory " as one of the worst of all time . AVOID AT ALL COSTS ! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies , but to my dismay that was n't happening . Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours .
0 Would n't it be great if Not Another Teen Movie actually put an end to all of these stupid , pointless , I 'm getting more sex than you are teen movies ? In a perfect world , yes . Yet this one is even worse . This one is not humiliating for the stars , it 's humiliating for the distributor . All of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have NO interest in seeing , yet it 's " funny . " Devon Sawa , who was actually good in Final Destination , is just plain dull in this movie . It makes you wonder if it 's being bad on purpose . Grade : F
0 If you enjoy films like American Pie , Road Trip & Van Wilder ; avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs . It is an unamusing , mean - spirited , insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud ; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers . Easily the worst film I have seen in the past 18 months ; mind - numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it 's runtime . Had it been much longer , I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity . Consider yourself warned !
0 This was surely the stupidest , crudest , most repulsive film I have seen in quite some time . I was tempted to turn off the VCR , but , as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident , I literally found it COMPULSIVELY HATEABLE in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end . I am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen . Animal House , Porky 's , There 's Something About Mary , both American Pie movies , and even the notorious Freddy Got Fingered I have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms . Mamie Van Doren 's breast - baring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since The Shining . Ineptly edited and shot , with incredibly annoying performances from Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman , the film ended , without the benefit of having made me giggle once . The only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture . Oh , and it would also serve nicely as a lawn fertilizer .
0 The Slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends Dave , Jeff and Sam(Devon Sawa , Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively ) , who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully . This continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie Nathan(Schwartzman ) figures out what they are up to . Nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he ca nt pursue that in normal conditions . The only problem is when the trio starts to work on it , Dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted Angela(James King ) Unfortunately , not a brilliant genre movie . Schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant . King 's performance is average , I think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look . The Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction . Jokes are as shallow as in American Pie . But are n't they all used ? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality . Overall , a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting(except for Schwartzman ) and subject . * out of * * * * *
0 Yet another venture into the realm of the teen - gross - out - comedy , set on a college campus featuring a nerd 's quest to coolness , and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl . It 's all been done before , and it 's all been done in a far more satisfying manner . The gross - out humor that has made teen flicks like " American Pie " and " Dude ! Where 's my Car " so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment , appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove . The film is badly written , and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable . I wo n't even dignify this terrible picture by divulging , as it 's a waste of my time and yours . At best , Slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter , and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable . < br /><br />Jason Schwarzman , who impressed in his debut Rushmore , humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast . Please avoid , please avoid . Save your money .
0 This film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad . The premise was O.K , but the plot itself was terrible . The actors tried their best with limited material , but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film . Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely irritating - even more so than in Rushmore , the rest of the cast were quite non - eventful . Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off - putting & incredibly juvenile . Tries to be a Road Trip / American Pie but fails dismally on all levels . A total waste of everyone 's time .
0 This movie has no plot and no focus . Yes , it 's supposed to be a slap - stick , stupid comedy , but the screen - writers have no idea what the movie was about . Even the title does n't go along with the movie . It should have been called " Cool Ethan " or " Cheaters Never Win " or something like that . The characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them ! The girl roommate character ( from That 70 's Show ) was the only person worth watching . She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in . The others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they 'll need a career other than acting .
0 Dave ( Devon Sawa ) and his friends Sam ( Jason Segel ) and Jeff ( Michael Maronna ) have scammed their way through college . When creepy Ethan ( Jason Schwartzman ) discovers their secret , he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful , good - hearted student Angela ( James King).<br /><br />Stupid and incompetent " comedy " - a lot more groan - inducing than laugh - inducing . Movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags - but NONE OF THEM WORK . What 's more , it 's full of worthless , unappealing characters - and Schwartzman 's character is so repulsive he 's a major turn - off . Movie even tries using 50's/60 's sexpot / actress Mamie Van Doren in the movie 's most outrageous scene . YUCK!!!<br /><br />Further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste ( yet again ) of veteran comedic actor Joe Flaherty 's talent - when 's this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile?<br /><br />All in all , the only thing I liked was James ( a.k.a . Jaime ) King , who was very appealing - and deserved better.<br /><br />This gets no more than one out of ten from me .
0 Slackers is just another teen movie that 's not really worth watching . Dave ( Devon Sawa ) , Sam ( Jason Segel ) and Jeff ( Michael C. Maronna ) are about to graduate from Holden University with Honors in lying , cheating and scheming . The three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now , during final exams , these big - men - on - campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school . The plot is very stupid and there 's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while . Slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre . The comedy in Slackers is either hit or miss but there 's no real true funny or original moment in the movie . Its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny . Though for every joke that works there 's at least eight more that do n't . The screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy . Even if they do they probably wo n't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy . Jason Schwartzman plays the freaky Ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low . Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film . This is directed by Dewey Nicks and this is his first film so you ca n't blame him too much . The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon though , she 's not in the movie very much . The film is very short at only 86 minutes long however , that may be too long for some people who do n't really like this type of humor . Slackers is n't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average . When compared to other films in the genre there 's a lot better out there such as Not Another Teen Movie , American Pie and its sequels , Scary Movie 1 & 2 etc . So unless you have seen most of them and you 're looking for something new then Slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else . Rating 4.3/10 a below average teen comedy that 's worth skipping .
0 ( David H. Steinberg ) 's script seemed initially having some real smart points that could 've made good romantic comedy , BUT BUT BUT , oh dear ! What did ever happen in the way ? ? ? ! ! ! ! < br /><br />I'll tell you what happened . Originally it 's ( Animal House - 1978 ) and ( Porky 's - 1982 ) . Although that was long time ago , but those are the pioneers , the godfathers of the new genre : the crude teen comedy . Then the 1990s came . After important instances that became smash hits ( repulsive ones am I add ) such as ( Problem Child - 1990 ) , ( Dumb and Dumber - 1994 ) , ( The Nutty Professor - 1996 ) , and ( There 's Something About Mary - 1998 ) which I think slackers is affected by , there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era , the one and only : ( American Pie - 1999 ) which 's undoubtedly and incomparably a genre 's icon . After that I think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy , cum laude nasty , to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion ! < br /><br />I believe that ( Slackers ) had a smart plot first as a script , then its makers got to add some real big amount of : rudeness , filthiness , strangely shameless sex to be made - at those days - as easy as pie ! Like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as : masturbation , oral sex , urination .. etc just to look a la ' mode . They 're wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely THEY ARE so necessary to make the profits , and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies . The problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it.<br /><br />Some of its moments looked literally horrible , and that as you see is the point . It 's all in ( Jason Schwartzman ) 's looks and performance ; memorably disgusting to the utmost . So the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what was n't done before of pure skinning images . To be more like a horror where you 're asking all the time ; what nastier would happen ? ( vomiting , farting , .. etc ) ; these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays.<br /><br />Though even if you hated it you 've got to love something ( mostly for being bold ) , for me it was only Gina Gershon cameo 's scene . Anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outrages - for - outrageousness , like an adolescent 's naughty dream . Though the majority of it was near to anybody 's nightmare.<br /><br />What made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work , and not another cheap , another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be . Remember well the details of stealing the exam ( the first 2 minutes ) , so the movie 's main plot ( weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys ) through the pattern of ( boy loves girl , and girl loves another boy ) because save that , it 's nothing but a candidly schlock . It dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys , who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything , would do . It ended up as being , and I 'm sorry to say it , a smiling sh*t ! < br /><br />At its end it said something ( can you imagine ! ) about how it 's the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win , totally like this comedy itself . It sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie ; which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one .. Once ! And it does n't need much to understand that this movie 's makers were the real slackers ! Maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood , but even if .. The final result here was n't at least witty by any sense of the word . < br /><br />P.S : Its scriptwriter ( David H. Steinberg ) , who wrote the story of ( American Pie 2 ) as well , has a main page at the IMDb where you 'll find under the " Additional Details " his usual " Plot Keywords " which are : Sex / Vulgarity / Crude Humor / ... They just forgot to write Urineing while Showering or Baring 70 Year Old Women !
0 Nominated for the oscar " worst script ever " in my opinion . There 's no decent story , rediculous acting , VERY lousy humor . By every means possible , if you have little self respect please do n't waste your time seeing this movie . Although u can see the actors CAN act , it leaves you dumber after watching it . Precious braincells are being killed watching this crap ... <br /><br />i warned u < br /><br />DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE
0 Although I had some hopes for this film , particularly since I enjoy the acting of Jason Segel ( Freaks & Geeks , Undeclared ) so much , I must say it was one of the worst films I 've seen in recent memory ( Loser and Dr T and the Women are also on that list).<br /><br />Yes , there were a couple of laugh out loud moments , although the movie could have been so much better . The premise was not bad- scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they 're discovered by someone with a proposition for them . The problem is that the characters were all so unlikable , that I did n't care about any of them . The blackmailer ( played by talented Jason Schwartzman ) was such a psychopath that it was n't that funny to watch him- he was n't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way , he was just a crazy loser , who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch . The editing of the movie was hard to follow-- it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which . Only two or three of the gang 's scams were really shown , you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists-- showing their schemes would have made for a better movie . The so - called love story was absurd and unbelievable , in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout . I could go on about the movie 's shortcomings , but you get the idea . Not worth the $ 4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent !
0 This centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt . < br /><br />Merrill berates the distraught boy to stop his ' whining ' about Rennie 's death . Old - style real men in action , here.<br /><br />The crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen.<br /><br />The storytelling itself , despite the flashback sequences , plays it straight -- all the narrators are trusted by us ( regardless of the ' truth ' or ' untruth ' of the dialogue ) , so there 's no game with the viewer about narrative structure . This would become a rough template for future retellings , such as " Fearless".<br /><br />So all we 're left with is individual performance , and at that level , it 's best for Wynn 's bantering , a virtual one - man show .
0 About halfway through , I realized I did n't care about these characters in the least ; however , I watched a bit more anyway . Regrettably , I came back the next day and finished it . I should n't have bothered.<br /><br />If you know * anything * about the film beforehand , you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what 's gon na happen afterward - he 's gon na get on the phone and call people about it ! That was almost as bad as " Snakes on a Plane " ( another bad aviation catastrophe flick).<br /><br />I realize this is an old film , and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today . But even by those standards , the acting was embarrassing . These were n't characters , they were stereotypes . I suspect this movie was , more than anything , an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband 's ( Gary Merrill ) career . To no avail however - I have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did.<br /><br />Davis ' playing the happy cripple ( i.e. , a non - glamorous role ) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move . It was n't . It was just boring . She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film , making Trask ( Merrill 's character ) see the truth about love and forgiveness ( although she was less winsome than Tiny Tim ) , calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died.<br /><br />The final scene , where Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to reconcile , was so affected and over - acted on both ends of the phone line , I almost cringed . I had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie . If you found it uplifting , that 's great . But frankly , I just found it bad . There are plenty of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were far better written and acted .
0 In fact , Marc Blitzstein 's off - Broadway adaptation of " Threepenny " was not so " bowdlerised " as is generally believed.<br /><br />(I have a special interest in " Threepenny " ; my dad was part of the first full production in the US ; U of Illlinois Theatre Guild did it around the end of WW2 . HJitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages { neither English } , a German prompter 's script and similar sources . ) Blitzstein 's adaptation -- not a " translation " -- which had the full approval of Lotte Lenya -- was a lot closer to the original than generally believed.<br /><br />The problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the MGM cast recording ( recently available on Polygram on CD)(which includes Beatrice Arthur { as Lucy , the " big complete girl " , and ca n't i see her hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on that line -- Bea was a major babe in the 50 's } , Paul Dooley and John Astin ) was heavily censored by Mike Curb , head of MGM Records -- i mean , 17 ( i think it was ) " Goddamn"s got cut to just " damn".<br /><br />(At one time , MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the * entire * play , doubtless as heavily censored . )
0 The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy - duty cast list should n't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music - hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more Lionel ' Oliver ' Blair than Brecht . The acting talent is shamefully misused : Migenes and Walters are good but do n't have to try very hard : Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack , but struggles with the character , straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is embarrassingly mannered and Polly is atrocious . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often awkward : it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , but at least his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist - shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain - basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap , shoddy and thoughtlessly made . Disgraceful .
0 This movie was different in that it did n't show the typical gay stereotypes that I 'm used to seeing . But that does n't change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline . I 'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen , since Black gay characters are seldom seen , and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed . But , how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning , middle and end . Or how about a story that was focused . There really does n't seem to be a point to this film , and even though it is a low budget film , that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot .
0 What can you say about this movie ? It was not terrible , but it was not good ! Two days earlier I had watched Lillies and that was one of the best Gay films I have ever seen . So this was not the best time to watch a mediocre Gay flick.<br /><br />The story was silly and the acting was OK . It was not bad enough to turn off , but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping . It was not very well cast either.<br /><br />Would I recommend this movie ? No you would be wasting your time and money . I do n't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them . Spend your time Watching Noah 's Arc on Logo instead . I think this is where this movie was trying to go but never got there .
0 Channel surfing and caught this on LOGO . It was one of those " I have to watch this because it 's so horribly bad " moments , like Roadhouse without the joy . The writing is atrocious ; completely inane and the acting is throw - up - in - your - mouth bad.<br /><br />There 's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again . I mean , the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is , well , ordinary which is no big deal , but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the Sistine Chapel . I 'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10 ' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame . I guess they did n't learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training ( see hotel room check scene) ... wow a toilet ! ! ! yaayyyyy ! ! ! ! I do n't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine . If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well , you know the rest.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague.<br /><br />edit : Apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since I disliked this movie , I am an " obvious hater " which I can only assume means I am phobic , which of course is not true . I decided to do this wacky , crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence ( i.e. its refreshing to see ... )<br /><br />Sure , it may be refreshing to see but that does n't equate into a great movie , just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction . In fact , I applaud the effort . Frankly , I 'd rather go listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalogue than watch this again .
0 I 'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments . There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it 's essentially pre - spoiled.<br /><br />This movie derives a few ideas from a Southern classic , To Kill A Mockingbird . I suppose maybe TKOM got its ideas from some source .... at any rate , after you watch this , you 'll say , " Oh yeah , that is a ripoff".<br /><br />I think the truly entertaining thing about these McMovies is once you 've identified a plot element , is to figure out whether they 'll stick with the original , or try to twist it around . Not a lot of twists in this one .
0 When this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel . There 's nothing special here that you need to see . Story is about two married couples from Arkansas who go on a trip together to Reno . Couple number one is Lonnie Earl Dodd ( Billy Bob Thornton ) who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage . His wife is Darlene ( Natasha Richardson ) and she has a low self opinion of herself and they have n't been intimate in a long time . Lonnie has been sleeping with Candy ( Charlize Theron ) who is the wife of his best friend Roy Kirkendall ( Patrick Swayze ) . They all drive to Reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite . Roy and Candy have been trying to have a baby and finally Candy discovers that she is pregnant . But Roy phones his doctor in Arkansas and finds out that he 's sterile . Candy and Lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos . This film is directed by Jordan Brady and he 's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive . Unfortunately Brady does n't show much comedic flair but you ca n't lay all the blame on him . This script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level . Just because they 're all from the south does n't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic . Thornton 's character does n't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar . And Swayze 's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day . Penelope Cruz pops up as a prostitute and it 's a totally worthless and pointless cameo . She barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines ! I think she was fulfilling an obligation to Harvey and Bob Weinstein who are executive producers for this film . The only person who actually is n't to bad is Richardson . We watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche . All of these actors should know better and it 's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it . It 's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid . As for the viewers , your not getting paid so skip this one !
0 < br /><br />What an absolutely crappy film this is . How or why this movie was made and what the hell Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me . Strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick : DO NOT waste your time on this ' film ' .
0 I 've seen some crappy movies in my life , but this one must be among the very worst . Definately bottom 100 material ( imo , that is).<br /><br />We follow two couples , the Dodds ( Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene ) and the Kirkendalls ( Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy ) in one car on a roadtrip to Reno.<br /><br />Apparently , Lonnie is n't too happy with his sex - life , so he cheats on his wife with Candy , who 's despirately trying to have a baby . Roy , meanwhile , is n't too sure if his sperm is OK so he 's getting it checked by a doctor.<br /><br />Now , I had read the back of the DVD , but my girlfriend did n't , and she blurted out after about 20 minutes : ' oh yeah , she 's gon na end up pregnant but her husband ca n't have any baby 's ' . Spot on , as this movie is soooo predictable . As well as boring . And annoying . Meaningless . Offensive . Terrible.<br /><br />An example of how much this movie stinks . The two couples set out in their big car towards Nevada , when they are stopped by 2 police - officers , as they did n't stop at a stop - sign . The guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer . Not only is this scene pointless and not important ( or even relevant ) for the movie , it takes about 5 minutes ! It 's just talk and talk and talk , without ever going somewhere.<br /><br />I still have to puke thinking about the ending though . Apparently , Roy ISN'T having problems down there so he IS the father of the child . How many times does that happen in the movies ... try something new ! The cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after . Yuck.<br /><br />Best scene of the movie is right at the end , with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon . Why could n't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes?<br /><br />One would expect more from this cast ( although Thornton really tries ) , but you ca n't really blame them . Writers , shame on you!<br /><br />1/10 .
0 Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton , and the diversity of his skills , I noticed this movie listed , and was surprised I had n't heard of it.<br /><br />I'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 , and when it hit theaters more than 2 - 1/2 years later ( that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production).<br /><br />Now Patrick Swayze ca n't act for sour apples , but Thornton has more than enough ability to make - up for the difference between them . And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see , even if it showed her watching paint dry.<br /><br />Being curious , I checked this site 's production info . It made a whopping < $ 600 per screen its opening weekend , and just over $ 400 each , after its month 's theater run in latter 2002 . Overall gross was $ 261 K , which I 'd doubt could cover cast and crew 's hotel and food for a week on location.<br /><br />The story is pretty benign , and even the use of the usually interesting locale of Reno is as dull as the rest of the goings - on.<br /><br />It 's something like several SNL bits all pieced together , none individually too great at all , and the overall presentation even worse.<br /><br />Whatever , the expenses for this production had to be considerable - even if all worked for less than their usual fees - so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bob 's present ( albeit understandably somewhat laconic here , compared with his usual work.<br /><br />Think of the three superb , totally diverse characters he portrayed in " Sling Blade , " " Bandits " and " Bad Santa , " and you know he realized this work was below standard , long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this . One star for him , even here , and one because production was better than , say , the typical " Lifetime " flick .
0 If you hate redneck accents , you 'll hate this movie . And to make it worse , you see Patrick Swayze , a has been trying to be a redneck . I really ca n't stand redneck accents . I like Billy Bob Thornton , he was good in Slingblade , but he was annoying in this movie . And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl ? How much more hickish can this movie get ? The storyline was stupid . I 'm usually not this judgemental of movies , but I could n't stand this movie . If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie , go see Slingblade.<br /><br />My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... figures ... I think I 'll wrap it up and give it to my Grandma for Christmas . It could just be that I ca n't stand redneck accents usually , or that I ca n't stand Patrick Swayze . Maybe if Patrick Swayze was n't in it . I did n't laugh once in the movie . I laugh at anything stupid usually . If they had shown someones fingers getting smashed , I might have laughed . people 's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh .
0 Simply , I found the TV show " Mash " trite , preachy , oh ever so " politically correct " , repetitious , pretentious and biggest sin of all , and that is , ? that it is ( was ) incredibly dull . You have Alan Alda as the main lead , " ( star ) " , who is so in love with himself and his cleverness , that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode . The original series had both McLean Stevson , and Wayne Rogers , whom I 'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation . However , Harry ( Henry ) Morgan , and Mike Farrell , both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread . Loretta Swit , which I also found dull , also to no fault of her own was n't a wonder to look at , and Gary Burghoff , who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on . Seeing one show a year showed that to me . Jamie Farr was just low brow " comedy " and is not even worth really mentioning here at all . The reason I did not give it a ( one ) rating , which anyone reading this by now would be wondering , is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call , but a relative one . Television , except for relatively few exceptions , is such crud . That relatively speaking , Mash had some production quality , ( by television standards ) of that era and today , and therefore it is deserved of a two . Rob Ritter
0 I respect the fact that this is a very popular show . However , in comparison with Robert Altman 's ingenious , hilarious , zany , and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic , this show was probably destined to be less - than - mediocre ... even if it did run for 11 years , that does n't necessarily make it any good . This show formed an all - too - integral part of my early childhood ( it was on re - runs every night , and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up ) , but it 's one of the memories I do n't miss . And now that I actually have seen the movie , I can give this series an accurate critique . On its own , it 's not nearly " 2 out of 10 " bad . However , the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie . Some of them technically are the same , but they 're only similar in name . For instance , since when is Alan Alda anything like Donald Sutherland ? His style of humor is totally different , as are his characterization and outlook . The new characters are not that great ; they just serve to make you miss the ones that they 're replacing . It 's the same with the new actors ( including Jamie Farr ) . The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar , who 's still ( even though played by the same actor ) merely a pale imitation of the original . What else ? Oh , yeah . With a laugh track ( it did n't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not ) , it comes across as creepy , due to what 's going on in the other settings . And because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual Korean War , it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that does n't work outside the world of cartoons . I 've never liked this show , and I never will .
0 I was so excited when I discovered this was available ! I could n't wait to see it . What a waste of energy ! It 's kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store . Being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery . But once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album . This DVD is only recommended for ' completionists ' who must have everything Lynch has done . " Six Men Getting Sick " is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive . It lacks the power of Lynch 's later work " The Grandmother " is quite simply an immature work . It 's tedious and looks like a student film . But it was the 70's ... It 's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director . But you can see , briefly , the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds . " The Alpahabet " is forgettable ( No really ! I ca n't remember this one at all ! ) " The Amputee " is pointless . " The Cowboy and the Frenchman " is just plain silly . " Lumiere " is the only worthwhile one in the bunch . Without dialog Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work . I had to watch this one several times . But it runs less than 2 minutes . Hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD .
0 I saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s & 70s , yes it IS gruesome , and could be the progenitor of the " Faces of Death " series popular in the 80s & 90s . Considering the state of so - called " driver education " these days , this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive . When you see violent death in all its gore & horror , you certainly ( if you have any sensibility at all ) get a truer perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely , what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do . I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s & 80s , and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class . I found this film in the company library , showed it at the session , a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room ! Incredibly , most of them later said " I never knew a car accident could be so terrible ! " This film , and another , " RED ASPHALT " , is certainly reality in its most graphic form . I 'll never forget it , I only wish I could have found a copy when my children were attending " driver 's ed " in high school !
0 Supposedly a " social commentary " on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970 's , " Nightmare " is full of bad Southern stereotypes , complete with phoney accents . Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners , this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly - disguised " babe in prison " movie -- especially in its uncut original version . Nevertheless , acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors , in particular , does a good job of making viewers hate him -- even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes . There 's also a change - of - pace role for the late Robert Reed , who appears as the lecherous warden , and Tina Louise ( previously Ginger of " Gilligan 's Island " ) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard . My grade : D. < br /><br / >
0 Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week . This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town . They are n't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they 're there . What follows is rape , torture , beatings , humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion.<br /><br />The TV version was ( for its time ) grim . No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down . The unrated version is even worse -- there 's plentiful nudity , the violence is extreme and , in one particularly disgusting sequence , we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard " uses " her . YUCK ! There 's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink . You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded -- all this is shoved in your face like you 're supposed to enjoy it . The needlessly downbeat ending does n't help.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good -- but that actually makes the movie harder to watch . A sick , sleazy film . Not recommended .
0 This movie forever left an impression on me . I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night . I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the " Brady Bunch " . I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was horrendous and evil . However , this movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women 's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives , one at a time . What fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie . None of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when I discuss this movie because they did n't see it .
0 Now for the truth , its very very weak storyline - for a Walt Disney film its total rubbish . When the robinson appear , the films all over the place , I was shocked how poor it was . It like " alice in wonderland " gone wrong!. It feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it - and they do n't . After that , I sat there wishing for the end . My younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story . The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you do n't care about the ending , you just want the film to finish . Its a film to forget , and forget quickly . If you 've got some spare time , do n't waste it on this .
0 This movie started out with some semblance of a plot , then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward . It was impossible to remain engaged with this film . This movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability . It is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio . Clearly there are morale and motivation problems at Disney , not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control . That management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation . This movie joins my very short " worst movies of all time " list .
0 I really wanted to like this film , but so much of it is stolen / borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant . The New York Times ' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers ' cartoon ( ' Hello my baby , hello my darlin ' , hello my ragtime gal ... ' ) . But I challenge anyone to watch the Fox / Blue Sky animated feature Robots ( 2005 ) and not find ridiculous similarities in : storyline - A young inventor growing up , and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.<br /><br />cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments.<br /><br /> ... robots ... - The servant robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to those in Robots , and both films use a sort of retro - futuristic look.<br /><br />All of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from Disney at the end , implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back ( which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other , with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity).<br /><br />The filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own , and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction , as though we do n't have the attention span for anything less.<br /><br />The villain is really well - designed and brilliantly animated , and he 's a pleasure to watch . Much of the rest of the film seems thrown - together . Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s.<br /><br />The film actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short . By the end of this cartoon , we are reminded that Disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue .
0 I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son . He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did . The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion . In fact , I had a very hard time paying attention at all . The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out.<br /><br />Not to say that the film is n't an interesting concept , it 's just told so oddly , ( bad screenplay ? ) especially when we " meet the family " for the first time . I know we 're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord , they could 've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes ( seemingly , I did n't actually time it ) . By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit .
0 I wanted to like this movie . But it falls apart in the middle . the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely , but the middle runs off tangent . The people I watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course , and hoping it would end sooner than it did . Another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment ! I found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the Schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot . I bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well , but it lacks Pixar 's writing and soul . I think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule , while missing the plot . People old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily . Edit out most of the middle section , make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid flick . I wish I had better things to say . But I do n't
0 I kinda liked the film despite it 's frenzied pace . BUT , I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North . It is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be . Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world , and that is one reason why . Stop teaching the kids of the United States of America to think they own the planet . Such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world 's great nations . Even in jest . I would never refer to the USA as ' Alberta South ' . Walt would never put us down , so why start now . Other than that the film was pretty goofy , better luck next time .
0 I do agree that though this story by Melville just might be unfilmable , this is n't even a credible try . To move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story 's intent and nature ; possibly you might have been able to move it over to England , but it must be a period piece . Even our story narrator -- the proprietor -- tells it in a flashback , going back even further , somewhere around 1800 . Towards the end of the 19th century , a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought . And the 20th century ? Come on ! Give me an expletive deleted break ! ! ! Even around 1800 , such behavior did n't work very well , in view of the ending . And the movie 's ending ? I do n't know what it was , because I did n't watch the entire travesty -- I had to stop . This was like setting " Streetcar Named Desire " in Elizabethan England .
0 A noble effort , I guess , but ultimately a poor one . Before seeing this film , I felt " Bartleby , The Scrivener " was unfilmable . After seeing it , I still do . Unfortunately , I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on , and they will be upset at the film 's needless revisions ( updating from 1850 to 1970 , moving from New York to London ) . Even the superb talents of Paul Scofield ca n't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film Melville 's metaphysical classic .
0 This is a terrible production of Bartleby , though not , as the other reviewer put it because it is " unfilmable , " but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book . It tells the story , almost painfully so . Watching it , I could turn the pages in my book and follow along , which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation . Rather , see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover . That version , while humorous , brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel . What 's important is the spirit , not the minutiae of things like setting , character names , and costumes . The difference between these film versions is like night and day , tedious and hilarious . This version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly , painful , mind - numbing schlock .
0 You might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made - for from the beginning , since the credits list Susan Dey as " Special Guest Star . " Um , why would a one - off MOW like this have a guest star ? Well , if you stick with it , you 'll find yourself paying attention to little else but Ms. Dey 's butt , wiggling in a flowered bikini as the " Partridge Family " house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes . Susan 's derrière is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo - disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene . Sadly , Susie and her tush fight a losing battle : the jiggle - TV craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off , so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role . In 1976 Fat Freddy Silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as Susan 's audition tape for " Charlie 's Angels . " As is , our Susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber , neurotic women.<br /><br />The view beyond Susan 's heinie , it must be said , is not very compelling . The scenery is nice , and photographed in a bizarre , hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera . Nope . It 's just a typically suspense - challenged 70 's made - for - TV thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash(and collect some cable residuals , though they obviously did n't know that at the time ) and show off their " range . " Here we 're treated to a TV - scale nuclear family , squaring off against TV - scale thugs who ca n't decide whether they 're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult ( thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies ) and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television : do n't mess with Dennis Weaver ( see " McCloud " and " Duel " ) . The only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage - son character of Steve , played by the long - forgotten ( if ever - remembered ) Kristoffer Tabori , who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is ( supposedly ) menacing his family . But Steve , as played by Tabori ( gosh , why did n't we see more from this wunderkind ? ) , is actually just grumpy and moody and is n't one bit conflicted when big D gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial ( and literal ) sand . For the sleep - deprived and Susan Deyniacs ( there must be some of you out there ) only .
0 I ca n't believe I waste my time watching this garbage ! I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an " AA " rating , and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment.<br /><br />The acting was OK , but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication . The plot is ludicrous , the motivations of the " bad guys " totally absent , and the various family interactions silly and shallow . For example , Dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is BAD , but he turns out to be an " admirable " person NOT because of his " ignore the idiots " philosophy , but because he 's pretty good with his fists ... <br /><br />The ONLY message I was able to glean from this pap was that the nuclear family is Good and alternate living arrangements are Bad . Oh , and Bad people happen to Good people .
0 Being born in the 1960 's I grew up watching the TV " Movies of the Week " in the early 70 's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including " Crowhaven Farm " , " Bad Ronald " , " Satan 's School for Girls " , " Kolchak the Night Stalker " , etc , but this one is just plain dumb . This is obviously the writer 's trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier . The movie stars Dennis Weaver of " McCloud " and " Duel " fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach . The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family . The reason for this is never explained , and Weaver 's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow . For God 's sake , call the police , beat the hell of them or something , just do n't sit there and whine about it . The acting is pretty lame , the story unbelievable , etc . Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but that 's about it . Ignore this if it ever airs on TV .
0 The story is a little slow and a little stupid . Greta Garbo does n't look very good and I could n't understand half the things she said because of her accent , which was exaggerated for this role . Melvyn Douglas , meanwhile , plays his normal unlikeable role and Constance Bennett is just so - so except for a couple of her screams , which were funny . < br /><br />On the plus side , Roland Young had the best role in the film . I wish he had more lines , as he disappeared in the second half of the story . Also , it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young . I had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late ' 60s to the ' 80s and a whacked out old woman . Story - wise , the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis , pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes . That was amazing and humorous footage.<br /><br />Overall , I can see where this film - Garbo 's last - was not a box - office success . It just drags too much , going on and on about deceptions . It 's an annoying story . Garbo knew it , too , and called it quits .
0 It seems a shame that Greta Garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken - identity marital romp . Coming off the success of her first romantic comedy , Ernst Lubitsch 's masterful " Ninotchka " ( 1939 ) , where she was ideally cast as an austere Russian envoy , Garbo is reunited with her leading man Melvyn Douglas for a sitcom - level story that has her playing Karin Borg , a plain - Jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive Larry Blake when he becomes smitten with her . Once he makes clear that work is his priority , Karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high - living twin sister Katherine to test her husband 's fidelity when he is back in Manhattan.<br /><br />It 's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by George Cukor , who led Garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937 's " Camille " , because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend . Only someone with Carole Lombard 's natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by - the - numbers script by S.N. Behrman , Salka Viertel and George Oppenheimer . MGM 's intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and Americanize Garbo 's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties.<br /><br />However , Garbo appears ill - at - ease mostly as the bogus party girl Katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like Douglas and Constance Bennett as romantic rival Griselda . Photographed unflatteringly by Joseph Ruttenberg , Garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the " chica - choca " dance sequence . The story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where Larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of Sonny Bono 's death . Roland Young and Ruth Gordon ( in a rare appearance at this point of her career ) show up in comic supporting roles as Douglas ' associates . This movie is not yet on DVD , and I would n't consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in Garbo 's otherwise legendary career . She was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming . I can see why .
0 I 've never understood the appeal of Garbo . She always comes across in her films as stuck up , not all that alluring , and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section . She was also a very limited actress , like Gloria Swanson far better off left in the silent era . In this her last film , her performance is very average and even unassured . She tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting.<br /><br />A would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground ( even though Melvyn Douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes , which are really the only amusing thing here).<br /><br />There was potential but the script fails in almost every department , wasting every actor in it . Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one is n't even a spot on Ninotchka , which I also found to be extremely overrated .
0 Payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later . Why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangster 's own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around ? Why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love ? Surely the hero , here Kevin Costner , must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence . Anthony Quinn , great actor that he was , surely deserved better , and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming . Stowe is okay but her Spanish accent does n't work . The cameos of the lesser players are good , especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star .
0 Faces are slashed , throats are cut , blood squirts , and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die . They even blow up Kevin Costner 's dog with a shotgun . Why would anyone want to see a movie like this ? Violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys , not the other way around . Take for instance Underworld and Underworld Evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain . In this movie , the good guys are cut up . See the difference ? Why would anyone want to MAKE a movie that depresses the audience ? Beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent . Let 's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse .
0 This movie wastes virtually every actor 's talents in what could best be charitably called a " potboiler".<br /><br />Despite it 's action - packed ' Top Gun ' opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn.<br /><br />There are so many dead - end story lines in this movie I was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded TV series.<br /><br />Quinn 's Mexican drug - lord role is laughable and his ' associates ' plucked right out of a 1970 's Quinn - Martin cop show . Costner 's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with Mendez ' wife . Nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming along.<br /><br />Definitely a ' B ' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved .
0 I just watched this movie and I 've got ta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there ! ! ! A friend lent me this movie and I watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story . < br /><br />Well , the movie started off with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot retiring ... why ? Why did they make him a fighter pilot ? He was supposedly going to be hired by Anthony Quinn 's character to be his new pilot ... well , we never see Costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie ! < br /><br />Costner runs into a Texan ( James Gammon ) selling a horse to a big Mexican businessman and Costner tags along for a ride . Without knowing what happened , Gammon is beat to near death and Costner drives him to the meeting , which happens to be with an associate of Quinn ! But , nothing comes of it ... nada , zilcho ! Why did they have Gammon 's character ? Why did they have the horse sale with the Quinn associate if nothing was to come of it ? < br /><br />Also , after they leave Costner for dead , they make Madeline Stowe 's character become a whore , then she attacks one of Quinn 's men that was paying for a turn ... she stabs him with his own knife , and the next thing she 's been moved to a convent ! No explanation as to why she was moved , or when it was done!<br /><br />Too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing ! ! I only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it ... I 'm going to throw it at him for the 2 hours I wasted of my life watching the blasted thing !
0 Revenge on us the viewing public perhaps . I sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title . But Costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends . I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was . If a movie is called Revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film . I had a choice of seeing this or Black Rain at the cinema thankfully i saw The other brothers movie at the cinema instead.i caught up with this turkey on video . there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune . Listen to the cd.dont watch this its awful . 1 out of 10
0 This has to be some of the worst direction I 've seen . The close - up can be a very powerful shot , but when every scene consists of nothing but close - ups , it loses all its impact . < br /><br />Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with , the backdrops of Mexico , the cantinas , the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives , and the dusty towns Costner rolls through on his journey for revenge . Unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big , giant head . Even the transition scenes where Costner is driving alone across Mexico quickly cut to a close - up . < br /><br />The score is over - dramatic and intrusive , dictating every emotion we should feel . The story itself should have been handled much better . Among other things , too many people pop up out of nowhere to help Costner along - it 's just bad writing . < br /><br />It 's a typical thriller storyline , but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it . Costner 's No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline , but it was a much better movie . < br /><br />The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film . This movie was never going to be great , but if we saw more of Mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable .
0 Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV - Production . I saw very much promotion Material and expect a professionell Movie like " Stormriders " - what i was presented was a Low - Budget - Movie like " XENA " or " Hercules " on TV . No Atmosphere , very boring , more then worse Fight - Scenes . Some good ideas - not more . I hope i will get the Chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie!!!<br /><br />My ASIAN - Tips : " MUSA - THE WARRIOR " , " STORMRIDERS " , " SHAOLIN SOCCER " , " BATTLE ROYAL " , " VERSUS " , etc.<br /><br />Sorry for my bad English !
0 " Shinobi " is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story . Unfortunately , for the audience to actually care about the people dying , you have to develop the characters , otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence . The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters , all of whom die.<br /><br />OK , so if you ca n't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way , you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible , right ? Nope . Here we have a war between two ninja clans , with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other . They kill each other because the emperor says so . Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead , they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions . That 's not stubbornness ... that 's just plain dumb.<br /><br />Fine , fine ! There is no character development , and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting . At least they die fighting in cool action scenes , right ? Yet again , NO ! In fact , many of the fights are n't even fights at all : super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly ( and lamely , in my opinion ) . I 'm talking about things like , " Lalala , I 'm walking along and I- * neck gets slashed*. " THE END for that character . Not even halfway through the film , I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it .
0 I have watched anime but I 'm not a die hard fan ; and I do n't read manga . I say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background . I have seen " St. John 's Wort , " and although it is n't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination , it made me pick up " Shinobi , " especially since everyone seems to love it.<br /><br />Well , I watched it this afternoon , and fought very hard to keep watching . Yes , it 's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes , the autumn leaves on the trees , even the CGI eye flicker - majestic . I liked the hawk , the costumes , even some of the fight scenes , but overall this was dull as dirt.<br /><br />It seemed as if someone took " Romeo and Juliet " - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some " X - Men " for good measure . Two of the characters split Wolverine 's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey - haired guy had his ability to heal himself . Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that 's Poison Ivy ( from Batman ) . Why do they give these women such dumb powers ? Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death . Man , that 's some great power for you . And the other girl , can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands . The other woman , one of the star crossed lovers , has the power of a hypnotic stare . Wow.<br /><br />I sort of made it to the end of the film , by fast forwarding it , and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected . Some people are comparing this to " House of Flying Daggers " and " Hero . " Do n't make that mistake . They may share similar endings , but that 's where the similarities end . " Shinobi " is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker.<br /><br />I would say avoid this film unless you 're 12 to 18 years old .
0 I gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity . My intention is not to burst anyone 's bubble , because I 've seen , as I 've skimmed through other comments , that this movie is quite appreciated by many . Well , it is not worth any praises , and I say this because I 've seen the original anime , Basilisk , and this movie shames it deeply . Perhaps if you see Shinobi alone , you could like it . It is enjoyable due to the well - choreographed battles , based on fantasy more than on martial arts , and I agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced . But the story is nothing like the original one . Now , I understand that when one transforms an anime / manga into a movie , one must make certain changes . I was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime , although they have a well - established role , and some are truly profound and well - designed . But I certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly - placed changes , that basically ruin the entire story . Characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated , transformed in something the public might love more , perhaps . For instance , Oboro , who , in the anime is a sweet , innocent girl , completely and utterly in love with Gennosuke , becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie . I liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era ( we are talking about Japan , 17th century ) , but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written . Hotarubi , which is one of my favourite characters in the film , but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature , becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime , but is more or less worthless in the plot . I could go on and on , like how they made Tenzen , the worst and most dangerous character in the anime , exceptionally weak and unattractive , or how Gennosuke , the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused , not to mention , again WEAK . The music is beautiful and the image is astounding , which was expected of a Japanese movie , and I appreciate it for that . But do not watch this if you 've seen and enjoyed Basilisk , because it is just hopeless . Basilisk , although based on fantasy , with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters , storyline , historical value and it is , may I say , heartbreaking . Shinobi was a waste of time and I could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax . Alas , it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly , but I advise you against it . Please , watch the anime , or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what Basilisk really is by watching the anime . Otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they 've massacred it .
0 The bad out takes from " Reign of Fire " strung together , without any real story.<br /><br />Dean Cain tries to be a real actor , and fails again.<br /><br />In the end the dragons quit in disgust.<br /><br />BARF !
0 I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing . About the only thing I could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie . No proper character development , wait , I 'm not even sure they were characters . Set - ups were hokey and inane , and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they could n't even synchronize with alternate shots . If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would . Sadly , it is n't even worth the time for a few laughs.<br /><br / > It 's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood , and now I waste my time even thinking about it .
0 Why else would he do this to me?<br /><br />Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies . Or even decent movies . I saw Lois and Clark , I am aware of just how ... " good " Dean Cain is.<br /><br />Obviously this is gon na be a cheesey flick , and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head . I will not call these spoilers as you ca n't really spoil this movie any more than it already is.<br /><br />To begin with ... why is that a fake helicopter ? I mean ... why?<br /><br />How come that one scientist is from Chicago and that other scientist is from LA and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried ? How hard would it have been to get either an american actor , or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people are n't american?<br /><br />Why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line ? We get helipad - day and then mess hall - day later on . And then that 's it , who cares about the timeline . To be honest , who cared about it even when they mentioned it , but I guess that 's beside the point.<br /><br />Does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens ? The answer is no.<br /><br />That dragon sure can walk down that hall .. over .. and over ... and over .... and over ... <br /><br />Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history ? It was straight out of scooby doo . Oh , the dragon 's dead now ... say , wanna get dinner ? Sure , but not at some Chinese place .... with Dragon in the name ! ! AH HA HA HA ! ! HA HA HA ! ! HAHA HA ! I used to be Superman ! AHA HA HA ! HA HA!<br /><br />fade to black < br /><br />my god , it made me cringe it was so stupid.<br /><br />But never fear .. even though the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive .. for some reason there 's a second untouched , unmanned lab that survived pretty well , so they can make a sequel . Hurray for us all.<br /><br / >
0 This is a formula B science fiction movie , and the director made no bones about it . It is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team . Everything done is stuff you 've seen many times before . It is a weak script , with no real characters . In fact , it is full of stereotype characters and situations . The director attacks this by just making it a formula movie , with no attempt to fool us , and that gives this movie a mild appeal , but it is n't something you 're likely to remember a while . It is best seen while you 're cooking , cleaning , working out . Sort of mindless fun . It has its place in entertainment , but it certainly is n't something you sit down with friends to watch , unless you 're all just drunk and do n't care . The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair . I do n't think it is as crappy as most people , but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular . That really eludes me , as I see no attempt to even make this a memorable film .
0 I caught this movie on Sci - Fi before heading into work . If you 've any interest in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times , this movie is for you . If that does n't peak your interest , well , I 'm afraid you 'll wish that YOU were the one about to be enveloped in flames , because this movie is pretty bad . The acting , to begin with , is awful , awful , awful . The characters are all completely obnoxious , and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z - grade , Sci - Fi movie . Towards the end , the movie began to remind me of ' Hollow Man ' ( complete with escape via elevator shaft ) , except with a Dragon , not a naked , invisible man . Unlike other similar flicks , however , this one was n't even awesomely bad ... it was just plain bad .
0 Dragon Fighter is the first Sci - Fi Channel ( although I guess it 's now called Syfy ? ) original movie I have ever seen . But I have seen one or two others since , and I can tell you that they were stupid , but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel . The CGI is done poorly , the acting is bad , the script is ridiculous , and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place ( if you have seen Dragon Fighter , you probably know what I mean ; I did n't want to put a spoiler in my review ) . Plus , there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence . That was really stupid ; they just played it over and over . And it 's definitely not original ; I know I 've heard that somewhere before ( I just ca n't remember where ) . This is one to avoid .
0 The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable . The characters are believable and interesting . The cloning lab looks really high - tech . After that , it all collapses . The characters start behaving idiotically , and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor ( and this is supposedly " present day " ) going critical , the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it does n't . The finish is incredibly weak . One wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong.<br /><br />All the characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians . This results in some weird situations and details , like the character being played by Vessela Dimitrova being called " Bailey Kent " despite her heavy accent ( and despite her , on one occasion , inexplicably switching to * Spanish*!).<br /><br />Because of the decent start , I considered rating this movie a 5 , but it really was more disappointing than that , so I only give it 4 .
0 there are those movies that are bad they are funny , then there are those where you scream " i want that one and a half hours of my life back" ... thats pretty much what this is.<br /><br />dean cain tries to be an actor but fails . the sfx are really bad ( repeated scenes and rocks that look like falling paper ) and the fake plastic guns that have torches taped on them ... the split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just terrible.<br /><br />this movie ca nt even be used as one of those simple night entertainers , its just that bad < br /><br />if i could go negative ratings , i would
0 It 's hard to praise this film much . The CGI for the dragon was well done , but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow . Also , the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious.<br /><br />I was amazed to see " Marcus Aurelius " in the acting credits , wondering what an ex - Emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film ! Like " Whoopie Goldberg " it must be an alias , and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker.<br /><br />The story might been interesting , but the acting is flat , and direction is tedious . If you MUST watch this film , go around to your friend 's house and get drunk while doing so - then it 'll be enjoyable .
0 Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she 's ever seen ... Since I thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking - which film was the worst film I had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was a couple of years since I 've seen it but I remember the horribly miscast Dean Cain as cocky military man ( pretty boy Cain does n't do cocky very well ) . The strange deal with the CGI - helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some CGI - guys to make it , but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer 's son liked to play with his new computer . And how did it look ? ? Awful . And when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over - looks VERY cheap.<br /><br />Avoid this movie - it is truly awful ...
0 Pretty standard B - movie stuff . Seriously , anyone who watches " Dragon Fighter " with Dean Cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence . B movies exist to re - work formulas that are popular . If you give them even token analysis , you 'll wind up ruining the movie for yourself ( and perhaps writing some self - important , slanderous review on IMDb).<br /><br />I liked the female lead , Kristine Byers . She had charisma and I thought she was notably attractive . It was a memorable B - movie appearance . Unfortunately , I do n't see where she has made any movies since . I 'll watch for her again .
0 When you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member , you know you 're in for a bad ride.<br /><br />I went in with very , very low expectations , having read some of the other comments , and was not let down . Unlike some other cheap and failed movies , however , this one does n't really remain hilariously ( and unintentionally ) funny throughout.<br /><br />-SPOILERS FOLLOW-<br /><br />First of all , plot it very inconsistent . Looking past the " small " mistakes , such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours , the whole idea it 's based on is messed up . See , the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs . After explaining this , they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out . Later , the obligatory " crazy scientist " guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs . So apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were , or we just have a fine little plot hole here . The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force " half as strong " as what was used for Hiroshima . Then two guys later walk in to check everything out , and it 's almost unscathed ! There 's even another dragon , which grew out of who knows what . All in all it 's very predictable . As soon as the guy mentioned cloning , I guessed they 'd clone a dragon . That means that our Mr. Smarty - pants security guy is n't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe , if you ignore that I knew this film would be about , you know , dragons.<br /><br />Putting that aside , the second worst thing is the " special effects . " Others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning , the CG helicopter , and the dragon . It looks a bit better than a blob , but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time . To their credit , the flying dragons in the beginning looked OK from far away ( although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie . ) These things are funny to watch , however . The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not . Nor are the " introduction " screens with the vital stats.<br /><br />Coming to the actors , they were n't the greatest , but I guess at least they tried ? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent " BloodRayne , " for example , and you 've got to give them points for that . One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in make - up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her . She looked like she had a bad run - in with some white - face.<br /><br />The script is bad and cheesy . You do n't really notice the music , but it 's actually not too bad for the most part.<br /><br />The bottom line is do n't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it 's bad ( like I did ) , although the only funny things are the bad CG effects . Other than that , do n't waste your time and money .
0 What a dreadful movie ! For some reason , scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby , dirty , mean - spirited , misanthropes living inside . These folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects can not seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI Dragon . Spoilers : An extra - nasty scientist whose main acting skill is " leering " and " the sinister stare " has cloned a Dragon . While the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing , the other scientists are shocked , because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down . The rest of the story is like THE THING , or Ten Little Indians , where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and/or defeat the " Dragon . " The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray , which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects . It hardly looks better than a cartoon , and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon . All it looks like is a gray blob . The acting is less than horrible . These scientists act like a bunch of children who can not agree on anything , and this makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape , hide , etc . Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie . He seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast . This movie is really , really atrocious . The acting is bad . The story is dumb . The CGI is very very cheap and amateurish . There is nothing commendable about this movie , it is not even a good time - killer to glance at while doing chores or other work .
0 There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked . This was not one of them.<br /><br />It was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera . It was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking " that 's it ? " . Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable . This is one movie that would have wound up on MST3000 if it was still on .
0 This movie is some of the worst crap I have ever seen . I literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie . The CGI was awful , and the story was just a waste of ink . Dean Cain 's character was Mr - Super - Intuitive - I - can - figure - out - anything , except he ca n't seem to work his own helicopter correctly . The biggest problem was the split screen camera work . I felt like I was watching the Brady Bunch or something , only it was n't different people in the boxes , just close ups and different views of the same thing . I can only figure that the actors really needed the money , because this movie was n't worth the film it was shot on .
0 < br /><br />Once I ignored some of the implausibilities , this was actually a fairly decent horror / monster flick . So , I 'll give some of the good points first : - the dragon was quite convincing , especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch ( hint : she likes humans ) . - the action was fairly non stop , and , after a weak beginning , I got quite absorbed in the storyline . - sorry to say , I was kind of rooting for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie.<br /><br />Now for the implausible stuff * * maybe some spoilers * * : - if you were hunting a fire - breathing dragon in 1100 AD , would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm ? Duh . - a female character with an all - American name , blonde hair and obvious Slavic accent , trying to pretend she 's Spanish ? Huh ? - a lead scientist whose Slavic accent you can cut with a knife , and he 's supposedly born in Chicago , educated in USA ? - a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs , flies a huge transport copter with no other crew , and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot ? OK . Uh huh . I wo n't even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base.<br /><br />It 's still better than some of the Japanese monster flicks from the 60 's , but not by much . If we 're lucky , we wo n't see Dragon Fighter 2 , though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open . Or , maybe , they 'll hire a real director next time.<br /><br />In spite of everything , I gave this flick a 4 out of 10 . Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot , and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes . < grin >
0 If Alien , Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea , add a lot of sugar and you 'll get this one down . The film begins in jolly old England around 1100ad and then jumps to present day California . Our hero Carver ( Dean Cain ) is the new Security Chief and Military Advisor for a Science Lab 400 feet underground . He arrives ( Carver is also a helicopter pilot ) with the lead Scientist and we soon find out it 's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone . Is it a Dinosaur or what ? As with the above movies , all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off . The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a " direct to video " movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for . But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before . Again , do n't go in with high expectations and you 'll be ok .
0 Nothing could have saved this movie , not even Superman.<br /><br />Ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing . Better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors . But nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it . Plot holes , bad lines , terrible pacing , endless replaying of the same shots of a CGI dragon stomping through hallways ... ugh.<br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs.<br /><br / >
0 This movie really , i mean REALLY , sucks . Its got plot holes so big , and 30 foot dragon can fit through them . Not to mention the dragon itself , which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real . I mean , when you see something like this , you got ta be thinking " Wow , someone actually made this movie . Then released it . That takes guts " . Whoever they are , i 'm sure they do n't work in the film business anymore.<br /><br />When i hired this movie , it was n't in on DVD , so i ( reluctantly ) took it out on video . The first thing to appear , was a Lord of the Rings trailer , for the Two Towers . This was a very clever move , putting this trailer on the video . It justifies me ( reluctantly ) giving the film 1 star , otherwise i would have given it zero stars . Maybe the producers though the star attraction of Dean Cain ( I think that s how you spell it ) would draw in the crowds ( uh , to the video store that is).<br /><br />Next they employed split screen technique ( like in Hulk ) to ( i assume ) compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is . On the box cover , we see a picture of our hero , and the dragon . Does the dragon look exactly like the one in Dragonheart , or is it just me ? Either way , the dragon in the film looks like a reject from Gremlins 2 , and has the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain from the early 90 's ( perhaps worse ) . Also , not the Dragons movement as it pursues its victims- its the same F##cking monotonous movement- right leg , left leg , right leg left leg- dom , dom , dom , dom DOM , DOM F#$king DOOOOOM ! This just pisses me off . Maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of Jaws . Why not then have a Dragon POV shot . Either way , that was just funny , much like watching a Weebl toon.<br /><br />Dean Cain gives many puzzled looks during the film ( maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career ) . Do n't expect Superman here . The first time i saw the trailer for this film , i thought it was an add for a PS2 game.<br /><br />As for the story , its so so bad , my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he 's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i was n't there . Oh , and did i mention that I F@#KING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM ? ! ! !
0 OK .... I just have 3 words - cheesy , cheesy and CHEESY ! The only redeeming feature of this movie is Dean Cain . Other than that - it 's CHEESEBALL SUPREME!!!!<br /><br />The movie DOES have some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon - basically giving us more of " Jurassic Park " meets " Reign of Fire " ..... There are some great possibilities , but they just do n't follow through .... The special effects are decent - even though you KNOW the dragon is CGI , it does n't horribly LOOK like CGI .... < br /><br />I would n't lay the blame on Dean Cain ( although he IS one of the producers ) , I 'd lay more of the blame on Phillip Roth - the director and writer . It 's HIS job to make this film .... and , unfortunately , he failed .
0 When I am watching a film , I am aware that it is ` just a movie , ' but nonetheless I do like to allow myself to become engrossed as much as possible under the circumstances . I think this is what makes us cry , scream , laugh , or otherwise react emotionally as audience members , even though , deep down , we know it is ` just a movie . ' What I do n't want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that I am unable to slip into the aforementioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the film . This film 's director chose to frequently use multi - angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen . Maybe it is just me , but I find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating . They might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading , ` Attention : This is just a movie . Do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed ' . If I want ` picture - in - picture ' , I 'll activate it from my TV remote , but never during a movie I want to enjoy .
0 When I rented this I was hoping for what " Reign of Fire " did not deliver : a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.<br /><br />Instead I got a standard " monster hunts stupid people in remote building " flick , with bad script , bad music , bad effects , bad plot , bad acting . Bad , bad , bad.<br /><br />Only reason why I did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies . In theory .....
0 Saturday Night Live , National Lampoon , and SCTV alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film.<br /><br />However , it is very interesting to watch now , at the start of 2005 . Twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place , look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true : There is a mock movie trailer , that probably was n't even clever at the time , for something called " The Pregnant Man " which came true with Arnold Schwarzenegger 's dumb movie " Junior " There is a commercial spoof , that probably was n't even clever at the time , for something featuring Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called " Celebrity Wrestling " which has now come true with a popular show called " Celebrity Boxing " There is a mock movie trailer , that probably was n't even clever at the time , that features John Candy in a movie about a severed head . Watch this trailer and look how similar it 's shots and plot are to Frank Hellenlotter 's Basket Case ! ! And finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about " a dead dream , the only two left ... " The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES ! LOL.<br /><br />Four prophecies come true !
0 Stephen Feinberg , who Played the Proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie , passed away in early 2006 . I met Steve in Portland in 1993 , it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in Hollywood years earlier , working mostly on TV promos . He asked me not to see ' Tunnel Vision ' , but it was too late , I had seen it already ! Actually I had seen it years before , when it was released . At that time I did n't think it was that bad a movie . However seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different . Yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated . Steve admitted it was not a very good movie . That said he was just a little proud of ' The Proctologist ' sketch .
0 This is the worst movie I ever paid to see and with the exception of " They Saved Hitler 's Brain " the worst movie I have ever seen period . When this movie came out I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore was anticipating what I thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the TV improv shows must deal with . < br /><br />The writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness , some flatulence jokes , some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy . The game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on Let 's Make a Deal with stupid grossness . The sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor . The stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for Seasame Street . The LA subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness . The french chef walking around blind constantly uttering " there is no difference " with a french accent was , well you get my point.<br /><br />The only funny skit involved Chevy Chase which lasted for a whole minute . This means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie . Oh yea I 've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970 's and you will like this movie if you are high . Well most of the country was not stoned in the 70 's . If the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine . There were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when I saw this movie . Of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was .
0 In the future of 1985 , a governmental committee headed by Howard Hesseman , is holding hearings on TV 's first uncensored network . They sample it 's programming , that play as a series of skits . I can name the good ' skit ' movies on one hand , not using my thumb . " Amazon Women on the Moon " , " Kentucky Fried Movie " , " The Meaning of Life " , and " Mr. Mike 's Mondo Video " . Notice how I did n't mention " Tunnel Vision " ? The reason for that is that this ' movie ' is death in cinematic form . None of the skits are even remotely funny , or even the least bit clever . It takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers ' part to not even get one laugh out of me.<br /><br />My Grade : F < br /><br />Eye Candy : Dody Dorn goes full frontal
0 I missed the beginning but I did see most of it . A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room at FYE.<br /><br />The skits are all very short , and yet most of them are still too long . The majority of them , they seem to have forgotten to have something funny ! Quite a lot of racist / sexist/"homophobic " humor in it , skits based on stereotypes , or skits which use racist terms for people.<br /><br />I'm trying to remember anything I thought was funny in it , and I 'm having trouble .... The logo for the Tunnel Vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it . The mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids . Kind of creepy.<br /><br />What a disappointment . Most of the actors went on to better things , and it 's lucky this bomb did n't hold them back .
0 This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film . You 've got future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime , such as John Candy , Chevy Chase , Laraine Newman , Al Franken , Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse , uninspired fart and racist jokes . The concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes , but instead right out the gate , makes a lame , juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way . Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later , hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie . This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70 's sketch comedy movies .
0 Back in the 70 's , when I had first seen this , I was in high school . It was cool then . Now as an adult I look back at it and I say to myself .. yeah right . What was so funny ? It has it 's moments but they are few and far between . It is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up . Show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost . If you like this type of humor you may want to stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon . Tunnel Vision as well as Groove tube are too dated for today 's viewing .
0 This is a decent endeavor but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool . No , it is n't CGI bugs and software companies . Actually I 'm not sure whether it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles so I had to guess what they 're talking about . Anyway my point was - instead of wasting your time animating some dumb - ass bug , why not throw in more zombies and more action . 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins , bugs , some guys yelling about something . And to makes matters worse ( more boring ) most of the deaths occur off - screen . I realize that 's all too common for no - budget movies , but then there were some very impressive effects ( well , kind - a of ) which left me wondering why did the director ( or screenwriter , whatever ) chose to focus on how the epidemic started - it 's a short , nobody 's gon na care anyway .
0 I bought this DVD after seeing it highly ranked here . It 's just a short 20 minutes zombie film . Nothing special about it except for the music perhaps.<br /><br />Don't buy it ! Not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it . Only if you 're really bored ...
0 Steven Vasquez directed and co - wrote with James Townsend , the star , this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions : make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller . So why does n't it work ? For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film , dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters . Not that that is a bad thing : it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes . The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women , relationships , disturbed parenting , the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder . It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.<br /><br />Devon ( James Townsend ) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna ( Sarah Kelly ) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian ( Alex Wilson ) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level . They bond , Devon comes out , and the mysteries begin : boys are missing in the neighborhood , Devon 's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler ( Dan Swett ) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon 's consoling mother Donna ( Sonja Fisher ) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship . It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham ( Earl McDougle ) who apparently is investigating the missing boys ... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick . And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy , etc.<br /><br />Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye ( and there is very little the eye does n't examine frequently ! ) but the degree of acting is at an all time low . The only thing that makes us forgive that ( and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive ) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved . Yes , this is a low budget movie and yes , the director needs time to learn his trade . But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level . Maybe their next one will be more polished . Grady Harp
0 There are some good things about the movie . The music and cinematography is great . Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance . Ryan Bauer is also hot . The production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie . Jonny Vincent ( Sean ) and a lot of the boys in the movie that do n't speak are cute too . Why is n't the actress who plays Amy listed in the credits ? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink.<br /><br />The worse thing about the movie is probably the star , James Townsend . He ca n't act . He 's also very scrawny , not nice to look at at all . His arms are like spaghetti . It 's disgusting . They have no muscle tone at all . It 's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it . No one else would cast him in anything.<br /><br />James Townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay . They should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what 's best for the movie . Then again , maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft - core porn , definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons . Plus , anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood.<br /><br />The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan - skinned Latina as Devon 's mother . Sonja Fisher does not seem like an actress at all . All in all , this movie is soft - core porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax . I think even Alex Wilson , probably the best thing about this movie , is embarrassed by it and does n't want to be associated with it . There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed , so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name . Plus , I ran into him in West Hollywood one time recently and when I mentioned this movie , he just turned around and walked away . I understand . If I had worked on this movie , I would be embarrassed and would n't want to be associated with it either .
0 Until now , the worst movie I had ever seen was Ben & Arthur . You really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one . The review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it , evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online . At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs , instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is terrible , the script , the story , the casting , the acting , the direction , the photography , the editing , the music ... what else goes into a movie ? Whatever it is , here it 's as bad as it gets . If it were n't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous . I kept watching it thinking it must get better , because I had n't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable.<br /><br />It does not take a lot of money to make a great movie , nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad . My favorite example of a shoestring - budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant 's amazing Mala Noche , but there are many others . Sideline SecretsDirector 's Cut or originalis bad not because the people who made it had no money , but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except self - promotion .
0 The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline ... Otherwise , this movie was terrible . The acting was ridiculously bad , and the set design was cheesy and very tacky . The story was decent , but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting . I would n't recommend watching this one ... The only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer , the man who plays the soap opera star . Some of the editing was well done , but there are continuity errors all over the place ... I'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon ?
0 THIS FILM IS LAME , LAME , LAME ! ! ! ! ! It takes a lot to bring me to over - exaggeration about a movie , but this movie stunk up my house ! ! I have n't even finished the movie yet and I had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is . I'VE NEVER DONE THAT ! ! As a consumer , do not spend your money on this film . Wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something . It 's barely TV worthy . I REALLY HATE TRASHING A MOVIE , BUT THIS MOVIE IS TRASH ! Barely above porn . Should have and X rating ! Good plot , some frontal nudity ( if that floats your boat ) , but HORRIBLE high school level acting . Do n't know how this movie received distribution . ( Must have been a contractual thing . ) Really , if you really like watching good movies , do n't waste you time with this one . From one movie lover to another . YOU WILL BE MAD AT YOURSELF ! Let me say this as well , if you 've been through something like this perhaps you can relate and it will have some value for you . In that case I say watch it , you may take something away from it , if not just seeing something that 's happened to you being acted out by someone else ( has therapeutic value ) .
0 Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM , but it was a severe disappointment . Lupe Valdez is great , but does n't get enough screen time . Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters , but the script leaves them stranded.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the ego of Lee Tracy 's character , who is at best a self - centered , physically and verbally abusive jerk . The reactions of " the public " are poorly thought - out and unbelievable , making the " shenanigans " seem like contrivances of a bad writer . And it strains credulity that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him.<br /><br />The " stinging one - liners " mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer , since I did n't even notice that an attempt was being made .
0 If you 've ever wanted to see a film that stresses style over substance , this is for you . To me , Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE , but there 's precious little substance , unless mawkish , melodramatic , manipulative love yarns turn you on . This may be one of those famous ' chick flicks ' you 've heard so much about . < br /><br />We're about half - way through this film before anything really happens : Ulises ( Jordi Molla ) goes out to sea looking for tuna , and does n't come back , leaving his wife Martina ( Leonor Watling ) and son to fend for themselves . Then , in a furious six minutes of screen time , they bury Ulises , Martina gets married again , and her son grows into mid - childhood . This rapid transposition is jarring , to say the least , and very sloppy : after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around , we 're suddenly into a full - blown melodrama , all in six minutes . I think this is called wayward narrative pacing.<br /><br />Five years later , Ulises ( as in the wandering superhero Ulysses ; get it ? ) , returns to his ' Penelope ' ( Watling ) only to find she 's married to Sierra ( Eduard Fernandez ) , an inexplicably wealthy guy ( what does he DO to earn all that dough ? ) who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets . When Martina , in great anger , questions Ulises about his absence , he tells her that he 'll take her to the island of Sumatra someday and she 'll understand EVERYTHING.<br /><br />And here 's the thing : he DOESN'T take her to the island of Sumatra . The reference just dies somewhere in the script . He DOESN'T really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years . He DOESN'T acquit himself as an honourable guy , and the movie DOESN'T fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film . I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues ( fish , reptiles , the sea ) he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue . It just does n't work . The narrative ' arc ' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline.<br /><br />I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor , but I just could n't buy his Ulises as any kind of hero ( which is what the original Ulysses was supposed to be ) . With moist sensuality , he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from Virgil roughly 2,000 times and each and every time it excites Martina to explosive orgasm . This guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages . I 'm sure Virgil would be impressed . He did n't get laid that often , as I understand it . < br /><br />This poetic ' device ' figures prominently in the film , and I had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of Ulysses ' famous ' siren song ' ( i.e. beautiful maidens singing seductively to far - off sailors , who were doomed if they answered the , well , siren call ) . If this is what Bigas Luna is up to , you can see the problem -- he 's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch - and - grab attempt at High Art . Once again , it just does n't work , at least in my eyes.<br /><br />Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor , but she gives us a character here who does n't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth . It 's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for - rent sign on his face ( as in vacant ) , oily 1960s - style hair that looks more like seaweed , and one of those trendy 21st - century ' beards ' ( you know , four days ' growth , no more , no less ) . He 's SUPPOSED to be a dreamy kind of guy ( I think ) , but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script . < br /><br />But , do n't despair , this film is great to look at . Just do n't try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you 're hearing in the way of dialogue . You can do a lost of fast - forwarding on this film ( particularly in the first 40 minutes ) and you really wo n't miss much .
0 Ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town . There , he will fell in love to Martina , the most beautiful girl in town . They will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of Ulises at the sea . Some years later , Martina has married to Sierra , the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money . One day , the apparition of Ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences . The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part . IN addition , three quarters of the film are sexual acts , which , still being well filmed , are quite tiring , as we want to see More development of the story . It is just a bad Bigas Luna 's film , with lots of sex , no argument and stupid characters everywhere .
0 My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this . I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared , so I assume it was rejected , even though it met all the usual guidelines.<br /><br />I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes , particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà , a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as " Blow " and " The Alamo . " Leonor Watling is also quite good . Unfortunately , everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful , melodramatic script . There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art.<br /><br />An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere , anytime .
0 This Paramount version / ripoff of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE is n't all that unusual or innovative . The marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show . I do n't find the use of the background cyclorama , lit in various scenes with yellow , or pink , or red , or .... all that innovative . As noted , it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a TV budget : All soundstage , with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs ! ( Compare to NEW FACES ( OF 1952 ) . The actors come off reasonably well , though . And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959 . Of couorse , this movie suggests the often repeated question : " what were they thinking ? "
0 I will never forget the night I saw this movie . We were on a submarine on patrol in the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the evening . We ALL gave up after the second reel . They did not even try to show it at the mid - night showing . Opting for a rerun instead ...... This is all I really have to say but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines . I 'm not supposed to pad the comment with random words so I will just continue to ramble until I get my ten lines of BS . I could not find George Goble listed in the credits but I remember him in the movie . The sining was terrible and the songs even worse .
0 It was Jon Pertwee who said " It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is " Very easy " . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
0 If John Waters had written and directed " House of 1000 Corpses " after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object , the result would probably be something like " The Blood Shed . " It 's mildly entertaining for the first half hour , but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives , cutlery and pliers . Susan Adriensen ( Sno Cakes ) is incredibly annoying and Terry West ( Elvis Bullion ) is almost as bad in whatever it is he 's doing in front of the camera.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing about " The Blood Shed " is that it wo n't take most viewers very long to forget about it .
0 A female country singer nicknamed " Big T "-- seriously , that 's what they call her -- risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard ( Busey ) who wants to be her manager . His mother committed suicide , his father 's an alcoholic as well , and he has a violent temper . You can imagine where that leads . In the meantime , there 's music aplenty , as Parton , with her fluid vocal talents , belts out song after song ( at least half a dozen of them about Texas ) . Steer clear of this mess and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead .
0 The first point that calls the attention in " For Ever Mozart " is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb . The explanation is simple since there is no story , screenplay , plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie . Jean - Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films . I believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about ; but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie , and it is funny to read their reviews . < br /><br />My vote is one.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Para Sempre Mozart " ( " Forever Mozart " )
0 ... said a couple exiting the movie theater just as I was entering to watch this . Hmm , not a good sign , but who knows ? Different strokes for different folks , after all . Well , nope . They were being kind . Godard has released work that is passionate ( Contempt ) , entertaining ( Band of Outsiders ) , sometimes both ( My Life to Live ) . This is just dull intellectualism , that grates on the nerves pretty quickly . During my showing , literally half of the audience had walked out by the end of the film . If only I had been so wise .
0 this movie , i wo n't call it a " film , " was basically about nothing and functioned mostly for the popular acts of the time . yeah the war was on full swing ( pun intended ) , and this movie gave the troops and our audiences a treat.<br /><br />but let 's have something with a bit more substance.<br /><br />loved seeing a young Buddy Rich on the drums . the music was good throughout.<br /><br />but one cameo after another gets old fast.<br /><br />i did n't even recognize Zero Mostel ! so if you 're one from the " greatest generation , " as they say , you 'll definitely enjoy this ... <br /><br />movie .
0 Really , it 's nothing much . I only recommend watching it if ; 1 . ) You 're a big fan of any of the main stars . 2 . ) If you really want to check out the first time Lucille Ball was seen with red hair.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars
0 < br /><br />The main question I pose concerning this film is , how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs ! merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway , here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball . plot changes abound and the fun is lost.<br /><br />SKIP IT .
0 Following the release of Cube 2 : Hypercube ( 2003 ) , and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube ( 1998 ) , Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy , the prequel Cube Zero.<br /><br />Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution , time and place unknown , two low - ranking operators , Wynn ( Zachary Bennett ) and Dodd ( David Huband ) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers , some of which are rigged with death traps . Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection , these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn , a mathematical genius , discovers that one of the prisoners , a woman named Cassandra ( Stephanie Moore ) never agreed to be put inside the Cube . Suddenly it 's realized that perhaps their " jobs " are not what they seem , and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted ... <br /><br />For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube , this prequel will probably not be to your liking . It 's not that the story does not have potential ; it 's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on . Standing alone , it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message . It was also nicely self - contained . The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original , attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.<br /><br />What this new film has to offer , which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil , certainly are good questions to be raised , but probably should have been done so on their own merits , rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations.<br /><br />Having said this , the other traits of the film , such as acting and direction and writing , are not awful . There is a bleak , dark look to the film akin to such film noir as ' The Matrix ' and ' Dark City ' , and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube . Unfortunately for Barbarash , these are not enough positive qualities to save it .
0 The first Cube movie was an art movie . It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented , and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they could n't understand . It was , on the non - literal level , a " man vs. cruel nature " plot , where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end , triumphing to face a new , indefinable world beyond man 's petty squabbles ; a world where there were no more struggle , but peace . I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 , and it 's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.<br /><br />The second movie , Hypercube was a massive disappointment . Some of the ideas were kind of cool , but in the context of the original movie , both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning . Still , for being fairly entertaining , I rated it a 5 out of 10.<br /><br />The third movie , Cube Zero , while ignoring the second , plays like a vastly inferior commercial B - movie rehash of the first , sans the symbolism . There is no " homage " or " tribute " here ; there is only ripping off . The same kind of plot , with some elements idiotically altered ( like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip - off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say).<br /><br />That we see something from " behind the scenes " means nothing , because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment , the architects of which we hear nothing of . And , in this movie , those who get through to the exit ( like Kazan did at the end of the first movie ) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that ? ! That 's just flippin ' stupid . I 'm glad I did n't pay to see this.<br /><br />The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad , but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10 .
0 The plot does n't offer any new excitements , it even starts the same as cube I. This time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery , except for having an extra exit , which is not guarded , very ingenious . The characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode , they just became " flat " as in a soap opera . < br /><br />If somebody makes it to the normal exit , the person would be asked some questions , like " do you believe in god ? " , its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it does n't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps . Really there is nothing much else to say about it .
0 The screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life I 'll never get back ( where have I heard this before ) . The acting is so - so . Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen . Nevertheless there is n't a single original thing in this movie . While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie , which did n't make a whole lot of sense in the end , cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story , except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoon - feed explanations for every detail that the first movie did n't answer . The comic thing is , the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird , and tries to explain them . But the scenes are just copied over , there is no coherence whatsoever . This script is sooo pointless . I can imagine it being written by some half - wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project . The best part is in the end , they cripple the ' good ' wunderkind guy , and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie , and you see him when they find him ( ' this room is green .. ' ) in Cube 1997 . Goodie gooodie , clap clap , what a twist . First of all , what about if you have n't seen the first one , this does n't make any sense you nitwit director . Oh , another great idea : instead of the numbers to identify x , y , z coordinates of the room ( cube 1997 ) , this time it is 3 letters , each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values . Duh . Except now permutations do n't make much sense anymore .. so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them .. I want my money back.<br /><br />I guess I had to write this down since there are just so many bad , inconsistent , or just stupid ideas in this movie . Directors / writers should be required to possess some talent .
0 Follows the same path as most sequels . First one was great . Second was average and this one , full of bad acting and some stupid dialog and well as a lot of suspension of disbelief , this movie was weak.<br /><br />Too predictable and I just could n't stand that Henry Wrinkler - like boss with that stupid eye , there was so much more they could have done with this . I liked the first one a lot . I wish they would have went more down those lines , rather than what they did here.<br /><br />There was too much unexplained that needed to be explained , what time period this was in and why why why is there an old fashioned phone in that room?<br /><br />I understand there is another one in the works . < br /><br />Blah !
0 The original " Cube " is a fantastic B - movie rich with paranoia , meaty characterization , and fine over - the - top performances . It 's creepy , cryptic , and cool . And it stands perfectly well , on its own , without a stupid sequel like " Cube Zero . " < br /><br />This third ( ! ) film in the Cube series is part retread ( most of the booby traps are sadly recycled ) , part aberration . It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first movie - but , since said explanation is bland , I 'd rather it was kept a secret . There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube , but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political - religious totalitarian state . So , what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused.<br /><br />What works ? Basically nothing . The acting is purely amateur hour , the pacing is slow ( how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen ? ) , and the gore effects , while revolting , fail to convince . In short , " Cube Zero " reminded me of a " Cube " fan - fic , a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel .
0 This is pretty much a low - budget , made for TV , type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original . I 'm a fan of b - movies , and this one might have been good had they not attached the name " Cube " to it , because as is , the director and plot of the original were better , and this movie just about ruined my taste for the entire series . The characters are annoying and clichéd , there are problems with continuity , and several outright production screw - ups . The story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that . They more or less use the same horror gimmicks over and OVER throughout the movie , and because the first one was so good , this simply turns out as a disappointment.<br /><br />If this was a stand - alone b - movie , I 'd probably give it about a four . The " 1 " rating I give it was pretty much a statement about how it utterly paled in effects and intelligence as compared to the first .
0 Those familiar with the two previous Cube films pretty much know what they can expect : a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms , paranoia , bad acting ... This one is a bit different though . Roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube , where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube ( or at least five of them).<br /><br />I guess Cube Zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is , but you really do n't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films . Sure , there 's sort of an explanation in there , but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film.<br /><br />Cube Zero looks rather cheap ( as did its predecessors ) , and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling . I also fell pretty confident in saying that there 's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future . They have brought back the traps from Cube 1 , though , ( by that I mean that they 're almost the same ones , which is a bit of a shame).<br /><br />I know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one , but I just feel that it 's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was n't that great to begin with . [ 1/10 ]
0 The killings in this movie is n't that bad , but for sure the movie is . It 's even worse than that . It 's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your DVD - player.<br /><br />Not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the DVD - store , not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it . Horrible.<br /><br />It 's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie . It was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching , add to that the group pressure from my co - watchers.<br /><br />The manuscript is awful , the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable.<br /><br />I hope you do n't see this as a spoiling your fun , i 'd rather see it as a fair warning : Do not waste your time watching this garbage !
0 i think this one sucked on ice , because it left the cube , and gave us to much information as to the who 's and why 's . The original CUBE never left the cube , and it left everything to your imagination . This crap fest however , gives you it all . and i did n't like it ... Though the acting is solid , I think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the ORIGINAL filmmakers , if they had Vincenzo Natali do this prequel , or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source . so i recommend you stay far , far away from this one , and HYPERCUBE , another movie i do n't even want to discuss ... (i gave it a 2 for the acting only )
0 This movie was yet another waste of time ... Why oh why do I keep renting crap like this ? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well . back to the movie at hand : Cube Zero is probably worth it if you REALLY REALLY enjoyed the first movie , ( like I did ) , and just want to check out what 's up in the last ( hopefully ) movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed , then of course this is the movie for you . But if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot ... * evil grin * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK I 'm lying ... At best this movie sucks . OK , I have to admit that certain elements to it was cool .. well .. coolish ... and I laughed quite a few times , prolly at the wrong things , but nevertheless I was amused . :-) But all in all the few things that barely makes the " ok " category is n't enough to make this movie worth it at all .. Unless you count " Manos - Hand of Fate " one of the top ten movies EVER !
0 the only thing that frequently pops into my head while i 'm writing this review is , i'll never get that hour and a half back ! ! ! to indicate that i 'm not just blowing air , i 'll compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy(cube and hypercube)!cube was n't great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws!hypercube as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it beter than cube(the story was better ) ! but cube zero in comparison to it 's predecessors really is n't worth sh*t!a complete lack of good fx , a very f*ck*d up script and just plain old bad acting do n't combine well ! example : all of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if ... should happen and then it would happen , so it 's not very original neither ! my advice : do n't lose that hour and a half i lost ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I have ever seen , Mazes and Monsters felt like I wasted 101 minutes of my life . The only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious , but just ended up being funny since they were so bad . Evil Dead anyone ? Unfortunately for M&M ( fortunately for us ) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy . This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character , Robbie ( played by Hanks ) encountered throughout the film . It ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the D&D is the Devil movement in the 80s.<br /><br />If you want to avoid wasting your time and money , steer clear of this junk.<br /><br />P.S. - Even though the cover looks kinda interesting , which is why I guess my brother bought it , it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm , unless you consider New England or New York City to be such a place .
0 Many things become clear when watching this film : 1 ) the acting is terrible . Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so - so , but the parent - child conflict borders soap opera - ish . The other two boys : an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical I'm - a - babe - but - I'm - really - sensitive - inside blonde dreamboat ; 2 ) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing ; 3 ) Robbie 's dreams and episodes are disturbing ( acted by Tom Hanks ) ; 4 ) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice ( " we are all special friends " ) ; 5 ) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting ; and 5 ) this is a really bad movie . Expect to be disappointed -- and probably disturbed .
0 I caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college 's gaming club . We were forewarned that this would be the " reefer madness " of gaming , and this movie more than delivered.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Robbie , a young man re - starting his college career after " resting " for a semester . What we , the viewer , find out as the movie progresses , is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role - playing game called " Mazes and Monsters , " a game that he gets re - acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign.<br /><br />This movie is laughable on many , many levels . One scene features the group " gaming by candlelight , " which is probably the best way I can describe it . While I 'm sure that this was meant to be " cultish " in some way , as most gamers know , it 's horribly inaccurate . Most role - play sessions are done in well - lit rooms , usually over some chee - tohs and a can of soda.<br /><br />The acting , while not Oscar - caliber , is n't gut - wrenchingly awful either . This is one of Tom Hanks 's first roles , and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon . The supporting cast , while not very memorable , still hand forth decent performances.<br /><br />Mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made - for - TV movie that shows the " dangers of gaming " Worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night .
0 the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is . with a plot that makes your average middle - school writer look good , and acting which is almost as good , it gets my bottom score . one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously did n't have the pleasure to be real picky . the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume .
0 This film reminds me a lot of the anti - drug films of the 50 's and 60 's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about . Tom Hanks and his buddies are " role playing " , but there are no dice , lots of candles , and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing Hanks falling for the lady in the group . quite funny but misguided . I wonder how many poor kids had their D&D stuff destroyed , and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction . As a film it 's basically an after school special , bad acting ( although Hanks does show some of his talent ) and relationship talks , and no one seems to be having any fun . It seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism , which is more serious , apparently , and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does . Despite my vote of 2 , this is worth watching due to its unique genre , scare films , which I personally find quite funny .
0 I 'd completely forgotten about this film until now . This was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that I have ever seen . It 's message seemed to be : " Do n't teenagers use their imagination ; they might take games seriously , go mad and hurt people . " I can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that D&D style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship .
0 First off , I knew nothing about ' Mazes and Monster ' before I watched it . I had no knowledge of the Role - playing controversy behind it or the fact that it was a Made - For - TV movie . When I looked at the cover ( the updated DVD one ) I seriously thought it would be another Fantasy adventure like ' Legend ' , with Tom Hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters . Sounds exciting , right ? That is what the cover suggests to you at first glance . I was given this movie as a gift , obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows I 'm into action movies with a medieval myth theme . And it has Tom Hanks , one of my favorite actors . So I popped this movie in , expecting a feel good movie with Tom Hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laugh.<br /><br />No ! None of this happens . Now before I continue I will confess , I am a nerd but I have no interest in Role - playing games . That is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best . And M&M ( copyright infringement ? ) is not even a feel good role - playing based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness . No ! This is an Anti - Role - playing movie that must have been made by some Religious folk ( the same people who also think Barney is the work of Satan . ) I understand , Satan is a crafty fellow but I do n't think he is desperate enough for soul to lull RPG lovers into worship him . This movie is THEE anti - gamer movie . This is what I get from this movie : it hates RPGs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in Role - playing but it makes poor Tom Hanks a mental patient.<br /><br />Tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in ' Castaway ' , poor guy was alone but Tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the Volleyball as a lovable character through Tom 's good acting . I wish I watched that movie instead of this . In this movie , Tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature ( it looks like a poorly made mascot for a RPG team ) and has a split personality that is creepy at best . Tom 's acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else . I get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic . I am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to ' M&M ' made me feel like cr*p . Luckily I watched ' Hudson Hawk ' afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further . Yah , ' HH ' surpasses ' M&M ' by . . . a LOT ! This is not one of Tom 's better films . In fact it is thee most depressing movie I 've ever seen him in ( Even ' Saving Private Ryan ' is not this depressing ) . I walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and I ended up feeling the exact opposite . If you want to watch a sad ( both emotionally and visually ) movie then by all means watch this . If this movie is to convey a message , it is this : " Do n't play RPGs if you are Cuckoo for Coco - Puffs . "
0 If you did n't know better , you would believe the Christian moral majority in their preachy testimonial of the sins of the young , their questing for Satan , and that Hell was just brimming with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons fans.<br /><br />None of these items bears one grain of truth , folks . This work does nothing but give the Southern Baptists a chance to take a breath , while the movie continues to spout their erroneous and alarmist views concerning a creative and original gaming system.<br /><br />Tom Hanks contributes a stellar performance for this work , but even that was n't enough to save it . It 's crap . It 's beneath crap . It is ignorance breeding ignorance and as such , it rates NOTHING from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 This film sold for one - dollar at Wal - Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I lost anything for watching this film , except my TIME . Enjoyed the acting of Tom Hanks , ( Robbie Wheeling ) , who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script . The story is about college students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters , only in a very realistic setting . Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades . Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game , he stops making love to her and acts like a Monk . There are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former World Trade Center and also in the Observation floor and Roof area . It is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world . This is not a very good film , except for Tom Hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment .
0 The subject matter seems pretty dated today . Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe 's book ; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence . Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons ( based on Dungeons and Dragons ) . One player , a young Tom Hanks , enters the fantasy world too deep . His co - players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm.<br /><br />David Wallace , Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game 's foursome . Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton , Vera Miles , Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg.<br /><br />At this date , it seems lumbering and tame . But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his " Bosom Buddies " salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen . The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment .
0 This film is horrible . Bad acting , bad writing , bad music . It 's just horrible . Not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role - playing games , but the key elements of the film are poorly executed . May the God I do n't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination .
0 I have seen this movie many times , ( and recently read the book the movie is based on ) and every time I see it , I just want to slap all four of them . The fact that they do n't clue in to the fact that Tom Hank 's character is flipping into his D&D(oops M&M ) :) persona ( " Oh , he 's just acting in character . " ) outside of the gaming session . That and the fact that after three months of therapy , let 's just destroy all that and feed his delusions ! These kind of people are what give RPGs a bad name.<br /><br />Also the corny ' love ballad ' , and the music done by ' cat on a piano ' and ' stop us if we get too annoying ' are almost enough to set your teeth on edge !
0 Many people like to point to this TV movie when arguing with the vast legions of Hanks - philes out there that Tom did in fact make crappy films ( I think " Bachelor Party " was great , but that 's another story ) . The movie focuses on a " Dungeons and Dragons - style game " that eventually drives our young Gump to hallucinatory madness . The story is charmingly early 1980s , focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role - playing games.<br /><br />I , however , prefer to view " Mazes and Monsters " as the turning point in the " Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace ? " story . we all remember him as ' Rudy the Rabbit ' in " Meatballs " and as the hapless Clifford in " My Bodyguard " , where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of Matt Dillon . Few could argue ( especially those of us who read " Dynamite ! " on a regular basis ) that great things were in store for him.<br /><br />And then came Rona Jaffe . The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin , so I leave it to you to decide whose fault Makepeace 's performance in this is . All I know is that the last major release I saw him in was " Vamp " , and that was 1986 . He had a small role as Sean Penn 's brother in " Falcon and the Snowman " , but by that time the Brat Pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes.<br /><br />I ca n't in good conscience recommend this movie . Watch it if only to see a younger , more idealistic Chris Makepeace , before Rona Jaffe feasted on his soul .
0 I own this movie . Not by choice , I do . I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me . So i popped it in the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying " why God why ? " . The story - line was not that bad , as an gamer I could appreciate bits of it . I think that maybe if you 're into super geeky - cheese romantic scenes you 'll enjoy this film . " I always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know like Dr . Spock ... unable to love " There is very few good things to say about this film , truly it is awful . But if you 're up to really badly made film this is the one for you ! ! ! The real story 's much more interesting though ; ) < br /><br />If I had to sum up this film in one word it would be:<br /><br />LAME
0 This is the movie that epitomizes the D&D fear of the 80s ( and even today ) . The fear being that people who play D&D ( or any other role - playing game for that matter ) will be " sucked in " and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy ( and go on killing sprees , child sacrifices , suicide , etc ) . Great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects , but anyone who has played a role - playing game , a video game , or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence . It is to D&D what Wargames was to computers . Plus as a movie , it just kinda sucks .
0 One wonders how the script came to be written.<br /><br />Wayne and the other performers do an OK job but as it is neither comedy , romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.<br /><br />One feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile . It is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the USA became directly involved with the war . I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.<br /><br />Nonetheless it has historical value .
0 Lynn Hollister , a small - town lawyer , travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend Johnny . ( Yes , Lynn is a man despite the feminine - sounding Christian name . Were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that John Wayne 's birth name was " Marion " ? ) Hollister at first believes Johnny 's death to have been an accident , but soon realises that Johnny was murdered . Further investigations reveal a web of corruption , criminality and election rigging connected to Boss Cameron , the leading light in city 's political machine.<br /><br />That sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller , possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941 . It is n't . " A Man Betrayed " , despite its theme , is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama . Hollister falls in love with Cameron 's attractive daughter Sabra , and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements.<br /><br />This film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama . One reviewer states that John Wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer , but he could n't play a cowboy in every movie , and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass . Where I do agree with that reviewer is when he says that Wayne was no Cary Grant impersonator . Romantic comedy just was n't up his street . One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them , regardless of whether it was up their street or not , and as Wayne was one of the few major stars working for Republic Pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could.<br /><br />That said , not even Cary Grant himself could have made " A Man Betrayed " work as a comedy . That 's not a reflection on his comic talents ; it 's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film . I doubt if anyone , no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be , could find anything to laugh at in it . The film 's light - hearted tone does n't make it a successful comedy ; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else . This is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring . 3/10
0 There are people out there who will greenlight anything ! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists . And that 's only scary part to the whole movie . It 's so bad you 'll go off movies forever . I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing . I do n't know why I do these bad things to myself.<br /><br />As if it matters , here 's the basic jist of the ' story ' . A group of twenty - somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest ( Canada actually , because it 's cheap ) for the ' Rave of the Century ' ( which consists of about 8 people and un - raving music ) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $ 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry . That 's got ta be some rave to be worth all that dough ! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead ( hang on - I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead ? ) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />First faults here . Why would a tiny little rave ( of the Century my foot ! ) be held on some remote island ? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it ? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?<br /><br />Once they arrive they discover that the rave ( which consists of about 2 tents , a small stage and a port - a - john ) has been smashed , there 's blood everywhere and no one is around . What would any rationally thinking person do ? Run for their lives of course . But no , these clueless , obviously blind people decide to go look for them . Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that 's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside . Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows , as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters , and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again . The characters , like the movie , go nowhere.<br /><br />Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue , heinous acting , mumbo - jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once - popular arcade game of the same name . Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I 'll never know . The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further , if that is at all possible.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap , throwaway line at the end . It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory . Hell , even the Double Dragon movie seems multi - Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk . The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow . He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character . The rest of the cast suck I 'm afraid . The characters are idiots and deserve to die.<br /><br />Plus , if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity , I see no reason why this film can not be shown on Saturday morning TV . It 's not frightening in the slightest . Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film . And where did all those bad guys come from anyway ? There were only a few people on the island to begin with . I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over . I kid you not , you 'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.<br /><br />Who 's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid ? None other than director Uwe Boll . His control over the movie is non - existent . You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies are n't really taking it all seriously . The actors seem like they 're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card . It all feels very unnatural.<br /><br />Plus the film is shot like a two - part mini - series . I have indeed seen better TV productions . And do n't get me started on the editing . The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans . No real skill or talent was put into making this at all . It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero ca n't even get anyone to take his calls . House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be ' post - modern ' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.<br /><br />For what it 's worth , the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over - used ADR even more . The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself . Is n't this review warning enough ? Stay away ! You are all doomed I tell you ! Doomed ! Doomed ! ! !
0 There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one . Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood 's work , one look at that commentator from " Plan 9 from outer space " and you just KNOW you are not gon na see the next cinematic masterpiece . Just like that , when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece " House of Dead " , with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City , I knew I 'm in for a helluva ride.<br /><br />So , the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die . You know , to keep you wandering . Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like " Karma .. thinks she 's Foxy Brown " or " Alicia .. my ex .. we broke up recently .. I had to study and she had to fence " . No , I 'm not kidding.<br /><br />Anyway , this bunch of 20-somethings who could n't act their way out of a wet paper - bag are going to the " Rave of the century " , rave in question being a few tents , a port - a - potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific . Our gang missed the ferry , but thankfully will find a way to get there , the way being a fisher - boat ran by Kirk ( Cpt Kirk ? Get it ? Man , whoever wrote this script is a genius ) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons ' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.<br /><br />To make the long story short , the gang gets to the island , finds nobody there except some bloody T - shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there . No wait , they do not , they actually get all happy and like cos there 's free booze.<br /><br />With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill . Some guys in rubber suits start running around , there is some screaming and shooting , our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang , they go out of the house , meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman ( who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons ) and then decide to go back to the house . Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team , enter the Matrix , the rubber - suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this . To add insult to the injury , every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game - over cut - scene for a few characters when they die.<br /><br />I seriously hate this movie . It does n't even fit in that famed " So bad it 's good " category . It 's just plain bad . The script is bad , the zombies are awful , there is no tension , lines are bad , actors are bad .. the list just goes on.<br /><br />You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful . Do n't . There are bad movies that deserve to be watched . This is not one of them .
0 This is one of the worst films I 've seen . The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical . First off , there 's no plot . The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things . Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends . Also the zombies were terrible , no where near as fun as any of Romero 's work , who gets s plug in the movie . And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences . Like we do n't get the video game is about shooting zombies . Also , all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun . And the way the people die is so stupid . It 's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on . And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open , So dumb.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : If any of these actors appear in another film , then they 've been blessed with a second chance . Definitely the worst film I 've seen in years . A B - movie on cinemax is better .
0 Laid up and drugged out , as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract , with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi - oblivion , I happened to catch this movie on cable . I would n't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema , or rented it , or  heaven forfend !  that I watched it STRAIGHT.<br /><br />Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House , battling Chariot ( Type 27 ) , The Hanged Man ( Type 041 ) , and other impossible sentinels , my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.<br /><br />It doesn't.<br /><br />The banal plot revolves around a group of " crazy kids "  a la Scooby Doo  attending a remote island for a world - shaking " rave "  whatever that is . ( You kids today with your hula - hoops and your mini - skirts and your Pat Boone  ) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there ( a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric ) , they find the " rave " deserted.<br /><br />Passing mention is made of a " house "  presumably the titular House Of The Dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.<br /><br />A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler , showing the island in the throes of a  party ? ! Is that it ? Oh , so this " rave " thingy is just a " party " ? In the grand tradition of re - euphemizing " used cars " as " pre - owned " , or " shell shock " as " post - traumatic stress disorder " , the word " party " is now too square for you drug - addled , silicone - implanted , metrosexual jagoffs ? < br /><br />It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies . Intelligent thought stops here  < br /><br />I do n't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re - animation . Zombies ca n't die  they 're already UN - DEAD . They do not bleed , they know no pain . Unless their bodies are completely annihilated , they will continue being animated . At least , that 's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.<br /><br />Which means that a .45 shot into their " hearts " is not going to stop them , nor will a machete to the torso . And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood . At least in the video game 's logic , the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated , leaving a fetid mush that can not re - animate itself.<br /><br />Yet each actor - slash - model gets their Matrix - circular - camera moment , slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum . Seriously , these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from " Return Of The Jedi " , who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.<br /><br />I suppose the film 's writer , Mark Altman , having penned the not - too - shabby " Free Enterprise " , felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference , in the character of Jurgen Prochnow , who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung - swill . There is also a reference to Prochnow 's primo role in the magnificent " Das Boot " , when one of the untrained B - actors mentions that he " looks like a U - Boat Captain " . " . I wonder how many of this movie 's target audience of square - eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films , as when Prochnow declares , " Say hello to my little friend " , presaging his machine gun moment . < br /><br />Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video - game concept ( i.e. the game ends when you die  you can not win ) , this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart . Accordingly , everyone dies in due course , except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.<br /><br />A better use for this film 's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School , although Ona Grauer 's left breast did a good job , as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes : priceless ! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she 's been stabbed , but looking like she 's just eaten ice cream too fast.<br /><br />Attempting to do something more constructive with my time , I pulled out my Digitally - Restored , 35th Anniversary , Special Edition , Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of " Manos : The Hands Of Fate . " Ah , yes !  the drugs were suitably brain - numbing - now HERE was some quality film - making  < br /><br />(Movie Maniacs , visit : www.poffysmoviemania.com )
0 Ok , first of all , I am a huge zombie movie fan . I loved all of Romero 's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re - make of Dawn of the Dead . So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic . I mean , critics hated Resident Evil , and while it may not be a particularly great film , I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot - em up with a half decent plot . This however , is pure crap . Terrible dialogue , half - assed plot , and video game scenes inserted into the film . Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea . The only thing about this movie ( I use the term loosely ) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk ( Ugh ) . While his name throws originality out the window , you can see in his performance that he knows he 's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it . Everyone else acts as if they 're doing Shakespeare . And very badly I might add . Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a. ) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b. ) Like to play MST3 K , the home game . See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs.<br /><br / >
0 Okay , so I 'm not a big video game buff , but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from ? Sure , they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie , as though justifying any particular scene of violence , but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same , with the hand in the bottom on the screen , supposedly your own , holding whatever weapon and goo - ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.<br /><br />It 's an interesting premise in House of the Dead , with a lot of college kids ( LOADED college kids , as it were , kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $ 1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat ) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year . The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations . At least in this case , the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed . They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter - tops , but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.<br /><br />Clint Howard , tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far , delivers an absolutely awful performance , the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie . I ca n't stand it when well - known actors change their accents in movies , it is so rarely effective , and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well - known actor pretend that he 's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air . He did n't even rasp well . It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something . Real tough there , Clint ! I expected more from him , but then again , he did agree to a part in this mess.<br /><br />Once we get to the island , the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake . Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed . The nudity was impressive , I guess , but let 's consider something for a minute . These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year , find NO ONE , and say , well , who wants a beer ! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there did n't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight . Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There 's alcohol ! They wo n't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!<br /><br />So not only do they start drinking , not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island , but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is ( dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along ) , the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they 're alone . It 's like they expected to find the island empty , and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while , they would have some privacy since there 's no one else around . Brilliant!<br /><br />Now for the things that everyone hated , judging by the reviews that I 've read about the movie . Yes , intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie , mostly in order to show that , yes , the movie was being faithful to / directly copying the video game . Sure , it was a stupid idea . I ca n't imagine who thought up that little nugget , but worse than that is the Matrix - style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over . After the first time ( at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original ) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.<br /><br />One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans , who are much faster but getting tired , running out of places to run , and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with . The first two are done right in the movie , the kids are terrified and do n't have a lot of places to run since they 're on an island , but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler , they find themselves heavily armed . And I mean that very strongly . I mean , these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades , which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.<br /><br />Then you have what I call the techno - slasher scene . Since the rave never happened , and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie , there 's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead , and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video . There 's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it 's nothing but a blur of gory shot , mostly only about 5 frames long ( which is about 1/6 of a second ) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music . Clever , I guess , but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross - out effect because you ca n't see any one thing for long enough to react to it . You 're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil , mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it , and they 're exactly right . I appreciate that at least here , as was not the case in Resident Evil , it was n't some man - made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people , changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires . 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie , it 's just too bad that House of the Dead did n't do a single original thing , except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based , just in case you forget . I really think that this should have been a much better movie . While obviously I ca n't say that I know much about the game it 's based on , just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie , but unfortunately I think that 's more often the case than not with horror movies . It 's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no - holds - barred horror film , and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot , which suggests the possibility of a sequel .
0 I found this movie in the ' horror ' section of my video store . That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there . From Romero 's ' Dead ' trilogy to ' 28 days later . ' However upon watching it , you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory . There is no horror here folks . Just some half - way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling maybe you 're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes , but no , this is how they actually made the movie . It 's a pity . I think anyone could find a better use for $ 7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o ' crud . Though some of the 360 effects were cool , but once again , they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time , just with a different character.<br /><br />Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game . I 've played the game . It sucks . So why did they put it in here ? Oh that 's right , this is n't a movie but a music video , and it 's a poor one at that . 3/10<br /><br />Rated R : a lot of violence / gore , and profanity
0 Well , I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze . Why ? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is . It 's unbelievably bad . Just to let you in on how bad it is , I 'll offer this little detail about the movie . During scenes of mayhem , which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies , they intercut scenes from the video game . Yes , you heard me right . This movie really sucks . In fact , it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days . And to see corn filled crap like this ? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills . I 'm really disappointed with this , knowing that I watched it . OK , I 'm dumbstruck . It 's so bad I ca n't even find the words . RATING : ZERO out of * * * * * .
0 This is by far THE WORST movie i have ever watched . I 've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake , no , wait , i mean the the whole damn bakery . It is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created . Please just do yourself a favor , if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney , then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for . In summation , i guess you really can call it a horror movie , but only if you 're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.<br /><br />Real Rating , -10 Disgusting
0 This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who do n't understand what it was meant to be . One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously . It 's camp , along the same lines as " Army of Darkness . " AoD was silly , but funny and bad in a good way . " House of the Dead " fails to be " good bad.".<br /><br />There are qualities inherent in good campy movies , most important of those being believable fantasy . One needs to believe what 's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong . Without boundaries , the movie becomes absurd . HotD lacks any believability.<br /><br />Worse still , HotD brings nothing new to the genre , and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit . For example , all too often , horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction . I do n't know about you , but when I 'm being chased by zombies , I wanna make out with a hot chick . Believe it ? No ? Then , you probably wo n't believe it when the characters start sucking each other 's faces in this movie.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies , Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot , randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie . Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice , but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot . Further , there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting , and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors ' reactions to events ... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities . Avoid ...
0 This is the only film I 've seen that is made by Uwe Boll , I knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that " House of the Dead " is one of IMDb bottom 100 . But I still wanted to watch it because I 'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe 's the film have that makes it so bad . After watching it I do agree that it is crap , the movie had no story . In the first 15 - 20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about ( for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain - dead ? or the girls are ? ) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes . Is it supposed to be a comedy ? , or horror ? or both ? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it , which is a good thing ! The film is a true insult to the classic game , Uwe Boll please do not make any more films . Thank you !
0 I have watched some pretty poor films in the past , but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie . Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it , because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it.<br /><br />I am a fan of most genres and enjoy " shoot 'em up " games , but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable.<br /><br />As most have already said , there was hardly any script and the acting was weak . I wo n't waste my time describing it.<br /><br />Anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega , or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment.<br /><br />I must say , I was more annoyed with the video shop , who gave this a thumbs up , which led me to rent it . Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies.<br /><br />Comic book guy would be right if he said " Worst movie ever " !
0 You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that 's trying so hard to be a serious , thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably ? When you ca n't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen ? " House of the Dead " struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.<br /><br />From start to end " House of the Dead " manages to recreate the feeling like you 've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it 's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept . It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size ( which they exploit shamelessly ) whereas the males for their hardcore " kick - ass " attitude . I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture . Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie . At least then we 'll get better acting   However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film . It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as : " These are zombies , pure and simple " and " No cap'n , we must not go there ! It 's evil!".<br /><br />We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning ; at best they are a harmless two hours of action , blood and closet terror . Trash , yes , but entertaining trash . Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins . According to IMDb , " House of the Dead " received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie . If only we could have had the same privilege.<br /><br />Final Score : 1/10 .
0 WOW ! i did n't know that someone would make this movie ! its awful ! I have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie.<br /><br />number 1 : " its the biggest rave ever " where is the that rave ? i could only see a few people dancing around .. < br /><br />2 . when they are on the rave , they can ONLY see blood everywhere , no people , two ruined tents and one stage .. and what do they do ! ? they drink!<br /><br />3.the worst actors i have ever seen ! the captain and his crew .. awful ! < br /><br />4 . when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun , he shoots almost 30 times without reloading ! < br /><br />5 . i did n't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro ! must be a new thing .. <br /><br />i wonder what the producer was thinking ! " this is going to be a big hit , its gon na be a classic " .. sure u dumb s**t anyway do n't see this movie , its a waist of time . MY EYES ARE STILL BLEEDING !
0 F*ck Me ! I 've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss!<br /><br />Honestly I ca n't express in words how bad this film actually is . Besides the plot that is n't really there , the comically crap acting , the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies ; You know what , I could go on all day . Every little thing in this film is either stupid , pointless , crap or embarrassing . I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ... don't!<br /><br />I'm ashamed to say , I have this on my rack . It 's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile . I could n't even give this horse - sh*t excuse for a film away . That 's how bad it is .
0 If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10 , this would be it . ' House of the Dead ' redefines the term " bad movie " . Other bad movies , such as ' When A Stranger Calls ' or ' Premonition ' , will actually look much better when compared to ' House of the Dead ' . The basic " plot " of House of the Dead is a group of twenty - somethings travel to a remote island to attend the " rave of the century " . When they get there , they only find some tents , a bar , a stage , and some bloody t - shirts . They decide to stay anyway , and they are soon attacked by zombies.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie . It is not entertaining . Instead , it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is . The acting is unbelievably bad . In a DVD interview , one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll , the director , is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene . This is a blatant lie . The script appears to have been written by an 11-year - old , who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl 's chest and to include the hilarious line , " it smells like someone farted out here . " The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie . Somewhere along the way , the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies . It 's like they do n't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.<br /><br />The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing . There is something wrong with Uwe Boll . Boll 's camera work is astonishingly disjointed . His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing . Worse yet , Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie . Quite often , and at the most random times , you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot . It makes no sense . No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea . It 's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game . Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes , a la ' The Matrix ' . Unfortunately , he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating . The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind . Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track . This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious ' House of the Dead'.<br /><br />'House of the Dead ' is n't bad because it 's based on a video game . In fact , it has very little to do with the video game . It also does not fit into the category of ' so bad that it 's good ' . It does however fit into the category of ' so bad that it 's painful ' . This movie just plain sucks . Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set . Even his presence will curse a production . To all the directors out there : whenever one of your movies gets a bad review , all you have to do is remember that you did n't make ' House of the Dead ' and you will feel much better . I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back . To sum it up , words really can not describe just how bad this movie is . Everyone involved in the production of this film , especially Uwe Boll , should be ashamed of themselves . Although what I have said may make ' House of the Dead ' sound funny , it really is n't . Nothing about it is funny . Avoid this at all costs .
0 Just like everybody else have said , the acting is awful , no story or whatsoever , poor directing . About the SFX , the 360 degree , matrix style shooting , 1 shoot is stupid enough , but for each characters . I mean come on gimme a break . And what 's up with all those video game scenes , just to remind us it 's a " video game adaptation " ? Jesus , they should have fired whoever think up this idea.<br /><br />0.00001/10
0 I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies , but my GOD ! ! ! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen . Bad acting , bad effects , bad script , bad everything ! < br /><br />The plot follows a group of teen cliche 's on their way to a rave ( that takes place in broad daylight ) at a remote island . However , when the group arrives , all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes . Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party - goers , the clan set 's off on a mission through a zombie - infested forest . During this crusade , they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids . They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors . Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the " house of the dead . " This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence , redundant clips from the HOTD video game , and sloppy matrix - esque camera rotations . One of the character 's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others . Why ? Not because he was noble and brave , but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled ! I 'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />To sum it all up , there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is . The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen , and I 'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it . GRADE : F
0 Okay , let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who 's read the other comments . That being said , MY G - D , THIS MOVIE REEKED ! I mean , WOW , I did n't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie ! Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script ! The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said , ' Hey , Zombies are popular . Video games are popular . What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it ? Resident Evil ? No , someone else got there first . Silent Hill ? No , too silent . People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly . Hey , did n't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies ? They 're out of the platform biz , we could get that for pennies!'<br /><br />Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game , even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.<br /><br />The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid . I mean,<br /><br />bad - movie - merchandising - made - into - a - worse - game - in - two - weeks - and - then - shippe d - out - and - bought - by - morons - and - their - parents - for - christmas horrid . The graphics were boring . The monsters were boring . The levels were boring . The interface was boring . The CASE was boring . In other words , this was a boring game . And that was the ARCADE version . The home version was even worse ! With the home version , you did n't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game ! But I digress.<br /><br />The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes . HUH ? ? ? Did n't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on ? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game , which may explain the tedious use of Matrix - style effects . The problem with this is that the game was a first - person shooter ( the player proceeds from the POV of the character ) . Maybe that 's why they put in the game graphics , to let you know that they were alluding to the game ... Right , whatever ... <br /><br />Anyway , the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud , so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and did n't get me kicked out.<br /><br />To sum up , DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! Do n't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week . Run . Just run .
0 It is cheese . If all you want is a video game , complete with what look like straight - from - the - computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for , this is it . My friend and I actually had a great time seeing it , since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit . This movie REALLY requires heckling.<br /><br />Plot ? There was a plot ? OK , some stupid college or later types get invited to " the rave of the year " and go to one of the San Juan Islands ( " If they 'd only stayed back in Seattle , they would have survived . " - direct quote , or nearly . ) to attend . They get there and everyone is gone , and the site is somewhat wrecked ( but hey , the keg is still full ! ) . With the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman ( who acted only slightly less tough - and slightly less well - than Cynthia Rothrock ) , they fight lots of zombies ( some which spit acid ) , get an earful of freaky legends , and mostly get killed . That 's about it.<br /><br />It 's not quite as BAD as Demonicus , but not by much , and still better than Severed ( they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun to heckle , and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once ) . On the other hand , if you 're expecting a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil , run away ! ! ! run away now!!!<br /><br />OK , some real big questions ( without too many spoilers ) : Since when did Spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the Pacific Northwest ? ? ? ? ? Why is anyone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling guns , and to whom - CANADA , for crying out loud ? ? ? Why is a rave on an unnamed ( oh , excuse me , it 's called " isla del muerto " , shya , right ) San Juan Island - and outdoors , still keeping in mind this is THE PACIFIC NORTHWET . And the rave has about 30 people in attendance - " the rave of the year , " my patoot.<br /><br />Lucky thing there 's lots of hatchets around . Lots of them . Everyone has them . Must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby.<br /><br />Finally , while the movie started out playing with a little " parody " ( with nudges at I Know What You Did and Jaws ) , it did n't carry it through near enough.<br /><br />OK , really finally - when the introductory comments ( in a voice - over , no less ) casually mention that one of the characters " gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing " you can be darn sure there 'll be some fencing by the end of the movie . Not GOOD fencing , but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords , anyway .
0 The thing about calling " House of the Dead " the worst movie of all time is that it 's really not . There are worse movies out there . I watch alot of Hong Kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called " a movie." < br /><br />House of the Dead is however one of the worst films I 've ever seen at the theatres . Walking out half way through , I actually felt I was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garbage .
0 The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen , between the pathetic ' matrix ' 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting I fell asleep . I do n't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not , because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other . I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10 , ( 10 being the best , 1 being the worst ) . Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying , it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time . I beg anyone who reads this , NOT TO SEE IT . It 's not worth the time .
0 You know you 're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives . It all goes downhill from there . Unnecessary , " Matrix "- influenced bullet - time camera work . Pointless cuts to video game footage . Crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen . Ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye . Even the zombies are boring.<br /><br />I was hoping for at least a " so bad it 's good " zombie movie , but this one is " so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again".<br /><br / >
0 This is about the worst movie I have ever seen . This movie does match the quality of such movies as " THEY " & " Cabin Fever " , but even those had name actors where this one fell short . The " eye candy " of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift . ( just an example of the quality ) . I would have rated this movie in the negative if possible . Ladies I have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at , but not much either . If you were planning on going to see this movie I would strongly recommend saving your money .
0 I usually like zombie movies , but this one was just plain bad.<br /><br />The good parts : Girl swimming topless with thong bottoms , Sonya Salomaa 's topless , and Ona Grauer 's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran.<br /><br />The bad part : too much video cuts , too much Matrix slow motion ( it drags the action ) , not enough blood and guts , bad acting , and no story . The only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene . A total waste of $ 6 and time . I give it a 2 out of 10 .
0 I have never seen a worse movie.<br /><br />It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.<br /><br />Mistake 1 : absolutely no connection to any of the characters . In this movie you do n't bond with any of the characters because ... you do n't get a chance.<br /><br />The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand : Salish as played by Clint Howard . Except for this unique character , the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.<br /><br />Mistake 2 : the worst gunfight scene ever . I love gunfights . I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house . heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes . But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is " Apathetic " I 've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME . In this movie it looked and felt like the " Actors " were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.<br /><br />Why ? Where 's the trash talking ? where 's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire ? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad ... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.<br /><br />If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters , I recomend Sam Rami 's Evil Dead series . DO NOT see the disaster that is house of the dead . I hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie .
0 When I go to see a movie about zombie 's , I 'm not expecting oscar calibre performances , or writing on the level of The Godfather , but I do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards , and dialogue that does n't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera . This movie was just awful , I actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched Cold Creek Manor , that was n't very good either , but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of crap . On the plus side , the girls were very pretty , that 's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes , in fact I left after the hottest one got killed , there was n't anything to hold my interest after that .
0 What can I say ? I ignored the reviews and went to see it myself . Damn the reviews were so right . What a waste of money considering it 's budget.<br /><br />Good thing , I went to see Kill Bill after this one.<br /><br />To see a really scary movie , would be Crossroads!<br /><br />Bottom line-- I like " Girl in Gold Boots " better than this crap .
0 The question , when one sees a movie this bad , is not necessarily , " How did a movie this bad get made ? " or even , " Why did I see this awful in the first place ? " but , " What have I learned from this experience ? " Here 's what I learned:<br /><br />- Just because the " rules " of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years does n't mean someone wo n't go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them , without a shred of humor or irony.<br /><br />- If your movie has to be described as * * loosely * * based on the video game , you have script problems.<br /><br />- The black character may not always die first , but the Asian character does always know kung - fu.<br /><br />- While you may be proud that you figured out how to do the " the Matrix effect " on a budget , that does n't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea.<br /><br />- Being Ron Howard 's brother does not guarantee choice roles.<br /><br />- Whenever a scene does n't edit together , just use some footage from the video game , no one will notice.<br /><br />- If your cousin 's rap - metal band offers to write your movie 's theme for free , politely decline.<br /><br />- Zombie movies are not about people killing zombies . They 're about zombies killing people , preferably in the most gruesome way possible . That 's what makes them SCARY.<br /><br />- White people who can pay $ 1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.<br /><br />- If you find an old book , it will tell you everything you need to know . Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks , " What was that ? " or , " Where are we?" < br /><br />- Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.<br /><br />- A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from " student film " to " major studio release " . Try it!<br /><br />- Just because you can name - drop all three " Living Dead " movies , that does not make you George Romero . Or even Paul W. S. Anderson.<br /><br />I've seen worse movies , but only because I 've seen " Mortal Kombat : Annihilation . "
0 It gets really bad . The only half - way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film . There are context errors everywhere . The acting is horrible , save Kirk . The story is as holey as the grail , and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie , if it was n't already a corpse . So all in all it 's a waste of your life . I would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale .
0 Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for the greener pastures of Canada 's British Columbia . He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo . They stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory . Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracas.<br /><br />From 1945 until 1962 when he retired , Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns , some of them considered real classics . Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns . < br /><br />It 's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use . The story is downright silly at times . Williams who was along for the ride with Scott , he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time . He does n't blame the rustlers , he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm . < br /><br />Also there 's a scene in the film when Scott , Lee Tung Foo , and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians . They escape because Gabby 's mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the Indians allowing our heroes to escape . I 'm not sure that would have played in a Rogers film.<br /><br />Furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to find gold . < br /><br />This was Gabby Hayes 's farewell feature film part . It would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before this.<br /><br />I will say this , though no Caribou made any appearance in the film , this is one of the few Canadian locale films from the past that did NOT have any Mounties . < br /><br />But if I were you unless you are a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes , take the next detour off The Cariboo Trail .
0 " The Leap Years " is a movie adapted from an e - novella by Singapore writer Catherine Lim , which became the first Singapore novel / novella to be sold over the internet . The film had a tortuous post - production schedule : shot in early 2005 , it was slated for release at the end of 2005 , but only turn up eventually 3 years later , on the 29th February 2008 , a leap year.<br /><br />Before I say anything , I must first admit I 'm no fan of the romance genre , so I may be a little biased against this film - I watched it merely because it was a Singapore production , and that it 's available for borrowing at my neighborhood library . Here 's my two cents on the movie.<br /><br />Let 's just start by saying that other than Qi Yu - wu 's KS and Wong Li - Lin , everybody here of note seems to be a Eurasian . The love interest is a Eurasian ( Ananda Everingham ) , and Wong 's trio of buddies are all , er - hem , Eurasians . Does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with Eurasians are more " in " than the common Chinese ( or whatever Asian race you are ? ) I do n't know , it sure seems that way . Also , everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical " anglified " accent which does n't exist anywhere , certainly not in Singapore . It 's the kind of " semi - perfect English " that authorities would like us speak , but which does n't exist anywhere outside , say , the MTV Channel . The effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted , not helped by the lack of true - blue Singaporeans in the cast.<br /><br />The scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one - liners after one - liners . After twenty minutes , the " wit " of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichés . < br /><br />I guess I did n't enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable . < br /><br />There are other incredulities in the film . I ca n't for one believe that KS ( played by Qi Yu - wu ) would fall for one of Wong 's girlfriends . And the scene where the bridegroom says , " Go , before I change my mind , " has been used in a hundred East Asian ( Korean , Chinese , Hong Kong , Taiwanese etc ) TV serials ... <br /><br />So 4 stars for this film . The production value is fair , and Wong Li - lin tries her best , but she 's not helped by the script . Joan Chen has a 15-minute bit - part in the movie as the older Wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot , but , hey , her role is just cameo.<br /><br />If you come across " The Leap Years " in the rental or library , you may want to pop it in the DVD player for curiosity 's sake , but otherwise , for people who do n't exactly enjoy the romance genre , you can decide whether or not to give it a miss .
0 Recherche is a good word to describe this movie.<br /><br />Let 's say every movie has a selling point , a gimmick . Transformers ' gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia . Sleepless in Seattle 's gimmick is situational in their tag - line , " What if someone you never met , someone you never saw , someone you never knew was the only someone for you ? " Many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names . Leap Years employs both by using the Irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country.<br /><br />So now that the audience are in the cinema , besides all the usual elements in characters , conflict or consequences , crisis , resolve and denouement , they also look forward to stimulating dialog , more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years , interesting sub - plots and perhaps , to a certain extent , a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters.<br /><br />This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve . If they 've tried to , their goal was apparently in the other court , at the other stadium , on the other end of the planet . She and her writer , Alain Layrac , utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog . Most of the lines were contrived . It seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie : " Okay , these are the lines and quotes which I 've heard or read from either movies I 've seen or books I 've read before and they all sound good to me . If they sound good to me , they will sound good to the audience . Therefore , all i have to do is piece them all together . I am going to use all of them . " The result is cathartic . I ca n't say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on , but they seem to spring out of nowhere , catching you off guard with these quotable quotes.<br /><br />On a personal level , i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog , trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along . I do n't go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming.<br /><br />Secondly , the characters portrayed are silly and one - dimensional . With exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation ( necessary to drive the plot ) , there was no sense of conviction in them . I have n't an idea who they are . They are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female - oriented magazine.<br /><br />The gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow . Then again , there are movies with less but fared better than this , are n't there . They made it up with my first and second point . Moreover , the sub - plots are inconsequential ( not that it 's a bad thing for movies ) and thin ( bad thing).<br /><br />Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography . This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography , soundtrack and filming location . These non - discerning viewers.<br /><br />It is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it 's good . It is just bad . Do n't watch this .
0 There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie 's trailer . I am trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local movies , but I ca n't help but support the backlash against this movie . It is slow , boring and bordering on pointless . Even the " almost nice and believable moments " were immediately undercut by painful clichés and bad acting . Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin , whom I usually love , were only passable in this movie . It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV Soap , then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen . The Leap Years should come with an RA rating ( Rated Awful ) but it has n't changed my faith in local movies . More good films will come , so long as more films like these do n't get made .
0 I must preface this by saying I am a huge romantic . Hence I really wanted to like this film . So I 'm writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching it . The Leap Years tells the destiny - filled tale of Li - Ann who falls for the suave Jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year . A very romantic premise , based on a great short story and with a cast that does n't feel like you 're watching yet another Jack Neo flick . Then why oh why is it so bad ? Firstly , I feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video , because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages , predictable actions and clichéd lines . I am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in Singapore to watch The Leap Years , but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groans at the cringe - worthy performances spoke volumes . My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever , the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far , and The Leap Years does not even come close . Some blogs have called it The Crap Years which is harsh but ultimately true . Do n't waste your money or your emotions like I did . The movie will make you give up on love forever .
0 The Leap Years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene . And yet , they can not save this movie . It has so many things going against it - over acting , overly melodramatic , poor script , inconsistent direction ; and too few things going for it - decent music , good cinematography . This comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad . Please do not judge the rest based on this one film . This is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film . My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film .
0 The only reason that this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options . With a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup , horrific acting , and special effects that look like they came out of the " Thunderbirds " TV series , it is amazing that Widmark did n't kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume . Even by 1950 's standards , the special effects are atrocious , except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences . I can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because , except for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and THEM ! , there was n't anybody else doing effects . It was certainly no contest for Disney that year if this was their only competition . I would n't recommend the film , even for hard core submarine movie buffs , as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater can be seen dribbling down the up - raised periscope . There are other , much better , sub films that you can enjoy from this era , like the aforementioned 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run .
0 ... well , pop this into the DVD , waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back , and find out.<br /><br />Acting ? What acting ? < br /><br />Production values ? ... Production ? ... Values?<br /><br />Story ? Do n't get me started.<br /><br />After many years of posting on IMDb , I never thought I would see a film so bad that I truly wished for a lower rating than one . I always have found at least a reason or two to see merit - if only in the intent or the effort of the writer , the director , the cast , or the producer?<br /><br />In this case , they 're all the same guy ( ! ) who really needs to get a handle on the fact , at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape , that he has no talent . I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler 's " production " for his first cinema class , but the referenced " artist " behind this dreck was twenty - six at the time of this miscarriage . < br /><br />Just how did this ever get made ? Who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this ? Moreover , do n't let the box cover fool you : there 's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good " exposure " of the hunk on that cover.<br /><br />Two final items : there was one second when this " film " had redeeming value : the aforementioned " talent " gets roundly punched out by his lover . I cheered ! And , I did learn one thing from this " film . " . There are times when something is so very bad that it is , indeed , truly very funny . But not in any comical manner ; it 's just sadly humorous . Very sadly humorous .
0 This movie was laughably bad . A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch it . There are so many gaffes and goofs that it 's impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot . How about these for example ... <br /><br />The " Vermont Airport " surrounded by palm trees < br /><br />Ben 's miraculously appearing shirt during a phone conversation < br /><br />The priest 's palatial office ... complete with a folding card table desk < br /><br />There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie . But even if you look past the technical flaws , you 'll find horrid acting and casting . I was most tickled by the casting of a flamboyantly gay actor to play the right - wing religious zealot brother . His opening scene , sitting in his immaculate apartment , stroking his kitty cat , was hilarious.<br /><br />I applaud the writer / director / producer / editor / star / caterer / cast dentist / composer ( and whatever else he did on this move ) for actually getting a movie like this distributed . If you have nothing better to do , it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but do n't rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage .
0 If an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts , and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts , it wo n't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex . The kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist.<br /><br />Others have given this thing the dishing it deserves . For me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from LA was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be LAX ; and the return was signified by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane .
0 Oh my GOD . I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the ... whole ... thing . . . Okay , it 's going to be alright ... I'l know I 'll be okay in a month or two . Some time soon I hope to be rid of the flash backs . I was going to eat something after the movie but I just ca n't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment . Bad ? Yes bad . Very BAD . BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD . Wait , bad does n't seem to get the message across in quite the right way . Hmm ... There is n't a word to describe just how awful .... not awful ... Hmm disgustingly horribly casted / acted / filmed / directed / written . Now I do n't know what to do but throw it out . Possibly burn it I would n't want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now . The worst movie ever since " Hey Happy "
0 Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video , not film . The story is convoluted , and the production is amazingly sloppy . Note , for example , that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in Vermont , where they 've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony , the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees . Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants , including palms , which would n't last five minutes in the New England climate . On yet another airplane trip , the establishing shot depicts a FedEx cargo plane taking off . Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage . As for the plot , this movie expects you to believe that Victor , the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur , is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay . Not only that , but the pastor eventually sets Victor up with a hit man to have Ben and Arthur killed " to purge their souls of sin . " Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments . Were it not for Jamie Brett Gabel , who is surprisingly effective as Arthur , this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all .
0 Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10 . Sam Mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie . Sam should have given his idea to a good writer , director , and left the acting to somebody who could act . this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production . there was nobody to tell him , " Sam this is bad , really bad".<br /><br />Jamie Brett Gabel 's acting was the only good point , but he could have been so much better with a good director , and better actors to work with . < br /><br />This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie ( twice ) . the acting and direction was so bad , this movie was turned into a comedy . you just had to laugh , and in the wrong places . < br /><br />A second good point .... this would make a great date movie . after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date !
0 This film was the worst film I have ever viewed . It was like a " homework assignment " for a film class . It totally misses the mark when it comes to the " message " it is TRYING to relay . Characters are over exaggerated , poor acting and as for a plot ... well it is utterly ridiculous . The cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film , the co - actor is handsome and that 's about it . Moral of this movie : NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT 'S COVER ! Save your time , money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than I. It was painful to watch and quite frankly I am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it !
0 THE . WORST . FILM . EVER . MADE.<br /><br />After watching this supposedly gay made film , I suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo - nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever , all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture . I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so I had someone to scoff at when I paused the movie out of shock , disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity.<br /><br />On top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot , its just a poorly made film . A dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better.<br /><br />Seriously , after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here , I suspect the writer must have a half a dozen IMDb accounts . Anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke , is a liar or being paid heavily to say so .
0 I have never posted a review before , but I had to do it for this film ! This film is SO bad , I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody . But it ISN'T. It is truly , un - self - consciously BAD . This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously . Other reviewers have pointed out the film 's many flaws , so I 'll try not to repeat these , but I do urge you to see this film . Throughout it I was either speechless , literally gasping with disbelief , or rolling on the floor in hysterics . I have n't had so much fun watching a film in years . In fact , I 'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it 's the kind of movie that needs to be shared.<br /><br />My favorite parts : -- When Arthur auditions to be a go - go boy ( his dancing is unbelievable ) -- The gratuitous nudity ( the director / leading actor just had to get a nude shot in ) -- The preacher 's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of Christ -- Of course , the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings ( what narrative function does this play ? ! ? ) -- The ex - wife 's wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun -- The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher ; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match -- Yes , the gay religious - fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions -- And , my favorite , the use of Joplin 's " The Entertainer " as the opening soundtrack and " Pachebel 's Canon in D Major " as the closing soundtrack ! -- the list goes on and on -- a MUST SEE ! ! !
0 Intrigued by the synopsis ( every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover ; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign ) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it . This is my second ( and I assure you it will be my last ) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video . As far as I am concerned , this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip - off . I do not make this observation lightly  I am a major collector of videos , gay and mainstream , and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life . Period . My collection boasts over 1,600 films ( 93 % on them on DVD ) and of those , well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed . I hardly own every gay movie ever made , but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released , and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film . Sometimes , this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar , It 's In The Water , Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally . So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right , one of my favorite subjects , I decided to take the plunge sight unseen , despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title , VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS . That film was pretty bad , but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR , it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND . So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR ? Plenty ! To begin with , the " plot " such as it was , was totally ridiculous . This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay , but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls ( like this even makes sense ) . The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all , and several plot points reflect no logic , follow - up or connection to the story . Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides , and the acting is so bad that it 's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired . The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot ; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting . This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever , and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves . The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase , VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS , is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue . Hardly a distinction , since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is . It is an embarrassment to Queer culture , and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it . At $ 9.95 this film would have been way overpriced ; I understand that it 's soon to be re - priced under $ 20 , which is STILL highway robbery . I paid the original price of $ 29.95 , and I never felt more cheated in my life . The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  I have seen " user reviews " for this film on numerous websites , and there is always one or two that " praise " the director / writer / actor in such a way that it 's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe . How sad . How desperate . I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero . If ever a film deserved it , this is it .
0 Holy crap this movie was bad . I watched it just as a joke . It is n't even so bad that it 's good in an unintentional way . This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry . It worked really well at doing that . It 's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST , added in a bunch of ugly dudes , took out anything interesting , funny , or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction , and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese . That 's all this is . Cheese . There is n't a single person this film could possibly connect to . There is n't any universe this film could possibly take place in . Why ca n't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy ? Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is ? Why could n't they at least even tried to make it an okay film , or even a B - movie . Now that I think of it , what they hell were they trying to do with this film ? I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all ! ! ! No , I 'm not joking . That 's what it 's about . Does that sound good ? This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion , with it 's stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed , rude , and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible . A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks . The film , however , is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well . These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game . It 's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I was n't able to fully pay attention to this film . The makers of this train - wreck had no strategy for set design , acting , camera angles , lighting , script , authenticity , or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting . There is n't even a single sex scene , or at least not a believable one . Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all , but his good looks were sadly put to waste . This is trash . In a perfect world , this film would get voted a 0.0 . It 's worth 0 as a film alone . A mentally handicapped nun who is blind , deaf , and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write , direct , and produce a better film , and she 'd probably be a better actor as well . the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word " film " itself . This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format . I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x - mas tree and then record that and I 've already made a film that will always be better than BEN & ARTHUR by at least half . There are only two things worse than death . Torture and watching BEN & ARTHUR . I 'm a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me , and I do n't think I 've ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone . If this movie was a mistake , I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase " It 's okay to make mistakes " to " It 's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN & ARTHUR . " You know how people always say things like , " Good things come out of everything ! " ? I think that BEN & ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of . To call this movie the worst movie I 've ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit . It 's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it 's very own . There are good movies , there are bad movies , and then there 's BEN & ARTHUR . This is BEN AND ARTHUR .
0 I made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago . God I 'm still trying to recover . This movie does not even deserve a 1.4 average . IMDb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one . A 1.4 is TOO HIGH.<br /><br />I had heard how awful this movie was , but I really did not think a movie could actually be that bad , especially in this day and era . I figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s . My god was I wrong . Trust me folks , this movie REALLY IS THAT BAD . It is beyond horrible ; it is beyond pathetic ; it is beyond any type of word that I can think of for it . BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie . SNAKE ISLAND ( which up until now was the worst movie I 'd ever seen ) looks like it deserves a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort.<br /><br />I seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a Hollywood movie . This has no business being called a movie . In the first 25 seconds of the film , I seriously thought I was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie . Or better yet , I thought it was some Saturday night Live ripoff skit of the real thing . I mean , it looks exactly like that . The acting is horrible ; the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old VHS video camera . the special effects ....... well good lord Bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie . The scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy . I mean seriously , my Intro to Acting class from 4 years ago in college , all of us could have put together a better movie than this . And the worst part of the entire movie , where Arthur is naked in the bathroom . Oh my god I almost thew up right there . I have a strong stomach , but wow that was horrible . Some people should never be naked , and he 's one of them . The plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere . They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again ; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again ; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he 's running a porn shop . Everything about the movie is just horrible.<br /><br />This really does n't have much to do with my critique , but just so everyone knows , I am not a gay man . I DO however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals . And I would support any gay person in my church , unlike the cruel priest in this movie , who by the way seems to cuss every other word . ( WHERE IS THE F*(#*ing white out ? ) hahaha But I did n't want anyone to think I hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys . It has nothing to do with that : This would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur.<br /><br />I just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say . And yes it was even WORSE than I had read . Let this be a warning to everyone : ONLY watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be . If you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment , I have no sympathy for you whatsoever.<br /><br />On a final thought : How in the world are there 7 movies ranked BELOW this on IMDb ? There is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this !
0 There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent . Nobody in it has ever tried acting before , even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they 've been glued in place . Nothing looks rehearsed . The film quality is terrible . Most of the ' action ' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought , swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between ' actors ' as they deliver their lines . No tripod and no proper microphone either , there sound quality is terrible . Even ' Manos ' fares better than this , at least they had proper equipment . What plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess.<br /><br />Stick to home videos , preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy 's new camera phone . You will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this .
0 I was looking on Imdbs bottom 100 because i thought i d never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or Roller Ball remake , I was wrong . Ben and Arthur has beaten both.<br /><br />This out of the many countless amount of movies I 've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw . Bad Directing , Bad Characters , Horrible Acting , Horrible story There 's a reason nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film . Sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow Ed Wood.<br /><br />The Director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves - to be continued stars .
0 I have no idea what on earth , or beyond , could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake . Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made . In fact , I see no reason why it should not be at # 1 on the Bottom 100 . For although I have not seen , for example , SuperBabies : Baby Geniuses 2 ( # 5 at the time of this publication ) , I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound , because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made . By contrast , everything , and I do mean everything , in this film is completely unprofessional.<br /><br />The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right 's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays . And I do emphasize " intended . " Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose , it also leaves an ugly scar . Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple 's struggle against a society that largely opposes them , it creates tired , crass stereotypes of each party involved . Ben and Arthur , the namesake couple , are portrayed as two crude , sex - starved , and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so . This meets with the opposition of Ben 's brother Victor , a Christian minister who , like all Christians ( as this movie would have us believe ) , is loud , prying , stupid , and violent . He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry . Just like in real life . And if you think that 's dreadful ( it is ) , you have n't seen it all.<br /><br />The actors ( ? ) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video . But not even Daniel Day - Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker , for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh - inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie . Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote . For example , in one scene , Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother 's homosexuality . But instead of portraying this idea clearly , he spits out the stupid , utterly confusing , whiny - sounding line , " You know what , I 'm never going to have any nieces or nephews , okay , because you 're so F***ED UP!" < br /><br />Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values . Yes , I know this ai n't The Dark Knight , but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing . For example , six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds . People do not teleport across a room between takes . And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot ! < br /><br />Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur . I do n't care if you 're 7 , 17 , or 107 . I do n't care if you 're gay , straight , bi , or undecided . I do n't care if you 're " just curious . " I do n't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung - heap . Stay away , far away . This movie 's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee .
0 Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again . If he does he should be arrested on the spot ... at the very least for petty larceny . Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated . This was innocently my first viewing of his " work" ... and it will my last . Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.<br /><br />When I return this piece of crap to the video store , I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf . An active supporter of gay cinema , I am incensed and angered that this warped , exceedingly untalented man - child be allowed to distribute and package something like this , with a coltish pretty boy on the cover ( Jamie Brett Gabel , who , thankfully , has no other acting credits in IMDb ) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait , and then market it as a " movie " rental . Trust me , this has no place being on any rack anywhere ; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word . Offensive , irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema ( hell , gay rights in general ! ) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover , you WILL be disappointed . Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover , and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that 's it . Instead , the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting , sorry - looking dough - boy nakedness.<br /><br />This " thing " he " assembled " is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich . Both he and his friend Michael Habousch ( who , I understand , puts out similar sleazy garbage ) are terrible in this . Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no - talent ( in all fields ) , desperate to grab onto any " loser " attention he can for himself . He is to be pitied .
0 Let me first state that I enjoy watching " bad " movies . It 's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones . This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way . This vehicle for Sam Mraovich 's delusional ego does n't just border on talentless ineptitude , it has redefined the very meaning of the words . This should forever be the barometer for bad movies . Sort of the Mendoza line for film . Mr. Mraovich writes , directs , and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben " dead behind the eyes " Sheets struggle for marital equality . As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married . Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes . The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham - fisted , trademark Mraovich , that you ca n't possibly take any of them seriously . Arthur 's brother Victor , the bible toting Jesus freak , is so horribly over - the - top evil / effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role . That 's because Sam " multitasking " Mraovich was also casting director . The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself . When you think leading man do the words pasty , balding , and chubby come to mind ? Sam also delivers lines like domino 's pizza , cold and usually wrong . The final tally : you suck at writing , directing , acting and casting . That 's the Ed Wood quadruple crown . Congratulations you horrible little man .
0 This movie is just truly awful , the eye - candy that plays Ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie.<br /><br />The writer / director / producer / lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage , family acceptance , religion , homophobia , hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times , but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes.<br /><br />The script is poor , the casting very ordinary , but the dialogue and acting is just woeful . The homo - hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors ( I think I 've seen more passion in an corn flakes ad ) . The acting is stiff , and the dialogue forced ( a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight).<br /><br />I'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution , and if he is thinking of doing so , I have some advise - JUST DON'T DO IT .
0 as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best.<br /><br />The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont ? Pines yes - palms no . And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees.<br /><br />When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express . Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate ? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur.<br /><br />The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo . The two should have switched roles.<br /><br />The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible.<br /><br />Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
0 Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself . Seriously , even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is , although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen ! Never bothered to post a comment on here before , but this piece of crap really warrants it . < br /><br />Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical . Brother of the lead character ( either Ben or Arthur , I forget which is which , and frankly it 's never very clear ) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians , but apparently mass murder is n't . Then there 's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple 's ex - wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint . This leads to nothing , but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole " film " - " I do n't make sense ? You do n't make sense ! That 's who makes sense ! " . Brilliant.<br /><br />Then there 's the acting , which is just atrocious . It must be seen to be believed . My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman , who is clearly reading her lines off of something , yet still managing to mess them up . Enough said . The gay couple could n't be less convincing . There 's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy , and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts . Only fatter . And less talented . < br /><br />The " film " has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still , and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing . The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on . Yep.<br /><br />But anyways , we all know how terrible this thing is , so I 'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the " film " provides . < br /><br />- When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape . Hilarious.<br /><br />- Mildread ! No idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her , sometimes they do n't , but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless . Hilarious.<br /><br />- The stoned lawyer . Already mentioned her , but she 's so funny she 's worth another mention.<br /><br />- The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests.<br /><br />- The evil brother 's anti - gay potion.<br /><br />- The evil brother 's cats.<br /><br />- The ending , which I wo n't give away because it MUST be seen to be believed . I warn you though , make sure you 're not eating at the time ! ! ! ! The tub of lard main character / director / producer gets naked . It 's foul . < br /><br />Basically , Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad , but unintentionally the most comical thing you 'll see for a long time . Literally , nothing is good about this excuse for a film , the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times .
0 Oh man , what was Sam Mraovich thinking ? What was anyone who was involved in this " film " thinking ? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of " Ben and Arthur " : Director , writer , producer ( also EXECUTIVE producer ! ) , caster , lead star- you name it , he did it . And he ( Mraovich ) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.<br /><br />So what is wrong with this film ? Everything . The film is about two gay lovers , Ben ( Jamie Brett Gabel ) and Arthur ( Mraovich- * groan * ) . Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people . To make things worse , Ben 's crazy " ex - wife " ( they do n't exactly divorce ) , Tammy ( Julie Belknap ) is steaming mad that Ben 's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together ( saying that she can be gay , too ! ) and Arthur 's Christian devoted , excessively hypocritical , equally batty as Tammy brother , Victor , is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.<br /><br />The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ( ie . Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees ; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate , plus many , many more ) and plot holes to boot ( Victor calls killing Arthur " The Final Plan " which later changes to " The Final Deed " ; Arthur and the private ( intern ) detective drive the same car , blah , blah , blah ) . The " actors " are all very bad and are way , way over the top ; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is " I do n't make sense ? You do n't make sense ! I make sense , that 's who makes sense ! " ) and there so much more wrong with the " movie " that I ca n't write them all down.<br /><br />However , the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about " Ben and Arthur " is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic ( see his fake reviews for " Ben & Arthur " and obvious comments by him on YouTube . ) . Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.<br /><br />So , to conclude , forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- " Ben and Arthur " will knock them right off that title , even Paris Hilton movies look like " The Dark Knight " compared to the monstrosity known as " Ben and Arthur " .
0 Phew -- I do n't what to say . This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers . Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters ' early offerings . Perhaps I should take that back -- I do n't want to insult Waters ' ability as a director / storyteller.<br /><br />I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the " full faith and credibility " clause . It 's " full faith and credit , " by the way!<br /><br />This also reminds me of " The Conrad Boys , " where the main actor is also the writer , director , film editor , etc . Those sort of multi - involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability ( albeit a stunt , some might say ) to pull something off like that .
0 I do n't know what it is about this movie- director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie . I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist , but this movie may be the most important of all time . This movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt ' The Worst Movie Ever Made ' . I 've seen bad movies in my lifetime , but this somehow breaks what I considered bad into something much more hard to imagine.<br /><br />Everything in this movie is hilarious , but the single funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie.<br /><br />Oh wow ...
0 Worst film ever , this is a statement that people here on IMDb often throw around . Whether it 's an Uwe Boll movie , bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay , people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they 're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world.<br /><br />I envy these people , because they 're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes . There are films out there so bad , so hideous , so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad.<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen , i present to you Ben and Arthur , an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it 's a lot like a violent car crash , you know it 's awful but you ca n't stop looking at it . The brainchild of self proclaimed " hollywood actor , director " and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich , this film is legendarily terrible . Let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was . Mr Mraovich not only directed this film , he wrote it , produced it , executive produced it , scored it , edited it and then finally starred in it . This is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is.<br /><br />Everything in this film fails on an epic level , the acting is the worst you will ever witness , the plot is the most ridiculous , the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard . I 'm aware i 've gone on a bit of a tangent here , but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it , i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel , but the truth is it was n't even shot on film , it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust . Do n't get me wrong , i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting , for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film . Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on , even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with Hollywoods finest actors it would still suck , the plot is that atrocious , and the characters are even worse . One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film . You 'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing . Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we 're supposed to root for the hero.<br /><br />I do n't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you 'll experience watching this film ( which i urge you not to pay for ) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is , tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie . In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how " they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call " the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman , quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think . The second is simple , seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont , we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area . I 've never been to Vermont personally but i 'm certain you wo n't find any palm trees there.<br /><br />Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still wo n't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur . Imagine the absolute worst film you 've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still wo n't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur , this film is really that bad.<br /><br />However we should be glad in a way , films like this are a true rarity . They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters . Simply because we 'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we 'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.<br /><br />The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered , and it is called Ben and Arthur .
0 What can I say , this is a piece of brilliant film - making that should have won an Oscar . A copy should be kept safe in a secure vault for posterity . It should be required viewing for all high school students across the world . Sam Mraovich is a genius , perhaps the most genius writer / director / producer / chef / babysitter / walmart greeter to ever grace the cinema world with his art.<br /><br />Where do I begin with this one ? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so completely breathtaking ! And Mraovich as Arthur , wow , he is so attractive I 'm surprised he did n't go for Mr. Universe . I could n't contain myself during the nude scene . I loaned this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how Arthur 's nude scene turned him gay . I am totally supportive of course , because of this film and it 's beautifully crafted lessons in tolerance . Why just yesterday I burned down a church and I wrote " for Sam and Arthur " in its smoldering ashes.<br /><br />The cinematography was the best thing about this film . When that Fed - Ex plane took to the skies amid the palm trees of Vermont , I wept ! Why , I never even knew they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed - Ex planes before this film . It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities . This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich 's school of Screen writing , Acting , Directing , Composing , Casting , Producing , Production Design and Real Estate . I just want to say , " Thank you , Mr. Mraovich . Thank you for bringing this creation into the world . We can never re - pay you enough . "
0 When the film began , I was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera ! In fact , the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie . Even direct to DVD films should have production values better than this ! Heck , a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values ! All too often , the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on -- with no camera person ! Closeups and anything resembling camera - work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups . Yecch ! < br /><br />The film is about two gay men who want to become married . As if was made almost a decade ago , their only option was marrying in Vermont -- times have definitely changed . However , the recent acceptance of gay marriage can not in any way be attributed to this film -- if anything , it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue . According to the film , religious people are one - dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow - minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie -- go figure . I 'm sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue ! < br /><br />The bottom line -- nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and I even hesitate to call this a film . It 's more like a home movie and does n't even merit a listing on IMDb or even inclusion on IMDb 's Bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time . The acting is horrible , the writing is horrible , the direction ( if there even is any ) is horrible , the camera - work is horrible and the plot is horrible . It 's a home movie ! ! There is nothing positive I can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of Ed Wood seem like Oscar contenders in comparison and I am sure the ghost of Mr. Wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess ! < br /><br />I do n't care if you are gay or straight -- this film is not worth your time and I do n't know how they managed to create DVDs of it . I assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time ! Seriously , this gives new meaning to the word ' bad'!<br /><br />By the way , if the one lady in the film WAS a real lawyer , would n't the ability to read be an important prerequisite ? ! I 'm just sayin'.<br /><br />Finally , with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic , ca n't we have a film that 's BETTER than THIS that addresses the issue ? ! This one , sadly , only invites laughter .
0 Oh , Sam Mraovich , we know you tried so hard . This is your magnum opus , a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( as you state on your 1998-era web site ) . Alas , it 's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt . With Ben & Arthur , you do just that.<br /><br />Seemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education , the film 's screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene . It 's this insane excuse of a story that may also be the film 's best ally . Beginning tepidly , the homosexually titular characters Ben and Arthur attempt to marry , going so far as to fly across country to do so , in the shade of Vermont 's finest palm trees . But , all of this posturing is merely a lead - in for BLOOD . Then more BLOOD , and MORE AND MORE BLOOD . I mean , there must be at least $ 20 in fake blood make - up in the final third of this film.<br /><br />The film in its entirety is a technical gaffe . From the sound to the editing to the music , which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard , it 's a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on . It 's such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted here.<br /><br />No matter , Sam . I 'm sure you 've made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls ( such as myself ) to view this film . Sadly , we 're not laughing with you .
0 I tried to like this program ; I really did . I even bought the pilot film , first on VHS and later on DVD . However , I could n't get into this story because its two main characters : " David " ( Bruce Willis ) and " Maddie " ( Cybill Shepherd ) just seemed to in love with themselves , for one thing . I admit was some clever dialog in the shows , which was a key part of the success of the TV program , and I did appreciate of lot of that dialog . < br /><br />Basically , this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the ' 30s and ' 40s with male versus female . You get lots of arguing , accusations , yelling and screaming . A lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering , but I hate it , so I never got on the Moonlighting bandwagon . < br /><br />Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless aide " Agnes , " was entertaining . It 's too bad she had such little air time . Shepherd was nice on the eyes and I suppose women would say the same for Willis , but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off .
0 This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD.<br /><br />Television moved out of my life in 1981 , so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I 'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers . < br /><br />(Possible spoiler warning ) < br /><br />The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic " caveman meets fluffball " yarn , where a " charming " red - blooded he - man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs . The premises that the script 's " wit " is based on must have already felt stale around 1950 . It also contains some frankly bad writing , as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain , strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance . < br /><br />I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment , but in this particular case I 'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it . < br /><br />In one sense , however , this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans : in addition to the pilot episode , it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job . Both features show to what amazing extent Willis ' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 ( Die Hard 1 , In Country ) . Impressive ! < br /><br />Rating ( and I _ am _ a Bruce Willis fan ) : 2 out of 10
0 The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers ' career . The plot was very simplistic , and if done the right way could have been handled nicely , but instead it was poorly executed . Part of the reasons why this film was n't that good was the poor dialog , cheap laughs , choppy directing , and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete.<br /><br />The acting , on the other hand , was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture . I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done , with the occasional lines that will be remembered . For example , there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says " Ah , you all look the same to me . " I hate to admit it , but I laughed out loud with that line.<br /><br />Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable , David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery ( his last film as well , not a way to end a career ) , and Sid Ceasar ( who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capone 's relative who works for the FBI ) . These characters also kept me watching.<br /><br />The sets were also nice . Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud - of - a - picture.<br /><br />In all honesty , my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan . Otherwise , you 're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil .
0 I can hardly believe I watched this again last night after more than 25 years ... <br /><br />Some time back , I watched 6 Fu films in a row ... Boris Karloff , and all 5 Chris Lees . The last 2 Lees , both directed ( and I use that word loosely ) by Jess Franco , were abominable . At the time , I skipped this one , remembering that , in some ways , it was EVEN WORSE.<br /><br />Well , I watched it . NEVER again . You know what 's worse that an abominable film ? A really WELL - MADE piece of S***. And that 's what FIENDISH PLOT is . It is a VERY good - looking movie . GREAT production design , sets , costumes , music , photography , editing , mostly good cast , some decent acting ... <br /><br /> ... and absolutely , positively , one of the WORST SCRIPTS in movie history ! ! ! ! ! AAAUGH ! ! ! ! ! The first minute of the film is so deceptive ... one might mistake this for a decent movie . And then they start singing " Happy birthday to Fu " ... and it goes downhill . Having Burt Kwouk ( of whom his master says , " Your face-- is familiar . " ) accidentally pour out Fu 's elixir vitae to put out a fire , resulting in his being condemned to torture , burial and having one of his ears cut off , was the closest thing to funny they had . It was like someone decided they wanted to do a " campy " film-- so ridiculous it would be funny . RIDICULOUS , it is ... FUNNY ... it AIN'T. At all.<br /><br />It 's sad , because it 's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a LOT of research into the Fu Manchu series in order to get so much of it " right " . With a different script-- either a really FUNNY one , or a dead SERIOUS one , they might have-- could have-- SHOULD have-- had a classic on their hands . A film that could have made one forget the horror of those Jess Franco atrocities ... instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces , by comparison.<br /><br />There was a period in the late 70 's when a whole slew of classic 30 's characters were revived in movies that were universally awful . Buck Rogers , Flash Gordon , Tarzan , The Lone Ranger , Charlie Chan , even Doc Savage . I 'm not sure , this one may be the worst of the lot . It took great self - control not to fast - forward over whole sections of it , especially any scenes containing Sid Caesar ( FBI chief who was also Al Capone 's cousin-- you see what I mean ? ) . It is n't just that the ideas in the film are n't funny ... they often make NO SENSE whatsoever . Like when they " audition " police officers to impersonate the King and Queen , and we wind up seeing people " audition " dance - hall routines like singing , dancing , and riding a unicycle . How many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them ? < br /><br />As I said , a shame ... and a real waste of all that talent , including that of Peter Sellers ( who played both Fu and Nayland Smith ) , Burt Kwouk ( who 'd been in a Chris Lee Fu film in his time ) , Helen Mirren ( the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half - hour of the film ! ) . I begin to wonder if anyone will EVER make a " proper " Fu Manchu film , or if fans will have to settle for Karloff 's being almost the ONLY one ?
0 It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers work may be disappointed with this , his last venture . But surely any fan of Sellers will find delight in all of his films , simply because of the man 's huge talent . and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception . Unfortunately this would prove to be Sellers last film , ( it was even released after his death ) , but it 's still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise . And not only do we get one Sellers , but we get to , for Sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis , the equally bizarre Nayland Smith , the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old Fu . The story is equally outlandish as we follow Fu 's outrageous antics to make his age - defying elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him . Just like any of Sellers greater films , the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him , as well as many of his familiar - faced co - stars - David Tomlinson , Sid Caesar , John Le Mesurier , Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few . It 's also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk ( Cato ) enjoying a cameo with Sellers - albeit playing the same role , but still nice . The story is indeed pretty ridiculous , as are many of the characters involved , which classes this as a film strongly under the Goon influence . And , although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy , there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction . The film failed commercially on it 's initial release due to the entire world mourning after Sellers ' death ( the film was released less than 3 weeks after)and there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was Sellers last film . It 's far from a great film - it 's often slow , too ridiculous , and sometimes the jokes simply are n't there - but it is nevertheless enjoyable - if only for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers .
0 There 's no getting around it-- this movie is terrible . I 've seen the old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies , I 'm familiar with the characters and it 's serial origins , but it 's still just godawful . However , Peter Sellers ' genius still shines through with his portrayal of Nayland Smith , with echoes of sadness , tragedy , and strength simmering through a stoic facade ; it 's a performance I place on par with Peter Cushing 's portrayal of Van Helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all Cushing 's " Dracula " movies . If the movie was done in a more serio - comic vein like BUBBA HO - TEP by way of the 1960 's AVENGERS TV show , this could 've been something special . If you 're a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers completest , this is something you need to see , but it 's a pass for anyone else .
0 Even if one did n't realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film 's release , THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR . FU MANCHU would be painful viewing . It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmer 's famous Oriental villain but it lacks any focus . The potential for satirical commentary on the anti - Oriental overtones of Rohmer 's concept are ignored . Indeed , the movie employs racist insults . There are hardly any actual jokes or gags , just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines . It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs . Most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well.<br /><br />And then there 's Peter Sellers . He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu , who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith . Sellers is n't one hundred per cent bad ; he conveys a quirky warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he 's oddly moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment . But most of the time , he plays both roles with a weary grimness , thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities . Sellers ' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating ; he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny . < br /><br />A few genuinely witty lines , an apt slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk ( Cato in the PINK PANTHER films ) as one of Manchu 's minions , and Helen Mirren 's amusing musical numbers can not salvage this mess . If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedic genius , they wo n't learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR . FU MANCHU .
0 Ok so here 's the basic plot . It is 1933 , Peter Sellers is Dr Fu Manchu , a 168 year old Chinese man who has lived quite a long time . The film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that ( even the film never mentions ) prolongs his life . Well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant ( Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies ) and he orders his minions to then go find 6 rare items to make the elixir . This creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into London , to meet up with Dr Fu 's nemisis , a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith , also played by Sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure.<br /><br />This was apparantly Sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died . The terrible tragedy is that he was in it . Sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable ' funny ' roles in the Panther movies and particualrly in the movie ' The Party ' , is anything BUT that in this film . This film was absolute torture to sit through and I could n't even finish it . He completly DIES and I kept cringing while watching Sellers performance . After coming of the great work of ' Being There ' a year earlier how , I mean HOW can he make this and HOW did this thing even get made ? ? ? Like one person mentioned the first 10 .. 15 minutes are ok but then it is ALL DOWNHILL ... <br /><br />Avoid like the plague.<br /><br />Rating 1 out of 10 .
0 .... shut it off . The prologue with Fu Manchu 's birthday , and the opening credits of the assassins training , is amusing . Then it drops off faster than hair sprayed with Neat . Look for a cameo by Cato in the beginning , with a figurative wink at the audience .
0 It 's one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising . I have spoken before on another film , in which the commercial for the ( comedy ) film makes it seem funnier than it is . Seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film . What I and my brother who went and saw it with me did n't know is that the scene used in the TV ad was the very last scene in the film ! < br /><br />Since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the film , I can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use ! The last scene is , thanks to a youth potion , Dr . Fu Manchu turns from a long bearded old man , into a bright young Asian / Elvis like rock star ! ( With back up singers no less ! ) < br /><br />Set for no real reason , in the 1930's , Peter Sellers does his best with the material at hand but he 's not given any really good reason for his " comedic " moments . The rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and I sat all through this barely laughing at anything . It was only natural that we were expecting a " Pink Panther " type comedy , Peter Sellers was so great at that . < br /><br />It 's a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died . His appearance on the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this ill - conceived flop . Still , I do n't fault him . I fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this . 2 stars is being generous ! !
0 This may not be the very worst movie Peter Sellers ever did ( I think that laurel goes to " The Prisoner of Zenda " ) but it is surely the most depressing . Sellers , especially sans makeup as Nayland Smith , looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy . As Fu Manchu , he looks hardly better and spends most of the film ( with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents ) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup . The supporting players also look tired and run down , and Sid Caeser 's presence is offensive even without his constant references to " Chinks ! " ( One bright spot : this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray Asians so insultingly ... or , for that matter , star a non - Asian as one ! ) . The film seems surprisingly cheap , with soupy photography and drab sets - even the whiz - bang Elvis number at the end looks cut - rate . Only the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall , thin , nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair . All in all , this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic 's death , and an even eerier documentation of his dying .
0 I do n't have much to say about this movie . It could have been a wonderful tour - de - force for Peter Sellers , but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history . That it was Sellers final movie makes it all the more painful.<br /><br />The terrible screenplay , direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made.<br /><br />I wish so much that I could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber , but it 's a lifeless , humorless disaster . The truth hurts.<br /><br />Peter , why could n't you have stopped at BEING THERE ?
0 An unfunny , unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to Peter Sellers ' career . It is a pity this movie was ever made .
0 This is not an all - around terrible comedy , but it is very DULL . It has barely any laughs , and it wastes its lavish production values . There is one poignant moment near the end , when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his " nemesis " and tells him that " You 've been my one worthy adversary ; and now we can start all over again " . That scene , however , along with Burt Kwouk 's amusing cameo in the beginning , are the only memorable parts of the movie . ( * 1/2 )
0 The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu ( 1980 ) . This is hands down the worst film I 've ever seen . What a sad way for a great comedian to go out .
0 I actually saw this movie in the theater back in it 's original release . It was painful to watch Peter Sellers embarrass himself so badly . The story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow , and the ending was ridiculous . It was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen . I wo n't say that I 'm a huge Peter Sellers fan , but I did thoroughly enjoy the Pink Panther series and I felt that he gave a strong performance in Being There . But this film should never have been made . From what I 've read , he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him . Fine , but that still does n't excuse the studio actually releasing the film .
0 This is , quite literally , the worst movie I have ever watched in my life . It may be the worst movie possible . Some movies are so bad that they 're good ; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful . It is the anti - enantiodromia . We bought it with the intent to heckle , and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks ; instead , we sat in stunned silence , pitying poor Peter Sellers.<br /><br />This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings . It is worse than the Matrix sequels . It is worse than Krull . It is worse than any Batman movie.<br /><br />Do not , under any circumstances , let this movie approach within ten feet of your television .
0 ... or maybe it just IS this bad . The plot is a cheap rehash of the first , which is weird , since it 's supposed to be a prequel , not a sequel . Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first , with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first , only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely . Where the first had a great cast , this one consist of B - list actors and rejects . The acting is mostly horrendously bad . Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first , as is nearly every major character , including the ones who were n't in the first movie . I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode , but that 's no excuse . They did n't have to turn the ( bad ) footage into a movie . Only one thing is marginally good , and that 's the erotic sequences . However , as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first , even this is n't raising it above a rating of 1 . If you have a chance to see it for free , and you 're a straight guy , it could be worth checking out , if you want something erotic that is n't porn . If not , avoid at all costs . 1/10
0 There is n't one decent scene.<br /><br />Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time . Proof that you a can start anywhere . The guy playing Sebastian sucks , too . He does n't even look much like Ryan Phillipe . More like Joshua Jackson . The two other girls are terrible , as well . < br /><br />Then the dialogue is also crap.<br /><br />Sebastian ( About to have threesome ) : If you ca nt beat them ... < br /><br />Virgin Girl : Who says you ca n't beat ' em?<br /><br />Lame.<br /><br />The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original . In the first film , it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex . One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad , aside from the fact that she 's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar , was that she was " the only girl he could n't have and it killed him " . She was a tease who liked playing with him . The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting . Then in this P.O.S. , it implies that he CAN have her , along with a girl on the side . What ? And we do n't even see the sex , either . It 's implied , making it not only stupid , pointless , and contradictory , but worthless too.<br /><br />And in the first one , Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love , making him a loser . Even though he won the bet , that crumbled his chances . Then in this excrement , he looses AND falls in love . So she does n't screw " losers " , only complete losers ? Another thing : it 's stated that Sebastian has never been in love , so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl?<br /><br />Then at the end , virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be Kathryn 's evil lesbian lover ( dun dun dun ) and , like I said , they go into a lame offscreen threesome . Stupid . < br /><br />There 's several other plot contradictions . Did the writer even see the first film ? A 5 year old can point his stuff out.<br /><br />After the threesome , Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin , corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sit in the front , listen , and smile evilly into the camera . < br /><br />The end ... < br /><br />Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film . I guess all it took to make little Sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls . Interesting .
0 If you ask me the first one was really better one . Look at Sarah M. G. , she is real , mean , cruel girl , look at Amy Adams she is just little fool hanging around . She is nothing ! People do n't adore her ! Second , Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie , now he is " baby face " . Story is not that good , and i do not understand . Why did n't they make this one first , it is the beginning . Loosy actors , nothing with story . This is not cruel , this is playing . First one has better actors , better story , and its mean . I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3 . It is not the worst movie I saw , but in compaer with first one its one big , big , big nothing .
0 Because ' cruel ' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers . Where do you even begin ? In a spout of b*tchiness , I 'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie . Scratch that . Nearly does not belong in that sentence . I ca n't think of even one character who was portrayed well . Although , in all fairness , it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way . Still , the girl who played Katherine ( whose name I purposefully do n't include - I 'm pretending she does n't exist ) remains one of the worst actors I 've ever seen , only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian . The story was God awful . It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways . Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit ( grudgingly ) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise . And the ending was at least slightly humorous . But this film is up there with the worst I 've seen . Do n't watch it . Just do n't . There is absolutely no value in watching it . None . It only takes away the enjoyment of the first .
0 They had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat . In the first Cruel Intentions , we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do . There is almost NO character development whatsoever in this prequel . It 's actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me . It was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f - words . And the end makes absolutely no sense and does n't explain anything . The writing was just terrible . Another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original . Such as " down boy " , or the kissing scene , and a few others I ca n't remember . I was not impressed at all by Robin 's acting , but Amy did a great job . That 's about the only thing that reconciled this movie .
0 Basically , Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1 , again , only poorly done . The story is exactly the same as the first one ( even some of the lines ) , with only a few exceptions . The cast is more unknown , and definitely less talented . Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it , I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft - core porn . I 'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers ... and I always feel bad saying that , because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a two - hour waste of my life . It literally amazes me that some movies get made , and this is no exception ... I ca n't believe they 'd make a third one .
0 Cruel Intentions 2 is bloody awful , I mean uber - bad . Words can not explain how bad it is , but I 'll give it a go anyway.<br /><br />The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first film . Sebastian ( Robin Dunne ) , is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to New York . There he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down . Unfortunately he has to deal with his step - sister Kathryn ( Amy Adams ) wants to drag him down . Sebastain starts to fall in love Danielle ( Sarah Thompson ) , the innocent daughter of the Headmaster of the school . Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a ' whore - house ' . Kathryn also wants to get revenge with Cherie ( Keri Lynn Pratt ) , who humiliated her during the school assembly . Kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school , a similar sub - plot to the first film.<br /><br />Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a cancelled TV - show , which was turned into a prequel . There are so many problems with the film . It is poorly written , unfunny , and badly acted . Luckily for Amy Adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress . Whilst Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world , Cruel Intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon.co.uk ' a randy version of Saved by the Bell ' . There were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film , but in Cruel Intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film should n't be , such as Kathryn having an affair with a teacher . Other ideas also do n't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students . The film also had a major problem of sexualised 15/16-years - old . I know that teenagers do have sex , sometimes a lot , but when done on film or television , is treated very seriously . One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie ( who is around 14/15 in the film ) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm . The idea of turning a girl around 14/15 into a slut is just very wrong with me , and should n't be made into a subject of comedy . The jokes in the film fall flat , whether if it 's a verbal gag like ' she goes all moist when she sees you ' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.<br /><br />There is a lot wrong with this film , which I do n't have time to go into , but I say it should be avoid . Just watch Cruel Intentions , whilst not a classic , still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.<br /><br />This film is just a pervert 's wet dream , having school - kids having lots of sex with each other .
0 I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning , a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies . But still I think it was n't good , this movie was n't good at all . The reasons why are many.<br /><br />The acting is n't all that good , and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90 's Chevy Chase comedy . I mean , come on , like the handcuff situation , and the poker situation amongst the servants ... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one , and that s OK . But if I had n't seen the first one before seeing this , it would have sucked even worse . Like the ending , it came very suddenly , and I felt like I got no closure what so ever ... Sebastian changed very suddenly , and this This movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1 , and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good . The score is the same as in the first one , and it did n't feel like a movie at all ... <br /><br />They should have handled the situations with more style and class , but they did n't , and therefore , this movie turned out bad ...
0 The first Cruel Intentions , the original , is my favorite movie of all time . It was an absolute masterpiece . So how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad . Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie . In this one , Amy Adams sucks . She is terrible . And could n't they have found a chick who actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar ? At least the same hair color ! ! ! i mean come on . Robin Dunn is n't as bad as Adams , but he is absolutely terrible when compared to Ryan Phillipe . The Sebastian in the first film is devious , deceitful , and much more evil than the Sebastian in the prequel . And what is up with the story line . It basically goes like this ... <br /><br />1- Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school , so the movie says , although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life , and how he has been with girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York , and just suddenly decides he 's going to turn himself around . He " falls in love " with Danielle ( might i remind you that in the original , Sarah Michelle giller says quote " you broke up with THE FIRST PERSON you ever loved because i said to- so how can he have been in love in the prequel ? ? ? ) . And he 's all nice and charming , and all " good person " , as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing.<br /><br />3- He does a complete 180 , and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie , and then seducing Cherry.<br /><br />I mean , its terrible . And i loved the first one so much . I have n't even seen the third one yet . I hope to god its better than this prequel .
0 This so - called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons . The plots are identical as is most of the script . I loved the book its based off of , and I loved the first movie , but I 'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie . The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal , and ... I just ca n't stress how bad the movie was . If you do n't want to take my word for it , just watch it , and you 'll see what I mean . If you 've read a review that says that ' If you likes the first one , you 'll like the second one ' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE ! Although the plot is not even as good . They took so many lines from the first movie , Its hard to tell which movie you 're watching .
0 I was mad anyone made this movie . I was even more angry I lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this . I could have had a wax job and been more entertained . At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts . I was a bit confused at first but then I caught on and realized what was going on . By this time the film was half way through , and Yes I am a procrastinator but I always want to see things through until the end . So I stuck it out I watched it all . Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions , they just are n't convincing . I 've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie . If you like bad movies with bad acting watch this .
0 From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful ' Cruel Intentions ' , and how flat it landed . You 'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second scene , you meet the two best things in this movie , Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother . That is , if you can get past the fact that Kathryn was n't blonde in the first film ... Then the movie goes on , you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago , and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past , here called Danielle , and a Cecile , here called Cherie ... How original is that for a prequel . Then it turns into a low budget ' Wild Things ' type of film with lots and lots of oh - my " twists " . As I mentioned , Robin Dunne was a very bad choice . Not that he is a bad actor , he 's good .. He just does n't have the charisma Ryan did . Amy Adams , who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time , once again delivers . But with all the talent in the world , there is no way one could save this trash . As a whole , this " movie " feels like a ' Beverly Hills , 90210 ' episode . The score has been stolen from ' Cruel Intentions ' and ' Jawbreaker ' ... Yes , they used the score from JAWBREAKER ... Could n't they at least leave that one alone ? ! You 'll want to pass this one . If you want more Cruel Intentions , watch Stephen Frears ' Dangerous Liaisons .
0 What can I say about Cruel intentions 2 ? Well , I can say in all honesty , I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork - orange - style.<br /><br />The film ' stars ' Robin Dunne ( No , I never heard of him either ) , whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout . In a case of terrible casting , Dunne attempts ( and fails ) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic , charmer . Since the actor is not handsome , nor charismatic nor charming , the character is left wholly unbelievable . Amy Adams , ( she was in an episode of buffy one time ) , tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life ... However , Adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion , often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera . There were two good actors in the film however , Barry Flatman ( Saw 2 & Saw 3 ) and Mimi Rogers ( Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers ) , made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a 2 , not a 1.<br /><br />The film itself is a poor version of the original , with such lows as carbon copy 's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show , it might have worked , but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts .
0 < br /><br />When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax , I was shocked that it had been made . Cruel Intentions , in my opinion , was one of the best teen - oriented films made in years . This prequel had certain things incongruent with the original . ( Sebastian 's father married into wealth , then why does he have a rich Aunt on long island?)<br /><br />Then I found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie , but rather a television series , Manchester Prep . After hearing that , it made sense to me that it was n't the same as the movie , just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form . < br /><br />I think that Roger Kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had , AFTER the series was n't picked up by Fox . It just seems like something that would happen too fast ( Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn ) and I just do n't know where they would go with the next episode , since it would n't be leading to the 1999 Film ( Which the newer ending is directed right towards.)<br /><br />One thing I did n't like was that it suggested Sebastian and his father had married into the wealth , which is n't typically looked good upon in this area of new york , and sine Katharyn 's mother was just an adult version of her , it did n't seem like something a woman in her position would do , marry a man not of her social class . < br /><br />As a prequel this is fairly lame . But I would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series .
0 Alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie . As for 1999 i feel that one of the top five films was Cruel Intentions . It had everything a great movie should have except for an original story , being adapted from a novel it was still damn good . On to Cruel Intentions 2 which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep . Which must not have happened . Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand . Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also . Well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed . It starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughter 's naked picture on the net he puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked . This would have been alright if the lady was not like 50 . And basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original . Which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was . But you can not do that with a movie . This actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part 1 . But with Sebastian being more or less just a prankster and Kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story , this movie had no foundation to it . Whoever did the casting on this thing was way off . They could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no , they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors . I am using this term although i do nt know why . They for sure did nt do any in this movie.<br /><br />All this movie is a bunch of one liners that do nt even match the wit that the original had , well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1 . Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used , as if to show why the kids are like this . It did nt work though . The best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world . The on screen tension that was there made the film what it was . This thing Really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this .
0 I was willing to go with the original _ Cruel Intentions . _ It went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories . However , this movie was , in my opinion , a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices . I did n't honestly care what happened to any of them . The strongest part of the original story ( Les Liasons , not CI ) is the characters and their interactions , not the events themselves . I was n't clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel , especially since the title includes a number " 2 , " I expected a sequel , but then determined that it must be a companion piece . Over all , I must say that this movie read , to me at least , like a soft porn version of Les Liasons . I was not impressed .
0 This movie was like " The Disney Channel after Dark . " Take out the " are n't we naughty " language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who does n't describe " Saved by the Bell " as quality television . The dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty , one might think the screenplay was the product of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating . If that was Roger Kumble 's intention , mission accomplished .
0 Christ , oh Christ ... One watches stunned , incredulous , and possibly deranged , as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise . Can such things be ? Does this movie actually exist , or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company , sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen ? I 've seen a lot of films , and a lot of bad films , but nothing prepared me for this ; by the end of it I was a gibbering , snivelling wreck , tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog , clawing at the walls , howling till my lungs were sore . I pleaded desperately , frenziedly for mercy ( to whom this appeal was made , I do n't know ) , and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro . Sweet Weeping Jesus , the memories ... sometimes they come back to me . When I 'm at my most vulnerable , when I 'm least able to handle them . I shudder , I break down in tears , I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood , but I ca n't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind . I 'm haunted . I 'm damaged . I 'm a shell of a man.<br /><br />The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience , which can only mean one of two things : a ) the film does , in fact , exist , or b ) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions . What is quite mind - boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal , or at least have not been left traumatised by it . Perhaps they 're part of the operation . God damn them , the maniacs ! God damn them all to Hell ! ! ! ! ! !
0 This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you have n't seen either movie and want to but do n't want the spoilers , please do n't read this review!<br /><br />While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time , the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions . The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe 's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar 's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed . Neither can pull off the smarmy , snooty rich - kid attitude that the original actors did . It 's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn , but if you listen closely enough you 'll recognize it . There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn , then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie ? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie ( with Reese Witherspoon 's character).<br /><br />Also , the tie - in with the photography/"You could be a model " comment at the end was totally lame and did n't add anything at all . Overall , this movie was a waste of time . I ca n't believe they made a Cruel Intentions 3 .
0 There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video . Of course it really would n't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video . This one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential : Amy Adams ( am Oscar nominee and talented actress ) , Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent , and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas . The film is also misstated : this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that . This was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay - per - view masturbation films . Fortunately for the actors , hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes . So if you are looking to see something naughty , but do n't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter .
0 Who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money . I hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring D - Lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one.<br /><br />I found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one.<br /><br />Whoever thought that this straight - to - video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because I think what pretty much most of the people who 've seen this film thinks WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP ! ! ! !
0 I think this is probably one of the worst movies I 've watched in a long time.<br /><br />Trying to get the ' same characters ' with different people is * such * a bad idea . If they could n't get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this one , they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it . Instead they get NEW actors that are horrible at what they did . I seriously felt like I was at a High School or ( bad ) College play with the lever of acting these people put forth.<br /><br />Where do they get some of these people ? Was this their first movie ? It sure seemed like it.<br /><br />This movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech . I had just got done watching the first one and popped # 2 in . I was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show I 've seen in a while . I do n't hardly EVER * EVER * turn off a movie , but this one definitely went off after about 30 - 40 min .
0 I do n't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time I feel I have to . I have spoken of taste in another review , saying it 's all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film , if you like it , it simply means you have bad taste.<br /><br />I love films . I loved " Isle of the Dead " which is pretty much an unknown B&W film . I even liked " Scream " and " Scary Movie " I liked these films because they have , if not a lot , at least something good about them . I appreciate 99.9 % of the films I 've seen because they tell a story which I have n't heard before , and most directors only make films with a good storyline . Throughout this film I was thinking " Where is this going ? " ( even near the end ) " Where did they get these awful actors from " ? " Was that supposed to be a joke ? " and suchlike . With the obvious twist looming I was sceptical , but hoped it would perhaps " make " the film and prove I had n't wasted my time . I was sadly mistaken . The storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was . Here 's a rundown : Storyline  much like the first film , which was alright , this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations . The situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable . The twist was terrible , it did n't make me feel a thing , like excitement or WOW . Just " My GOD . " There was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think " Oooo was n't that clever " because it was n't . In " Fight Club " there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where Tyler 's true identity was cryptically shown , and when you watched it again you saw more , it really was a work of genius , how it was written , laid out and directed . This was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist . I think it was " wild things " that had like a pretty poor double twist and I still liked the film because the rest was OK and it was n't trying too hard to be a big twist . Its like the CI2 writer thought it was gon na be the best twist ever . But really , its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end . The film ended almost immediately afterward , with the whole film void by Sebastian 's whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced , paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl . Acting  the actors in this film are appalling . Almost as bad a " Sunset Beach . " - Extremely corny and badly performed . It 's not even so bad it 's good like " Hunk " . The worst acting I thought came from Amy Adams who played Kathryn , it was a rigid , pathetic and badly thought out performance by her . Robin Dunne was also poor . I have n't seen " American Psycho II " yet , but no doubt his laid back " cool " style has ruined that film also.<br /><br />I ca n't even say it is a good film for teens , as its not . If my son or daughter liked this film I 'd be ashamed . But they would n't anyway , as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film , which this film has none of . Really . I 'm disappointed that some have said " you might not be in the age bracket for this film , and so dislike it " I like all the films now that I liked as a teen and had very good taste . Also , do you really think that when you reach 20 + you suddenly do n't like any teenish story lines ? No . I liked " Mean Girls " and other generic teen films , and watch " Beverly Hills 90210 " all the time . There 's no excuse for poor directing , acting and screenplay I 'm afraid . Besides , I was 16/17 when I first watched it . If anything , being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film . I ca n't believe anyone can give it 10/10 either , one of my favourite films is " Memento " and I gave it 9 as I know there can be better . It is a shame for this site that people do that , give 10s flippantly , or do n't get the films / show , and so give it 2.<br /><br />Anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste , and perhaps their lives , and with this realise that this is the worst film EVER made . ( worse than " Loch Ness")<br /><br />If you are n't a teenager with bad taste , or simply do n't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film .
0 Okay , let me break it down for you guys ... IT 'S HORRIBLE ! < br /><br />If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this . I 'm sorry but this movie is stupid , true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic ... this movie a crock ! A lot of bad acting * NOTE The Shower scene * " Kissing Cousins " ? ? ? ? ? ? What kind of line is that ? " Slipery when wet " ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Can we say DUH - M ! This movie had effort , I 'll give you that , but it was too stupid ! They even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually .... WASN'T FUNNY ! It was pathetic . Not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast . It 's as if they made them look different on purpose or something ! I like watching it when I 'm really really really board which does n't happen occasionally . For those of you who did like it ... Okay , what were you thinking ? Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar ? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it , DUH ! But this movie does n't , no offense Amy Adams . Oh , yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart ? ? ? ? ? UGH !
0 I 've seen this movie today for the first time and I never heard of it before , probably because of it 's poor message . < br /><br />First of all , the directing itself is quite good , the actors played well and the CGI ( I 'm not a fan of CGI ) is magnificent . But that alone does n't make a movie . No story at all , no message behind beautiful exploited talents.<br /><br />Or do I have to make people remember , the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story . And this is what 's missing the whole 7 minutes.<br /><br />There for a simple 4 rating .
0 Friz Freleng 's ' Speedy Gonzalez ' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimson 's ' Cat - tails for Two ' . In that cartoon , Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted . Despite looking significantly more handsome , Speedy never developed into much of a character . A big hat , tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and that 's pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him . Nevertheless , the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio 's latter days . While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently ( rather oddly ) paired up with Daffy Duck , they still leave much to be desired , relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula . In this self - titled episode , Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat . Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon , Sylvester 's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat . His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable . undemanding role of pursuer . This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture . Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come . Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs , ' Speedy Gonzalez ' won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born .
0 Seriously , I 've read some of the reviews on this film , and I have to ask , were you people watching the same movie.<br /><br />Yes , I give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles , but so what ? < br /><br />None of the characters are likable , the story seems aimless , Karen Black is simply not a very good actress . Donald Sutherland is just icky . ( and his character " Homer Simpson " makes me wish for the animated version . D'oh ! ) Then you had the creepy child actor , the creepier Billy Barty , and so on.<br /><br />This is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go , " What the heck ! "
0 A propaganda film for the Palestinian " cause " . If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , you will need to look elsewhere . If you are an anti - Semite ( or merely an anti - Zionist --- nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country , right ? ) or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals ( e.g. , mass murder , the destruction of Israel ) , this is the documentary for you . Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US . However , any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video . I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation are n't corrupted by this anti - Semitic filth .
0 The movie has only one flaw , unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece.<br /><br />It starts with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of disputed territories . It fails to address the reason Israelis are there . Egypt , Syria , Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel . This is why Israel " occupys " their land , because those countries lost it in a war they started.<br /><br />The film also claims that Israel has defied the U N by not complying with Resolution 242 . Problem is , 242 was rejected immediately upon it 's inception by ..... the palestinians , making it void.<br /><br />Many films are put together well , and can really show footage that changes minds , but remember , when watching anything , believe none of what you hear , and only half of what you see.<br /><br />All participants in this film are known critics of Israel , and some have made many antisemitic public comments , removing any possible credibility to their words.<br /><br />All participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively , not by some palestinian sympathizer .
0 It 's been said several times - not least by me - that watching an Eric Rohmer film is like watching paint dry ; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer resents this ( he does n't deny it , but then how could he , he just resents it ) so much so that his new movie , which may also be his last , Inch Allah , is set so far back in time that it 's like watching woad dry . Those wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague , Cahiers du Cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea . Reality is not high on Rohmer 's agenda so that in 5th Century France we have at one extreme a château that would not be out of place in the Loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut . The story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does Rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for Special Needs pupils was captured on film by accident . One is almost tempted to say ' Come back Godard , all is forgiven ' but even this woeful production ca n't make me utter those words .
0 How do I begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the ` worst film of all time ' by the ` worst director of all time ? ' A film that could develop a cult following because it 's ` so bad it 's good?'<br /><br />An analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band - wagon syndrome -- let 's bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it , and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we 'd cite.<br /><br />The film 's universal poor quality goes without saying-- ' Sixteen Years of Alcohol ' is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it , but I believe this film could go the distance . IMDb does n't allow enough words to cite all the films failures , and it be much easier to site the elements ' Sixteen Years of Alcohol ' does right . Unfortunately , those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film 's poorness that that 's a task not worth pursuing.<br /><br />My impressions ? I thought I knew what I was getting into , I had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one ( wish that suggestion had been cups of Vodka ) . Despite my low expectations , ' Sixteen Years of Alcohol ' failed to entertain me even on a ` make fun of the bad movie ' level . Not just bad , but obnoxiously bad as though Jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny . .. and supposedly Jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie ? Even after viewing the ' Sixteen Years of Alcohol ' promotional literature , I have trouble believing Jobson 's sincerity . Pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin / chuckle moments ( all I 'm sure none intentional)spiced the film , and those few elements prevented me from turning the DVD off . So bad it 's good ? No . It had just enough ' I ca n't believe this is a serious movie moments ' to keep me from turning it off , and nothing more.<br /><br />Definitely a film to watch with a group of bad - movie connoisseurs . Get your own running commentary going . That would 've significantly improved the experience for me . So bad it 's Mike Myers commentating in his cod Scottish accent on it as it runs , to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce " Ok dare ma man , pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey " .
0 Rounding out the 1929 - 30 all - talkie " Our Gang " release schedule , " A Tough Winter " features two storylines . First , Wheezer and Mary Ann , home alone on a wintry day , decide to make some taffy . Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show . The problem : Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix ! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!<br /><br />The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit , a neighbor / handyman of the Gang , and his interactions with the Gang.<br /><br />"A Tough Winter , " to my knowledge , has never been shown on television , although it is available on home video . The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty , sly , and slow - moving character . " Our Gang " producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a " skilled comic " and used this " Our Gang " entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day . Understandably , Fetchit 's characterization is offensive to many people today , which explains why the film has been shelved.<br /><br />Although there are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy , " A Tough Winter " is a plodding and meandering effort . If one positive came out of this film , it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies . The sound in the film is good , and some of the sound effects used are very funny . For this reason , this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930 - 31 " Our Gang " films.<br /><br />3 out of 10 .
0 This Hal Roach comedy short , A Tough Winter , is the ninety - ninth in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series and the eleventh talkie . Bascally a showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit who gets special billing here , we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out . Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by Stepin to read it since he ca n't read it during the day as he goes to NIGHT school . It happens to be from his sweetheart in Tennesse so now Farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since it 's too hot for him to hear ! In another room , Weezer relays instructions to Mary Ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen , he misses the lady announcer 's segue to rice pudding and Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux ! After the concoction is completed , Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result . As they all try to clean the mess , Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances ' functions such a telephone that vacuums , a vacuum that rings , and a refrigerator that plays music ! The End . What I 've just described portends the meandering nature of this " Our Gang " short that served as the pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit movie short series . It 's just as well that it never took place as Fetchit 's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today . Many of the scenes I 've just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me . So in summary , A Tough Winter is a curio worth seeing at least once . By the way , Stepin 's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry .
0 What a wasted cast.<br /><br />This is one of the most disappointing films I 've seen.<br /><br />Usually Roger Ebert does not let me down , but I feel cheated after seeing this movie.<br /><br />The only thrill is seeing Elizabeth banks in her bra . That is a sorry statement about this movie . It held so much promise , but it was like dry humping a transvestite.<br /><br />This is self absorbed tripe.<br /><br />I can not express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie , and hope I can forewarn you of the same disappointment .
0 I thought they should have called this movie " Whites " instead of " Heights " . Godawful ... the kind of film that makes people hate New Yorkers . People who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so important ... give me a break . Such a lily white cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in it , this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal it ... and so they introduce , get this , a character even whiter than the rest of the cast ( I thought he was an albino at first)who 's supposed to be Welsh!I'm still trying to decipher that accent ! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of film that 's able to fool so many people into thinking it 's worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious . Better to fill the theaters with MI5 - 10 than with this pretentious crap ... must have been a better play because you ca n't fall off the floor .
0 Pam Grier stars as Coffy . She 's a nurse who seeks revenge , on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine . Like any 70s Blaxploitation flick , you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts . < br /><br />There were scores of these films made during the 70s , and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike . This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films , and the degrading , stereotypical characters . Especially the female characters . < br /><br />Other common threads between Coffy , and other films of its type , include brutal violence , corrupt cops , car chases , a generous abundance of nudity , and sex - crazed gorgeous women . Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug - dealers , pimps , mobsters , and other criminal scum.<br /><br />Pam Grier , was the undisputed queen of 70s Blaxploitation heroines . She was magnificent , being both tough - as - nails , and drop - dead gorgeous . Like in her other films , Pam outshines the other characters , in Coffy . In fact , Pam is so charismatic on screen , that these sorts of films are unwatchable , without her as the main character . < br /><br />If you like Pam Grier , you 're better off seeing her other films , like Foxy Brown , or perhaps Friday Foster . These films have much less empty sleaze , than Coffy does . Pam 's character in Coffy , degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys . Pam 's characters in her other Blaxploitation films , do n't stoop as low to get revenge , as Coffy did . < br /><br />I'd say , only watch Coffy , if you 're unable to see any of Pam Grier 's other films . Otherwise , Coffy is a waste of time . Only Pam 's talent as an actress , makes viewing Coffy bearable .
0 Far from providing the caffeine kick you 'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy - boosting of warm beverages , Coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale . Indeed , if the movie was a cup of coffee , it 'd be rather weak and watery , littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste . Sporadically it hits the spot , but otherwise it is n't the hot action - drama it hopes to be.<br /><br />Plot - wise , Coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug - pushing , lady - pimpin ' , mob - suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved , sick state . Socio - political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in America is prominent in Coffy , and it makes for some thought - provoking stuff as Coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted Afro - American minorities . Sadly , the timely messages are undermined by the film 's poor quality and lack of focus . Coffy 's ideas are important , it 's just that they are not well - aimed.<br /><br />One of the plus points of Coffy is the presence of Blaxploitation icon Pam Grier . Grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence ( how do you deal with a house full of hoods ? Drive the car right through the front door ! ) . It 's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions , wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible . The low budget ca n't have helped , but neither does the fact that for a Blaxploitation flick , Coffy lacks groove . Just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality , consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection.<br /><br />The total result is workmanlike and wooden . We get a hip heroine but not a hip movie . It 's a shame as Coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the Blaxploitation craze ; it just never ascends above being an average , lukewarm number .
0 Poorly - made " blaxploitation " crime - drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s . Pam Grier stars in the title role , that of a nurse who becomes a one - woman vigilante after drug - dealing thugs make Coffy 's little sister a junkie . Violent nonsense plods along doggedly , with canned energy and excitement ; only Grier 's flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt ( she 's not much of an actress here , but she connects with the audience in a primal way ) . Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time , the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner - city audience . Today however , it 's merely a footnote in ' 70s film history , and lacks the wide - range appeal of other movies in this genre . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written , and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller , also author of Bridges of Madison County . The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible . A failing couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong , self - directed criminal , and after a few adventures ( mostly terrifically violent ) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin , she leaves the impotent partner for the killer , who , bad as he is , sees her more clearly than anyone has before . Nothing can help this movie succeed , not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer , not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz , and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down . A serious waste of time .
0 An OK flick , set in Mexico , about a hit - man ( Scott Glenn ) who hitches a ride with struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a hit . He pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand.<br /><br />It starts well enough , but quickly struggles and dies.<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />The eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe . An absence of passion , and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other , made it ridiculous - and the ending was predictable and dull.<br /><br />**END SPOILER**<br /><br />Harvey Keitel is the US agent on the hit - man 's trail , but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is ...
0 Terrible ! ! ! I do n't want to be too negative but this film has an IQ of stupid monkey . What a disaster . I just could n't believe how bad this movie is . The dialogs are just very strange and off topic , the camera work at times just horrible , the music at times like a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia , I just watched this film to see how much worse it can get . Some of the side kick " actors " are total disaster . Sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground . Harvey Keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film . . . . . this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
0 It 's not a terrible movie , really , and Glenn and Keitel are top - notch actors . Further , they do an acceptable job with the very weak script . The scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists . Further , I umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film , they are professionals and they get paid for it . But I do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then do n't release it for theater audiences ? Even if a film is a box - office flop , surely it makes some money . If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn , rent the video or catch it on TV , as did I. Granted , the movie wo n't help solve the immigration quandary with Mexico , but the experience is far better than 90 % of the standard TV fare of today .
0 Are we talking about the same movie ? This movie is totally ridiculous , the plot is disgusting and completely without logic . Its a typical straight to DVD / TV - movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience : Over - acting by has been actors , side steps from the plot that are left unexplained , THE GIRL SHOWS HER T*ts(why , god , why ? ? ) , people do not react to things as they would in real life . I 'm not even gon na bother you with details , it would take all night . Well , OK , just one : If two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street , one of the victims practically dies in your arms , his blood spurts from his head - wound all over you , would your first concern be ; " Oh , he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face ! " ? My thoughts goes to Harvey and his lost career .
0 Saw this movie recently and had higher hopes . Not so much based upon the director , who had n't made a cinematographic release before , but more based upon its cast . Harvey Keitel , Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson ( lead role in Body double , a Brian De Palma masterpiece ) have all starred in great movies . Not together though , and this fact has n't exactly changed because of this one.<br /><br />The film is unbelievable , very predictable and cliché . The only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it 's been shot . In my humble opinion : do n't waste your time on this one .
0 One of the worst movies I ever saw . My only thought was : " how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video " . This is no way worth four dollars , or any dollars . I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican , or Vin Diesel 's movies , but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />The acting was terrible , I felt sorry for the actors that they could n't find something better to do with their time . The story was ridiculous . We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors , it was so predictable . The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated , worse than a cartoon . < br /><br />Skip it .
0 Lucky me ! I got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot - in - Texas ' horror ' flick from Artisan Entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you ... I've rarely laughed so hard in my life as I did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of ' worst killer clown movie ever made ' from the insufferably stupid Full Moon fiasco KILLJOY ( I 'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one ! ) From all indications , it was shot on DV , and it does n't really ' look ' all that bad quality - wise for digital , but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts!<br /><br />The story ( slight and cliche as it is ) goes as follows ... An executive ( Ken Hebert , who also scripted and co - produced with the director ) takes skeptical co - worker Tracy ( Amanda Watson ) and horny married couple Mark and Susan ( Hank Fields and Chris Buck ) along on a weekend getaway to a ( yawn ) secluded cabin ` 12 miles ' from the nearest town . On the way there , they pick up a bitchy / slutty hitchhiker ( Melissa Bale ) in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity - yackin , pot - smokin friends ' disappears one - by - one , with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates.<br /><br />The killer clown does n't even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box ( aside from being morbidly obese ) . It basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods , chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes . I can not say enough bad things about the cast , especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick , who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times . Does n't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense , originality , intelligence , general coherence or humor . I could go on for days on how inept this film is , how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is , but I 'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that Boy - This - Sucks kind of way.<br /><br />Also noting that the film has been released here in the US as S.I.C.K. ( SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER ) . It 's currently catalogued under its ( original title ) of GRIM WEEKEND.<br /><br />Score : 1 out of 10
0 This was , so far , the worst movie I have seen in my entire life , and I have seen some REALLY bad movies . I saw this movie at my local video store , and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie . Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie . Where to start ? The filming of the movie was scattered and boring . At one point , there is a one - minute scene of no one talking , just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day . Nothing happened , they just drove in silence . The whole movie is boring , with annoying , unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of . If you rent this movie , watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy . Otherwise , when you see this movie , run .
0 Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them , trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs . S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror - but - funny movie we 've rented . The plot is over - done , the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old . The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat . And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life , it 's pathetic . The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot , one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie . The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry . I do n't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos , I do n't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting . Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone 's downfalls I would recommend it.<br /><br />If your renting / buying it to laugh at it I 'd give it an 8.5 .
0 S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself . There was absolutely no acting to speak of . The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box . The budgeting of this movie was sufficient . The filming was sub sesame street . The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits . The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store . The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh . If there is a book out there for this movie I 'm sure it 's better . I would avoid this at all costs . I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it . just kidding .
0 OK i own this DVD i got it new at amazon ... i mean i think its badass and a pretty cool flick and melissa bale the slutty / bitchy girl they pick up is hot as hell ... , the acting sucks and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its OK i would n't recommend it if like u wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard days work but if u have nothing else to do and ur obbsessed with this stupid movies like i am , watch it sometime , and i do not know how artisan DVD has S.I.C.K. in its DVD collection , s.i.c.k . is not good enough to be owned by a half way decent movie company OK well that s all
0 What did I just watch ? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies I 've ever seen . The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns .... but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre . I still am wondering how the character Mark was n't able to run away from the Clown ... he 's 300 pounds , he 's got ta get tired eventually . The whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud " What did I just watch ? " Apparently Brandon is Denise 's cousin .... and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin ..... yeah that 's something people want so see * shudders*.<br /><br />Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says " What did you do ? " Well bytch , what do you think he just did ? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch - hiker and calling her a c*nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence is n't helping anything .... did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy ? None of this movie makes sense anyway.<br /><br />The movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which I got sucked into buying ( all 3.99)and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes . I 'm surprised the fat clown did n't join the orgy , would have fit right in . I hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other B movies might have , but I was wrong . This is a moronic piece of garbage that 's not even worth watching.<br /><br />1 out of 10
0 Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you . And if you 're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at : this is n't it . Usually I will go for stupid if it 's funny , but this stupid was so stupid it almost ( or possibly did ) make me stupid.<br /><br />The film quality is better than a handheld , but not by much , and it 's quite possible the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard . These problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing ( weep ) cast , and you have a real humdinger.<br /><br />The story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend . He also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office . On the way there they meet a female in distress , who is then invited to come along by the other girls.<br /><br />The stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone 's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.<br /><br />From there you ( the audience ) and the morons , um , actors , try to figure out what 's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another . Overall I think I have made it sound better than it is . The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped , the plot contrived , the acting bad and the motivations clueless . Once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas , it is not.<br /><br />The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway . Please do n't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie . ( Woah , my nose just grew eight inches . )
0 I rented this movie roughly 4 - 5 years ago and was instantly disappointed.<br /><br />I wanted to see a b - movie slasher flick , but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes . The acting was similar to watching grass dry . I 've seen better acting in a softcore film ... <br /><br />The idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me . How was this a horror movie?<br /><br />this movie 's production value , was laughable at best . There were no scares . It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas . The plot was all over the place , if existent . If you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent , skip this one . There are much better b - movies out there .
0 If this film was a comedy , I would have given it a 10 . Oh my , where do I begin ? Put it this way -- I 've seen lots of terrible horror films , but this one makes Troll 2 look like freakin ' Saving Private Ryan . It 's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film , changed their mind in midproduction and decided to do a comedy , then went back to horror , and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno ( softcore at that ) . Everything about this film is simply terrible : the musical score ( someone shoot the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard ) , the script , the directing , the cinematography , the acting . There simply are no words to describe this . Oh wait , yes there are : Holy $ * % ! .
0 I do n't know what you guys are talking about , the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends we could n't stop crying . This is one of the funniest shits I 've ever seen . That comment about the porn is so right though hahahaha.<br /><br />Yeah this movie actually is the worse , but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters , poor dialog and acting . Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it ? ! It looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed . class . The props look like they came out of a high school drama show . The music sounds like it is from an original Nintendo system game . The only thing that even came close the scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which , who is n't creeped out by fat , lurking clowns ? hahaha if someone were to ever watch this though , they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like lisping on words and some of their facial expressions . hahahaha I died.<br /><br />SUSAN
0 This is quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen . Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too ( After buying this and the movie " Malevolence " which I reviewed on here as well , I have learned my lesson ) . I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm . This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director 's backyard . The production was probably the worst I ever seen . The actors were absolutely the WORST . The story did n't have anything to do with what the back cover said . I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other " mom and pop " store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it . That s how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was . I have seen some bad movies before ( Troll 2 for example ) but this definitely takes the cake . I did n't think there was a worse movie than " Troll 2 " . Boy was I wrong ! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what I am about to do ! ! ! !
0 I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p . The guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh*t , but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p*ss poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a hotel room home video . Talking of home videos , since when has it been fair game to release them as films - I mean to say , films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame - o ideas together for the weekend , lavish the production with an £ 8.00 budget , and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard ( the soundtrack ) - then slap it on the shelves , for some poor sap ( me ) , to take home in lonely desperation . But here 's the clincher - I fast forwarded through most of this , and tossed it to one side , ready for the hammers ... until the next night , while watching a Darren Day horror ' Hellbreed ' ( £ 1.99 to take home and keep from a different Blockbuster ) . Now this film made ' Grim Weekend ' look like The Exorcist , so I slapped Grim Weekend back on , to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful IMDb boards , that viewers claimed were hilarious . Sure enough , once I had got over the misery , the pain , and the horror , of realising Grim Weekend was utter chod on toast , I could enjoy , savour , and downright get down to the funny stuff . And there 's a lot of it . Check the boards . Then check the flick . Hell , it might even be worth it . AWWWWW CRAP !
0 OK , so I rented this clown - like - Chainsaw - Massacre - esquire film , not expected much , but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film . ( from the back of the box is the following synopsis ) " At first , it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods . But when they began to disappear one - by - one , replaced by scattered , bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies , the remaining few scramble for their lives . But he 's out there . And he 's sick . And all he wants is blood ... " So obviously from the get - go it does n't make sense : why is this clown in the woods to begin with ? Why a clown ? Why are their dolls with the word " food " drawn on them ? Why why why ? Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min . bore fest except where this clown lives . The characters are dumb guys , dumb girls , and a hell of a lot of bitchiness . One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road , whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew . What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin ? She , of course , begins planting seeds of jealousy , having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear.<br /><br />The music was an average affair ( standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences ) . The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything . The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date , but of course , she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him . There was hardly a budget spent of anything , it seems , but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $ 1-store dolls lying around in the woods , which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie ( been done too many times ) . I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film ( in through the glass maybe ) , but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film . I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.<br /><br />I had to give the film a 3 . It was an interesting premise ( clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character , essentially ) and I 'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could 've totally been a B - movie - style video , but they opted for the more legitimate style of video . But ultimately , I probably would 've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out . Ah , but that cover art ... pretty awesome drawing .
0 This movie was so bad ! It was terrible ! It was awful ! I can not stress it enough ! The acting , directing , story , characters and everything about it was bad ! It was so corny and clichéd . Do n't be fooled by the cover , or the tag line " The ' texas massacre ' is nothing to laugh at . " Are you frogging ' kidding me ! It was ridiculous.<br /><br />The first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character Brendan , OK now turn it off . What I got from the film was , A bunch of ugly , annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways.<br /><br />This movie was a waste of my time and money , and it would be a waste of your money and time too ! I fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible , I just wanted to see how each bad actor died , and it STILL was n't worth it ! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time . This IS seriously THE worst movie EVER ! Rating : does n't deserve one .
0 Well ... overall , this movie was pretty much worthless , and it 's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy . I just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie . This definitely was n't what we were looking for , but it satisfied us for humor . The actors in this movie ( especially Brandon ) are so fake that it 's funny . And especially that Tracy girl whenever she 's in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away . They show almost no emotion and it 's just so obvious that they 're acting . And also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs Mark , he does n't even look like he 's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him . And seriously , would you just be JOGGING if you were being chased down ? I 'd be sprinting for my life ! ( Even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he 's like 300 lbs . ) Not to mention that the effects are n't that great , like whenever the clown chops off Susan 's head in the forest , then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws the head back over . Also like in the previous guy 's comment , the beginning makes absolutely NO sense and I do n't even see why it was even included in the movie . So what , was this movie made in 2003 ? The music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980 's , and the camera - ing ( ? ) does n't even really look professional . Half of the time , it seems like the camera ca n't even stay steady when it 's suppose to be . Overall , I 'd have to say I enjoyed the movie . I would n't recommend it though if you 're trying to find something to scare you , but if you 're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of , I 'd recommend it for sure .
0 This was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen . I am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie . In fact , when I 'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies . They are always good for a laugh , believe i know , i have seen many . But this movie was just so terrible it was n't worth a chuckle . I was considering turning it off in the first five minutes ... which i probably should have . There is nothing good about it , first and foremost , the camera crew suck3d A$ $ . The intro was stupid just like the ending . Acting and special effects were terrible . Please I 'm begging you , do NOT watch this movie , you will absolutely hate it .
0 Worst movie on earth . I do n't even know where to begin but I hope I can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie . When it comes to acting and lighting , this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex . The actors are some of the worst I 've ever seen , and could n't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie . The movie must have had a record breaking low budget which I 'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie 's cover . This movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies . I would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare . I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment I put us through . Do n't see this movie !
0 The cover on the DVD and disc is freaking awesome , you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea , but this movie 's actors are worst then Ben 's performance in pearl harbor , porno 's have better quality and better actors . i was gon na buy the DVD but luckily i rented it first , the plot and script are also horrible , nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense . The poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80 's sitcom shows and in the end it 'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house .
0 OK - I ADORE this film ... I will credit this movie - alone - for making me such a die - hard horror fanatic . I could never watch this movie alone . I 've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it 's original release at the theatres , on its viewers . Incredible masterpiece .... Horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me .Oh bless their hearts , whoever made this awesome film . I love it . I thought the whole film was decent and interesting . This movie is SO scary - this is the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life ! Not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was Brendan 's fabulous acting . Best horror film EVER . Nothing can ever be this scary again . Halloween viewing at its evilest .
0 Hey everyone ... <br /><br />There really is n't much to say for this movie at all . The basic plot is that a guy ( Brandon ) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work . After picking up a girl on the way there , things start going badly wrong for all of them.<br /><br />The storyline alone ( written by the actor playing Brandon , I believe , although I could be wrong here ) is unlikely and unconvincing , and is acted out accordingly . The " Clown Killer " himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer . Far from being a dark , mysterious but most of all , intelligent predator , we are instead offered a rather clumsy , nursery rhyme - singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis . The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film ( the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things).<br /><br />In short , this film falls below every possible set standard . Admittedly , I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this , so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating . However , in reality , ( and with the benefit of hindsight ) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.<br /><br />1 star out of ten .
0 this movie was definitely the worst movie i 've seen in my entire life , and i 've seen some pretty bad movies . i did n't like the way this movie was filmed . all of the actors are unknown , and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie . but it 's absolutely horrible . i 've never seen a worse movie . the story is so fake , and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie . there was no plot , it looked as though it was n't planned out before they started filming . the story is too weird . i did n't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie . there was no point in even filming this movie . if you 're considering watching this movie , do n't . you 're just wasting your time .
0 I rented this film about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night . All I can say to describe this worthless film is ' TRASH ' The acting is so badly done I 've seen kids in high school do a better job The whole cast seems like they 're just reading their lines out , no feeling , no emotion , and no room to capture the viewer . On another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack.<br /><br />The clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover . Heck he does n't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters . There is no real murder shown either so this is n't a real slasher film either Since I 've seen it I 've questioned a few things 1 . If is ' Serial Insane Clown Killer ' Would n't that be a Serial Killer who kills clowns ? 2 . If your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her ? Sad really.<br /><br />3 . Why is it that the only REAL acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden ? Did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs ? This film is as sad as they come . My advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming .
0 This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen . To begin , I 'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading , if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown , you are soooo wrong . In fact the killers face does n't even slightly resemble the front cover , it 's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool . Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool , there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods , then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it 's young in a glisten of sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ? ? ? How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through ? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining , if it was n't horror then at least it would be funny right ? WRONG ! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named S.I.C.K < br /><br />Bottom line is : Do n't SEE THIS FILM ! ! !
0 Me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good . But we were wrong . First of the acting .... wow ... the acting was the worst , the effects were really bad as well , it seemed like a film a college kid made . The plot was pretty good , but it 'd been done . The thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors . The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it 's a shame I 'm even calling him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh see it .... but other than that ... stay far away from this one . I usually love B list movies and such , but this one ... I do not know how it was passed to even be put on video ... this one is the worst I 've seen .. and I 've seen some bad ones .
0 I have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life , a lot , but this is without a doubt the worst one ever ! I usually like dumb movies , if they are somewhat entertaining , but I ca n't even think of one good thing about this movie . I like " Teen Witch " for Heaven 's sake . But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting , lame porn music throughout the whole thing , and even the sex scenes sucked ! I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of " Twin Dragons " , " Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys " or even " a Very Brady Sequel " . Although , this is by far worse then any of those . I beg you , do n't even waste your time . Believe me , its 2 hours you 'll never get back .
0 I am writing this review having watched it several months ago .... the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie . It is a complete joke .... and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art . The producer who played Brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers .... hell he might not even be good at that either ! The lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you could n't even see the actor 's faces sometimes . I do n't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really , bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable . That 's all the time I will waste on this review PLEASE stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents do n't do it buy s piece of gum at least IT would keep you entertained!<br /><br />If you want good quality low budget fun , far better than this ... then check out a Jeff Hayes film .... because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it!<br /><br />I gave this 1 star just for the cover art .... thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called " film" < br /><br />-Rick Blalock
0 This movie is just horrible . It 's boring , it 's low quality , the actors are just the worst actors I have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it 's hilarious.<br /><br />The " main " actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls , but he 's ugly , overweight and looks like he 's from the early 90's.<br /><br />All the characters are away for the week - end for a get together amongst friends , but nobody are actually friends ! The married couple has n't seen the " main " guy in over 5 years and even back then they were n't really friends . The " date " of the main guy only knows him from work and than there 's a girl they pick - up at a bar . Now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week - end at your cabin with people that are n't even your real friends . Because that 's what he does at the beginning of the movie!<br /><br />Do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon . I 've made home movies scarier than this!<br /><br / >
0 Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that ... <br /><br />I would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10 . Where to begin , we 'll start from the top ... <br /><br />THE STORY : Do n't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars , and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are . It 's a draub , basic , go to cabin movie with no intensity or " effort".<br /><br />THE SCREENPLAY : I usually give credit to indie screenwriters , it 's hard work when you are starting out ... but this is crap . The story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie . The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of " Woah , you totally freaked me out " and " I was wondering if you 'd uh ... if you 'd like to .. uh , would you come to the cabin with me ? " . It makes me want to rip out all my hair , one strand at a time and feed it to myself.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERS : HOLY CRAP ! ! ! ! Some have described the characters as flat , I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch .. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards ... <br /><br />THE ACTORS : Worse than the characters are the actors . They take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting . The " Woah you totally freaked me out " was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down . I could complain for hours on the actors alone.<br /><br />TECHNICAL : LIGHTING : An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie . Too shadowy in areas , too bleached in others . The director should n't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly . Baby Steps ! SOUND : How many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie ? 9 . With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured . There is one scene in particular that really sticks out , these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle .... WEAK ! CAMERA : Learn to use it.<br /><br />Anyway , I 'm running out of complaining space ..... rent it - I dare you ... Rent it and learn from it ... give it a 1 rating .. it deserves it.<br /><br />Signing off ... Amanda Christmas
0 Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst film ever made . Probably in the style of Ed Wood(without the heart ) . The lightning is terrible . The music is very bad(piano and orgue ... come on ! ) . The acting is ... well there is no acting!<br /><br />There 's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.<br /><br />The killer is a fat , unscary clown who could n't outrun a turtle!<br /><br />Every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort.<br /><br />The end is so far the most stupid ever made . Think about it : The guy(ken hebert ) who 's acting skill is about the same as his writing(he 's the brain behind this flop ) invite a co - worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week - end and kills them ... On monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.<br /><br />The tragedy is that Mr . Hebert try to make us beleive that it 's a family affair that goes on for generation(his uncle is the clown killer)<br /><br />So of course NO cops are gon na question him after his co - worker goes missing ... <br /><br />WHATEVER.<br /><br / >
0 While I watched this movie , I tried to figure out why they bothered making it . Though the main plot of the movie is potentially good , there are all sorts of unrelated / unnecessary subplots . The marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys , perpetual double - crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex . It 's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the President and his mistress . The many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - I really did n't feel like I knew any character , except that everyone is corrupt and evil . The ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been , but what was supposed to be . In the end , there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do , except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double - cross . I 'm surprised that so many established ( and good ) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie . This seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.<br /><br />Don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie .
0 The banner says it all , this is one really bad movie , which is sad because I normally like Sheffer , and I have been impressed with Andrea Roth in other roles . This , however , is terrible . I wo nt waste any more time ... its just that bad .
0 I gave this a 1 . There are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for . Total mayhem . Everyone gets killed or nearly so . I am tired of cross hairs and changing views . I can not give the plot away . Convoluted and insane . If I had paid to see this I would demand my money back . I wish reviews were more honest .
0 Normally , I am a pretty generous critic , but in the case of this film I have to say it was incredibly bad . I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.<br /><br />There were some gorgeous shots , but it 's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie . It might have worked if " Daggers " was purely an action flick and not a romance , but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle . There is no chemistry between either of the couples , whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love , and for the most part the dialogue is just silly . This may be just a problem with translation , but the frequent usage of the word " flirt " in particular reminded me of 8th grade , not head - over - heels , together forever , worth - dying - for love ; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor . The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about , and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole . I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward , I was slumped in my seat ready to snore , but mostly I just cringed a lot.<br /><br />*******spoiler*****<br /><br />Now , the icing on the cake . Or rather , adding insult to injury . The ending was truly one of the most horrible , laughable ones I have ever seen . The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other . Oh , and then it starts to snow . Randomly . Oh , and then Mei ( dagger embedded in heart ) suddenly pops up out of the weeds . Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it 's destination , even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet . Wow , cool.<br /><br />Well , then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death . Jin sings , sobs , holds her body close , screen goes blank . I , and the people surrounding me , are chuckling . Not a good sign.<br /><br />Visually stunning , but ultimately a failure .
0 I was very surprised how bad this movie was . Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far . I was hoping for a rerun of Hero , but this is much , much worse.<br /><br />This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place . No believable characters ( even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies , these characters are ridiculous ) , virtually no plot , and ridiculous story twists.<br /><br />This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child . Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense , they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ( " Ah ha , you only think you 've got me with your super powers and 10,000 ray guns , but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon , so your ray guns do n't work and I 'm invulnerable to your super powers .... tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one . " ) Children can continue with this lunacy , because they do n't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time . However , for the VIEWER , especially the adult viewer , this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu movie makers , ( a ) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP , in which case your kung fu is not strong , ( b ) if you repeatedly fall on your back , which has a knife in it , it will hurt more and do more damage , unless it is a fake prop , ( c ) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife , you die , especially in ancient china where there is n't a Kaiser Permanente around the corner , ( d ) kung fu fights do n't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls , and ( e ) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations.<br /><br />In any event , go watch Hero again , because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible .
0 As someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of " Hero , " I was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines , but better . It also featured an actress I like : Ziyi Zhang . Well , I was disappointed on both counts . I bought the DVD of this film sight - unseen , and that was a mistake . It was not better.<br /><br />I realize these flying - through - the - air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief . A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents ? Sorry , that 's going a little far . Also , the major male character ' Jin " ( Takeshi Kaneshiro ) was so annoying with his dialog , stupid look on his face and stupid laugh , that he ruined the film , too.<br /><br />Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes , this story - to me - just did n't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning . This film is no " Hero " of mine !
0 After just 15 minutes into this film , I began to miss Zhang Yimou 's earlier , more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of China from unique perspectives . His turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion . Hero was his worst film since Operation Cougar , with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a John Agar film . Shi Mian Mai Fu is no different . As an American who has been studying Chinese films for a few years now ( and understands and can speak some Mandarin ) , I 'm sure my opinion is different from many others as I 'm coming from a different background . SMMF , like Hero , is not really a traditional a kung fu film , and it 's certainly not a wuxia pian film . There are no sword & sorcery or chivalry elements here . This is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as A Chinese Ghost Story ( all 3 ) , The Butterfly Murders , Green Snake , et al . While those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do , SMMF features bland , and sometimes laughable , dialogue combined with cardboard acting . Zhang Ziyi plays a blind person about as well as Ben Affleck . There 's an air of superiority with this film that 's really quite insulting . It takes itself so seriously , it just becomes a huge joke by the end . All the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history , they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions , and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if Zhang Yimou was making a film per se , or simply a showcase ( i.e. an " ego booster " ) for Zhang Ziyi . The camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film . Her acting range really has n't extended past her ability to play a naive " w"itch . She 's so concentrated on her acting , she comes across as cold and lifeless , as though she 's reading her lines from a notecard . It 's so funny to hear American critics and film people ( like the completely clueless Quentin Tarantino ) call this film a masterpiece . I guess if they see a bunch of Asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest , they 're tricked into thinking it 's brilliant film - making . Ching Siu Tung 's choreography , while still retaining his trademark style , editing , and postures , lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like A Chinese Ghost Story , Dragon Inn , and Duel to the Death . Sadly to say , the wirework in this film is really subpar , and if there 's subpar / obvious wirework , then you probably should n't have filmed it at high speed . The same goes for the special effects which have a distinct B - movie feel to them . Beans , daggers , bowls , arrows , swords , and other random objects fly through the air ( after being thrown ) with no regard for logic , turning , climbing , and banking as though there 's a little pilot inside . I know that logic does n't really hold a place in stylized Chinese martial arts films , but if you do n't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience , then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more . Mass melodrama , unintentionally funny dramatic moments , boring fight scenes , really uninspired plot twists are what await you with Shi Mian Mai Fu . It 's obvious that Zhang Yimou is no longer making movies for Chinese audiences . This is meant to crack into the Western market just as CTHD did . After watching Hero and SMMF , I 've come to the conclusion that if Zhang Yimou wants to make Hollywood films , he 's definitely off to the right start . SMMF is basically The Phantom Menace of Chinese martial arts films . And I thought Hero was bad .
0 First of all , I too was expecting another Hero -- a fantastic work of art for the action genre . I 've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon , but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD.<br /><br />Basic elements from Hero are found in HoFD : Great landscapes , mesmerizing cinematography , and sincere acting ( I mean , if you ca n't understand a word they are saying , without the subtitles , but you still care -- that 's good acting)<br /><br />What went wrong ? What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story . Worse , it 's a soap opera - like love triangle . You have three characters who , I guess , fall in love with each other- for no good reasons . This movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail ( I fell asleep about forty minutes into it ) . It 's almost as if they changed writers at that point . The remainder of the movie is about how a character is " like the wind . " Ick . Also , you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces . This is n't unique to this genre , but since the story is weak , you ca n't wait for the action , and then , when the fighting does breaks out , it really was n't that good . The beginning grabs you , but then this movie just runs out of gas .
0 i ca n't believe that NONE of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes . It 's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent . My biggest problem with the movie is that it does n't seem to condemn these assaults - as in , the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions , and neither does anyone else . One man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him , but he is reprimanded only with " you can not force a woman to love you " rather than " you should never force a woman sexually , you jerk " ... From a woman 's point of view , the movie is a let down . It sort of " throws a bone " to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders , but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power , with men dominating the woman they love . This amazing martial arts fighter does n't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers . She never even makes them apologize - rather , SHE seems apologetic . Overall , a depressing and upsetting movie , with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes , but not as good as Hero by a long shot .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />Long time inmate Twitch ( Kurupt ) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re - opened Alcatraz . He claims it 's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose . There he crosses paths with Burke ( Bill Goldberg ) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself . Twitch , despite being less muscular , is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same . But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black 's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke . But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics , Cortez ( Robert Madrid ) takes Twitch 's girlfriend and Burke 's daughter hostage.<br /><br />Steven Seagal does n't do sequels ( reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie ) so despite this being a DVD sequel , the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg ( Steve does n't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end . ) But there 's a reason he has n't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that 's because he 's not much of an actor , and not much of an action star either , managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one - liners . Support wise , veterans from the first film , Kurupt and Tony Plana , have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />This is a film that 's tried to copy the style of the original quite well , with the dim lighting , dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it . It does this quite well , unfortunately it ca n't contend with an unengaging hero , an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along . * *
0 for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie , heres your chance , and then get back to the real world.<br /><br />The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch , so he gets transferred to another prison , where wrestling champs hang around looking broody . Twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman.<br /><br />Then something happens and someone gets shot , and the film turns into Die Hard in another prison . But the wrestler 's daughter is caught up in it all , so he and twitch go to find her and Twitch 's woman.<br /><br />As you can imagine , the acting is below par , it features a lot of ( really annoying ) rap music , and poorly edited fight scenes . On the plus side , it 's got that Hispanic bloke in it , who stars in every prison / action / thriller ever made , and he shuts a door in this.<br /><br />It 's not very eventful , but at least it 's harmless.<br /><br />If you were a massive fan of the original , it 's okay - ish stuff.<br /><br />If not , you have been warned .
0 Half Past Dead , starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B - hit . Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct - to - video sequel , an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something . It 's less entertaining than the first one : in all aspects . But it 's although worthy a look . If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session ; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels , even if they are direct or not.<br /><br />Kurupt did a good job , Bill Goldberg was below the average , I think he is n't made to the job . Kurupt is a good comedian , I say . The rest did the job , but nothing amazing , nothing far from alright.<br /><br />Technical details , well , a production made by Sony ca n't be great . Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable . Whatever , just watch it if you want . If you watch , you wo n't lose anything . But if you do n't ... well , you wo n't lose either .
0 WOW ! Why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film ? Half Past Dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be . HPD2 has no clue of what it wants to be . It just exists on screen for reasons I ca nt explain . Spoiler : The whole movie is this : Twitch(played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound ) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried . In the jail , a riot breaks out between rival inmates , one of them gets shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape . During a conjugal visit , Twitch 's fiancée and Burke's(played by Bill Goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by Cortez and are held in an execution room . Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that Cortez has their loved ones.<br /><br />Opinion : This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier : The Return . The script is terrible , the acting is horrendous , the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature . Look , I know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do . Nobody in this " movie " believes in the characters they play . Nobody in this " movie can be taken seriously as an actor . Kurupt should be ashamed of himself . His character " Twitch " is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by Burke or the other inmates . Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a PHD(pretty huge dump ) . The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when action is happening ! Do n't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent . It stinks and is a prime reason why people despise Follywood .
0 OK first of all let me say that i 'm still amazed of how the plot sucks,<br /><br />but than again its a movie that sequels a Steven segal movie only with no Steven segal omg!!!<br /><br />just random low budget action scenes really no point i ' m still amazed i burned 90 min on this crap really ! ! < br /><br />just rent a Jacky Chan movie or go see wwf more fun and has no and presume not to have and plot ! ! ! plz plz plz avoid it ! ! btw the best actor playing there is bill goldberg and that says a lot!!<br /><br />and no he does n't play very well like i said plz avoid it pfff i still ca nt believe i wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this ! ! :)
0 Considering that I felt like picking up a new Jet Li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting , I grabbed this title.<br /><br />Unfortunatly , this movie contains more gun battles ( ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good ) , than Jet Li and company 's acrobatic fighting . Thus it was a let down.<br /><br />The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny , considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me , more on the line of say Jackie Chan.<br /><br />But alas I 'd recommend Fist of Legend , Tai Chi Master , or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment.<br /><br />Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie score
0 Man , even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie . This flick does n't have enough plot for half an hour , yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour . Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good , specially in those exaggerated fight scenes , but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade .
0 I do n't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site ! I 'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this Showtime original film bastardized beyond belief , but even if I was n't , the poor acting , VERY poor casting ( Sean Astin as the brilliant , athletic , and all around individual , Harrison ? ? The guy 's completely generic ! ) and sub - standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable . Someone pointed out how cute that Maculay Culkin line was . If you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance ( sadly , it probably was the most INTENTIONALLY funny part of the movie ) , maybe you 'll like this movie . But if you 're a Vonnegut fan or not completely insane , do n't see it . Please .
0 This movie is unworthy of the Omen title . It is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three . It never should have been made , they ought to change the title.<br /><br />They do n't even spell Damien Thorn 's NAME correctly ! ! ! ! And there are no daggers , the most important element of all the Omen films . Pull it from the shelves and burn it .
0 Only the Antichrist could have been behind such a disaster . One only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the " film " ! This movie was so bad , it forced me to register with IMDb , finally , just so I could trash it . What makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such GREAT source material ! I have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />It may seem insignificant , but I 'd like to start with the score . As the proud owner of a music degree , I must register my indignation ! I was torn between laughter and dry heaves as I listened to what John Scheffer did to Goldsmith 's brilliant score ; it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes , and almost as inadvertently comedic . It was by far the most inappropriate score I 've heard since , well , I really ca n't think of a worse one . Maybe JAWS 4?<br /><br />As for the plot ... I 'm sorry . New Age mysticism ? ? ? What ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy ? In those films ( more so in the first two than the third , but still ! ! ) the supernatural was for the most part implied , and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable . Here we have crystals going black ( calling all Skeksis and Mystics ! ! ) and inverted crucifixes galore , even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle . Gone is the refined psychlogical manipulation tapping the malaise inherent in our collective psyche : in its place a boorish " slap in the face " of recycled cliché and transparent incompetence . Add to that a lead " actress " so unbelievably ANNOYING that you fervently thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent . Never have I seen a little girl so fundamentally irritating since little Stephanie ruined ALL IN THE FAMILY.<br /><br />Other than that , I have no strong feelings on the subject ;-) Luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this train - wreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or , at the very most , a study in how NOT to make a film . Viewer beware ! May induce vomiting if you 're lucky .
0 honestly , i do n't know what 's funnier , this horrific remake , or the comments on this board . Masterpiece 's review had me in tears , that 's so funny . Anyway , this movie is the among the worst movies ever , and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels . The " Omen " name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO , but it 's a slap in the face to the other three , especially the original . There are so many classically bad moments , but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair ! ! good times ! This movie is to the Omen series what " Scary Movie " is to the entire genre . Avoid unless you 're looking for a good laugh .
0 As with many other pop - culture franchise series , this line just did n't know when to quit . Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended , they went on to generate this ; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark.<br /><br />This movie should never have happened . It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line , and it sure shows . The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same.<br /><br />After the wonderful experience which was The Omen , this was a major disappointment which stank of 70 's cheese and horrible acting . It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects , and left a terrible , lingering stench long after it was over . < br /><br />It rates a 1.4/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it ... or me . It is not a good movie . Terrible in fact . But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away . It would have made a great MST3 K subject!<br /><br />Most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here : bad dialogue , inappropriate music , contrived plot sequences , ridiculous pseudoscience . You 'll thrill to slo - mo death sequences , the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom , facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths . Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off , but WHO 'S SHOT ? Both look at themselves , then the other , then themselves , then ( seemingly 15 minutes later ) , one finally goes down . You 'll sing along ( in latin of course ) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death's - choir that , for a moment , threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.<br /><br />So if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better , then this might be a decent choice for you . It 's not as funny as my current sci - fi schlock favorite , " They Live " featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper , but it 's more fun to watch than luke - warm movies like Omen II or III.<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 10 .
0 I saw the omen when i was 11 on tv . I enjoyed the Trilogy . So when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i did nt pass it up . I went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see was nt a cinema release but a made for TV film . However being a fan i could nt resist . But this Omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening did nt bring chills it brought laughter . Risible Dialogue such as " it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god " . What nonsense . No decent set pieces . Faye Grant so Good in V is wasted with this script from hell . No suprises and no fun . However i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was . Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
0 This is a truly wretched little film . Admittedly the original ( un)holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third , " The Final Conflict " degenerating into a ridiculous sub - plot about half - way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d'etre for the " Omen " series . But then to foist this jumped - up TV movie ( beware purchasers of the Omen box set on DVD - do n't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer , this was and is strictly small - screen stuff ) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable , particularly , endorsed as it was , by the exec.producer and producer of the first three movies Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard . I 'd give - away the plot if there was any , besides the usual death scenes ( hopelessly toned down for TV sensibilities ) and some of the worst acting I 've seen . All involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen , let alone masquerading under the Omen name . If one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess , I 'll feel better for it .
0 Omen IV ( 1991 ) was a bad made - for - T.V. movie . Since the 80 's were over , I guess the executives were experimenting in meth ( the drug of choice during the 90 's ) because there is no other reason to explain this travesty . Why did they even bother making this ? A t.v . movie ? What were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board ? Did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as . Perhaps they thought it could make it as a series ? We 'll never know . But I know one thing . This movie was the major reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy . They should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this " extra " disc.<br /><br />Omen IV is basically a average American family remake of the first film . Instead of a snot nosed punk kid , we get the spooky girl who 's a total brat to everyone around her . If the family had stronger parenting skills , then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred . These parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline ! < br /><br />Not recommended , best to avoid at all cost !
0 This sequel is a total rehash of the first film . A completely pointless movie . It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time . It even ends the same way as the first one ! The music is too busy and interfering , and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I , it 's extremely predictable . It 's not a horrible movie , it 's not terribly made , there is much worse movies out there , this just had absolutely no point in being made . The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse , even more pointless than this , so I guess it has that . If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke , I guess I 'd choose this .
0 The first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the Omen name on this movie ? It is a shambolic , embarrassing , pathetic atempt to carry on the Omen franchise . When the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from then on the film gets worse ! I do nt know who wrote the script but i bet they got a E - for it when they took it back to show their teacher ! It is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original Omen it beggers belief . The acting is laughable , especially from the leading lady Faye Grant . she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh ? It 's hard to tell . THE worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness . 1 out of 10 .
0 I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that { insert demonic music here } there is a fourth . I did n't expect much from it , and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations . If you 're into watching bad movies for a laugh , then this just may be the movie for you . Oh , where do we start?<br /><br />From the onset , the " made for TV " look and feel of the movie was obvious . The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore ( at best ) distracting . The script had all the suspense of an 8 year - olds work of fiction . But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting . Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness.<br /><br />The story itself is quite thin , centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn , adopted out by wrong - doing and badly acted nuns . There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the " drama " unfolded , and the usual third - party investigator into the whole affair . Later , via some medical phenomena , Damien Thorn Jnr is born . And that pretty much wraps up the plot . The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and/or ridiculous scene after another . < br /><br />There were many WTF ? ! ? moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief . For example , what 's with the major over - reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother 's cheek ? ? Hardly a 360-degree - head - turning omen . I also laughed at the over - reaction at the baptism . The baby cries , and everyone looks very concerned . The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself . Huh ? Then there is the new - age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year - old to all kind of alternative spiritualism . I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny 's hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it . " Yeah that 's groovy , fill my troubled 8 year old daughter 's head with all this mysticism stuff . That 's cool . I do n't need to be there . " Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack . The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way , from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia , to the ensuing inferno.<br /><br />I also laughed at how the nun 's death is considered a " freak accident " . Here we have a religious zealot , ( who is described as being part of a cult ) , who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how God 's Glory will protect them . She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times . Hardly a freak accident . More like a successful suicide attempt . < br /><br />The snakes - vs - nun scene was n't the only comical death . There is the slow - speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot . Then there is the slow - motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective . I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slow - motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the " concerned " detective . Then there is the quintessential who - shot - who cliché death , where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances . Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was . Additionally , the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me . He runs around looking at the architecture of the church . Obviously finding this quite distressing , he eventually collapses , clutching his chest and dies . Apparently something demonic was happening , as this is what the music was suggesting . Ummm . OK . < br /><br />I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and , in particularly , as a " worthy sequel " . It is difficult not to notice the non - sensical script , the unrealistic acting , and the inappropriate musical score . The movie lacks any suspense , relying heavily on Delia 's " demonic stare " to provide a sense of horror , which becomes rather annoying after a short time . < br /><br />Bottom line : This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it 's unintended potential for being a comedy .
0 To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS . I know it 's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day , but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish . So bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise . I can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push . Poor in every way , do n't con people by saying otherwise . Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries , script is likewise . Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead ( WOW ! ) do n't disguise the film - makers lack of ideas , and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares . Absolutely no redeeming qualities , utter utter turd . I 've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap . They must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film . Shame .
0 Omen IV : The Awakening starts at the ' St. Frances Orphanage ' where husband & wife Karen ( Faye Grant ) & Gene York ( Michael Woods ) are given a baby girl by Sister Yvonne ( Megan Leitch ) who they have adopted , they name her Delia . At first things go well but as the years pass & Delia ( Asia Vieria ) grows up Karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her , Karen is convinced that she is evil itself . Karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next Antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who Delia 's real father was ... <br /><br />Originally to be directed by Dominique Othenin - Girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by Jorge Montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone 's guess as Omen IV : The Awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors . The script by Brian Taggert is hilariously bad , I 'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that I find even that hard to believe . As a serious film Omen IV : The AWakening falls flat on it 's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof , I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes face - to - face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed & I thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure . Then there 's the pointless difference between this & the other Omen films in that this time it 's a young girl , the question I ask here is why ? Seriously , why ? There 's no reason at all & is n't used to any effect at all anyway . Then of course there 's the stupid twist at the end which claims Delia has been keeping her brother 's embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of Satan worshippers it has been implanted in Karen so she can give birth to the Antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft . At first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later.<br /><br />It 's obviously impossible to know how much of Omen IV : The Awakening was directed by Girard & Montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it 's a shabby , cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made - for - TV & it shows with the bland , flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design . Then there 's the total lack of scares , atmosphere , tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous Omen films so effective.<br /><br />The budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was . The best most stylish thing about Omen IV : The Awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as Delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path 's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything . I have to mention the music which sounds awful , more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding . The acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys.<br /><br />Omen IV : The Awakening is rubbish , it 's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid . The change of director 's probably did n't help either , that 's still not a excuse though . The last Omen film to date following the original The Omen ( 1976 ) , Damien : Omen II ( 1978 ) & The Final Conflict ( 1981 ) all of which are far superior to this .
0 Well since seeing part 's 1 through 3 I can honestly say that they should have NEVER made part 4 . Everything from the tacky , and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting , I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds.<br /><br />I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion , but without him around in this one it 's just not the same . Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story line 's , but it was a good closure at the end of the third one . Again there was no reason for a part 4 . Even if there was they could have done a MUCH better job than this sh*t I had to sit through , lol . There goes an hour and a half of my life i 'll never see again .
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * Like some evil Tinkers - to - Evers - to - Chance double - play combination we have in " Omen IV " the evil seed of the deceased AntiChrist Damien Thorn come back . Terrorizing his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the entire world as a she named Delia York , Asia Vieila . After being given to a " deserving " couple the Yorks Karen & Gene , Fay Grant & Michael Woods , by the Catholic Church 's St. Francis orphanage.<br /><br />Little Delia did n't waste any time making her peasants felt by scratching her mom at a house party . Later Delia almost get killed by a runaway truck only to have herself saved by this " Devil Dog " named Ryder . Going to school Delia takes care of the local bully by getting the big guy to wet himself in front of all his classmates . Later when his father threatens the Yorks with a law suit she has his head sliced off in a self - induced traffic accident ! Delia is someone that you never mess with if you know what 's good for you.<br /><br />Meanwhile Dalia 's dad Gene becomes a big man in town on his own , or so he thinks , by getting elected to the congress as a champion of the clean air and green trees crowd instead of letting the smog and concrete boys take over the neighborhood with his eye now on he White House itself ! Did his bratty and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York 's sudden good fortune?<br /><br />It 's only later when Jo , Ann Hearen , is hired as Delia 's nanny that the truth 's comes out about her strange and evil powers . Jo a New Age type realizes that Delia is a bit weird , after turning all her white crystals black , and calls her New Age Guru Noah , Jim Byrnes , to come over and check her out . Noah is so upset by what he sees in Delia Kirilian color vibrations , all black and blue with a little pinch of red , that it flips him out so bad that he almost crashed into Delia 's moms car.<br /><br />Taken on a trip to a psychic festival by Jo Delia turns the entire event into an inferno setting the place , through mental telepathy , on fire and heaving everyone there run for cover including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up with his leg broken . The and shaken and battered Guru was so shook up by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan wilderness . < br /><br />Jo herself is later thrown out , with the help of the sweet and cuddly family pet Ryder , of a second floor window to her death because she knew and talked too much . It 's when Karen is again pregnant that she decides , finally , to find out the truth about the real parents of Delia . That 's when she , and we in the audience , come face to face with the truth . She 's not only the feared AntiChrist of Revelations she 's his twin sister ! Her brother the AntiChrist himself is about to come on the scene as her kid brother the sill unborn Alexander York!<br /><br />Three times were more then enough for the AntiChrist coming back to earth to bring about Armageddon . The movie going public were already getting a little tired of of him and his evil adventures . With a fourth really not necessary since Daimen Thorn , the original AntiChrist , had been dead and buried for years . Were put through the usual ringer with no one believing that little Delia is " Thee " AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race . The movie as bad as it is is also far too long , 97 minutes , for a horror flick that could well have told it 's story is as little as 80 minutes.<br /><br />Having a private eye Earl Knight , Mchael Learner , and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne , Megan Lehch , and now faith healer Felichy in the film only to be killed off did n't help the plot either . It only prolonged the suffering of those of us watching the movie . You could see the surprise ending coming almost as soon as the film " Omen IV " began with the bases being cleared for Delia 's eventual takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world . What was a bit of a surprise was Delia doing it with a little help from friends .
0 After the already disappointing " Final Conflict " , the series hits rock - bottom with this very weak fourth entry . At least the third film tried ( unsuccessfully ) to continue the story of Damien , while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the " Omen " ( animals are afraid of the Antichrist , the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film ) . But what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here . And the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid .
0 and it did . It is through my experience that when a horror film reaches " franchise " status , and subsequent titles are released thereafter , they all , in turn , become stricken by one inevitable factor : irrelevance . Omen IV : The Awakening makes no exception to this rule , featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the Anti - Christ , foretold by a religious prophecy . Have n't we seen this before ? Was n't it enough that , over the span of three films prior to this release , we 've experienced the rise and fall of Damien Thorn ? If you 're a horror enthusiast such as myself , you 'll realize that it 's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy - Children of the Corn , Hellraiser , Phantasm ; the list goes on . At this point in the game , I 'm sure you know what to expect when you 're prepared to view the fourth title in a series . Regardless , there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are . Omen IV : The Awakening is just that , too - a shameless money making exercise.<br /><br />This film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the Omen lineup . As unique and genuine as Omen IV tries to be compared to its siblings , the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike . Elements like the guardian dog , the involvement of a priest , the skepticism of the people involved , the decapitation death scene ( clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass) ... even right down to the father 's involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable . < br /><br />Although it is common to star a B - Rated cast into a horror title this far into a series , the acting is off the charts , chock - full of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film . The atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles . In addition , the epic score composed by Goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle ; an absolute joke , and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a " bank " of stock audio ... which really says something , because rarely do I comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score - until now.<br /><br />All in all , I 'd call Omen IV : The Awakening a failure . In the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them , some manage to hit the mark and some do n't . If you 're interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as I am for completion purposes , perhaps you could carve this title into it as well - if not for entertainment value , then to appreciate when a film is executed properly , or poorly .
0 Having listened to and enjoyed Harvey Bernhard 's Omen II commentary I was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish . It 's like a really bad TV movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote . I think at the bit where Michael Lerner is confronted by what I can only describe as a high school cast of Les Miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief . And then my mouth was going up and down because I was laughing so much . Dire . I do n't know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines , I have made my point succinctly , there 's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage .
0 This inferior sequel based by the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard(also producer ) concern on a matrimony named Gene(Michael Woods ) and Karen York(Faye Grant ) . They adopt a little girl named Delia from a convent . Gene York about re - elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee . Meanwhile , Delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen . She creates wreak havoc when goes a metaphysical fair , as stores of numerology , therapy , counselling heal , yoga , tarots , among others are destroyed . Karen York hires an eye private(Michael Lerner ) to investigate the weird and bizarre events.<br /><br />This TV sequel displays thrills , chills , creepy events and gory killing . Delia such as Damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film , happening horrible killings . The chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects . Furthermore , mediocre protagonists , Faye Grant and Michael Woods , however nice cast secondary , such as Michael Lerner , Madison Mason , Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S Davis , he was an Army captain turned into acting . As always , excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith . The movie is exclusively for hardcore followers Omen saga . The motion picture is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard . Previous and much better versions are the following : The immensely superior original ' Omen'(Gregory Peck , Lee Remick)by Richard Donner ; ' Damien'(William Holden , Lee Grant ) by Don Taylor ; ' Final conflict'(Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow ) by Grahame Baker . Rating : Below average .
0 What was the deal with the clothes ? They were all dressed like something out of the late 70 's early 80s . The cars were even were outdated . The school was outdated . The nuns attire was outdated , and the hospital looked like something from the 40 's , with its wards and wooden staircases and things . Nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991 . My mother was laughing , saying " Geeeee - od ! WHEN was this movie MADE ? " When we pressed the " INFO BUTTON " on our remote , we were sure 1991 had to be typo ! Did anybody else notice this ? My FAVORITE part , though , was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband , on the telephone , about the inverted cross in the mirror , and he just says " Well , look , I 've got a congress meeting . I 'll talk to you about it later . " That line was just classic . JUST LIKE A MAN ! My mothers favorite part was when they gave the " Spawn of the Devil Child " her very own Rottweiler . My mother said " Just what the Spawn of the Devil needs ... a Rottweiler " She also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches , clutching their chests . Her OTHER favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot , driving 5 miles a hour , driving right into the garbage truck / dump truck / front end loader thingee . He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car ... but he just kept going , with a real dumb vacant look on his face . I mean , how fast can you GO in a school parking lot ? ! ? ! Whatever !
0 On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good . It 's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl . In fact , sometimes , as in the Exorcist , when girls are possessed or are devilry it 's very effective . But in Omen 4 , it stunk.<br /><br />Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child , rather she is a child with issues . Issues that maybe only a therapist , rather then a priest could help . She does not look scary or devilish . Rather , she looks sulky and moody.<br /><br />This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked . But it 's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies , as a made for TV movie special.<br /><br />On so many levels it lets down . It 's cheap looking , the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama . The characters do not bring any sympathy , and you do not route for them . I recently re - watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas , and it has dated appalling.<br /><br />If your thinking of watching this , then I would suggest that you do n't . Watch one of the others , or watch the Exorcist , or watch The Good Son . Just do n't waste your time on this drivel !
0 Since I 'd seen the other three , I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series . As a stand alone film , this movie is mediocre ; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece ; it 's a travesty . The film goes along the same route that many series ' go down when they 're running out of ideas ; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female . It 's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard , the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum . The film does keep a thread with the original , which I wo n't reveal as despite being obvious ; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie . The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner 's original , and see a young couple adopt a child , which they name Delia ( not Damiella or Damiana , fortunately ) . There 's a big dog involved , and a child minder ; and pretty soon , the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal ; as she 's menstruating at eight years old , and never suffered from any illnesses ... <br /><br />The first two sequels to The Omen were n't bad at all , and the series really should have ended at number three . I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line , as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made . It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality , and the only thing it 's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series . The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl . Indeed , Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch ; but she never convinces that she 's the Antichrist , as her stares are redundant and most of the ' evil ' she does is laughable . Faye Grant is given the meatiest role , and does n't impress ; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time . The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune , which of course has been ripped off from the original ; and is overused . On the whole , this film really is n't worth seeing ; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for , and does n't even do justice to weaker second sequel .
0 The only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining . I would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again . Even for a TV movie it is flat . The cast is boring . The screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand . How two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century . There is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise , and it is shot in slo - mo and cut short at the anticipated pay - off . If you are tempted to see this , pop it in , set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy . With any luck you 'll doze off quickly , and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over . Namely , this movie .
0 ' The Omen 4 : The Awakening ' is a made - for - television sequel to the original ' The Omen ' film . Instead of Satan possessing the body of a little boy , he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents , who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong . The film seems to struggle with any horror factor , and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening , and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is Satan , even with all of the events that surround it . I just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening , particularly when compared to the original .
0 Its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book . This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails . It fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one ( except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films).<br /><br />The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an Omen V.
0 If you are hoping for ANYTHING new , you have chosen the wrong movie . Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it 's predeccesors can be good . Maybe the producer and maybe the director but hopefully they were not serious when they made this THING . This whole movie is like making a greatest hits DVD of the 1st 3 films , but changing the actors . BHHAAAAD .
0 Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other . That 's it . For about 5 minutes we see this . It 's shot in black and white with tons of half - naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music . It LOOKS interesting but there 's no plot and really -- the violence inherent in this got disturbing . Also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea . Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible , boring , stupid and ( ocassionally ) disturbing . Really -- what is the point in all this ? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence . I really wish I could go lower than 1 .
0 First , I should mention that I really enjoyed ISHII Katsuhito 's previous film " Samehada Otoko to Momojiri Onna " ( " Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl " ) . Although it owed a debt to Tarentino 's " Pulp Fiction " , Ishii 's cast was up to the task of carrying the story , and the entire film crackled with energy . The scenes between ASANO Tadanobu and GASHUIN Tatsuya were particularly engaging . There was action , intrigue , bizarre characterizations , enough sex to keep things interesting , and an utterly unpredictable story line.<br /><br />So it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that I began to watch " Party 7 " . And my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits , which left my wife and I actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were ; the mix of anime and live - action work was brilliant ! Then , the actual movie started . Actually , it did n't so much " start " as sort of shuffle in the side door and stand there , fumbling through its pockets , looking uncomfortable.<br /><br />The entire film takes place in three rooms . One is a futuristic voyeur 's paradise ( borrowed a bit from " Shark Skin Man ... " ) , another is a travel agent 's office , and the third ( and far the most used ) is a seedy hotel room . In that room , a cast of seven characters meets and ... does approximately nothing . Really . I 'm no stranger to " talking " films . One of my all - time favorites is " My Dinner with Andre " , the talkiest of all talking films . " My Dinner with Andre " is far more exciting , and it just has two middle - aged men discussing their lives over dinner . The key is that Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn tell interesting stories . The cast of " Party 7 " literally just whine at each other for the entire film . " No , you do n't ! " " Yes , I do ! " " No , you really do n't ! " " Yes , I really do ! " " No , you really , really do n't ! " Yes , I really ... " you get the idea , I hope . I wish the directer had.<br /><br />"Party 7 is an unbelievably unengaging film . There is only the flimsiest of plots ( money stolen from the Yakuza , just like in " Shark Skin Man ... " ) , accompanied by almost no action . There is no interesting dialog . The characters are largely uninteresting . It was as if Ishii took the throwaway conversational moments from Tarentino 's films and built an entire film around them . But Tarentino 's conversations always have their own internal logic and wit ( " They call it a ' Royale , with cheese ' " ) . Not so with the dialog here , which is duller than you can imagine . If it were n't for the brief , hilarious cameo from Gashuin ( who is always marvelous ) and a low - key performance from the awesome ASANO Tadanobu , I would 've given " Party 7 " a single star . It really was chore to make it all the way through .
0 Resnais , wow ! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour . The opening voice - over with old , embellished inter - titles was a nice touch . Then the camera aperture opens ( like the old hand crankers ) on a black & white placard . The camera backs off ( or rather , up ) , suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party . This is all in the first 60 seconds.<br /><br />Then the music starts . A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film ( and yes , I speak French , so I ca n't blame it on the subtitles ) . Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song . Then they leave , and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony . But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out . I endured.<br /><br />It did n't get much better . I 'll tell you why . There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters . We do n't even see their faces half the time ( as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera ) . People flit on & off stage like moths around a lamp , and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot . It 's as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie . With bad songs.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did ( 1 hour ) was that I was looking at the camera techniques , lighting and scenery which were all , I admit , excellent . But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours ? Not me . Maybe tomorrow I 'll try watching the end . Aw , who am I kidding . I have more important things to do . I 'm sure you do , too . Skip this .
0 If I had n't read his name on the DVD cover , I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave . In fact , the film is so far from that , that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s , New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film -- it 's so ... so ... unreal . And , it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films . This is n't necessarily a bad thing -- just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film -- especially when there are so many better French musicals out there . The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical . If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit , I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals , not every French musical is gold . This film is not another " Les parapluies de Cherbourg " ( UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or " Huit Femmes " ( EIGHT WOMEN ) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou , I ca n't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity .
0 ... but the actress playing the daughter just does n't come across as credible.<br /><br />It does n't work for me when I see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12-year - old ... Other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film , that children may sometimes seem more adult - like than adults , but with the casting as it is in this film , it just does n't work for me.<br /><br />you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about , because i could n't bear watching it to the end.<br /><br />i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though - I wish another director would try to pick up this story again .
0 this movie is , despite its " independent " status , a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother - daughter relationship . it was nt that bad at first , but somewhere during the course of the movie -- around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy , i think -- it turns into a cheesey mother - daughter bonding movie . i m sorry , but i do nt know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter ... its probably better that way , though .
0 Disappointing , predictable film in which a woman ( Mc Teer ) travels with her daughter from state to state because she ca n't maintain relationships and find happiness . In this genre ' Anywhere but here ' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into a mother / daughter relationship . With Better acting as well .
0 While watching the film , I 'm not sure what direstion it was to take . There 's a reason a writer should n't direct his work and even act in it as well , you ca n't do it all . I felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats . Ms. McTeer is the film . To add to her amazing talents , her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged . Here is a British actress who can do anything . In my view , conflict is what makes drama and a great story . I felt this film did n't have that . Everything was somewhat easy for the characters , there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted . Watch the film for the sweetness , but most of all for Ms. McTeer 's brilliant performance .
0 We 've all seen this story a hundred times . You can see each plot turn coming a mile away . The relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic . Janet Mcteer 's performance is stock southern hot- ticket mother in vintage clothes . Should have been made for the Lifetime Channel .
0 " The Bank " ( 1915 , Chaplin ) " The Bank " was one of Charlie 's 1915 Essanay films . While these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts , this one seems a bit below average . The gag with the janitorial double combo - locked vault and the tough - luck ending that has Charlie waking up from a dream , in which he is stroking the lead lady 's hair , only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow , are both classic Chaplin moments . They are both ironically the beginning and the end . The middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co - worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl . The mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and Charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not . The mop seems to be Charlie 's alter - ego doing things he wishes he could do but would n't with his own two hands . Interesting stuff but there 's better .
0 I refused to watch this when it originally aired , treasuring the memory of the late , lamented 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope , but I can never resist a challenge . I should have known better . Not quite a remake , and more of a parody than a homage , this show did n't quite know how to play it , and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters . The three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors , and only Emilia Fox could act ( Bob Mortimer is painful in a straight role ) . The supporting cast were merely comedian - acquaintances of Vic and Bob 's wanting to be part of the in - joke , and far too aware of the situation to be convincing . And the CGI , though the effects could n't help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier , merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work , and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue . All style and no substance . ( And whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time , this ' update ' is now also very dated , with ' Matrix'-style fashions , obligatory ' girl power ' scenes , and less than subtle tension between the two living leads . )
0 This video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995 . Beautifully done ! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have major on - screen chemistry when they talk about what the Start button does . I 'm waiting for Microsoft to release a Special Edition DVD complete with deleted scenes , Bill Gates commentary , a documentary of how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP , and more!<br /><br />Overall : 10/10 ( Should have won at least a Golden Globe )
0 One can deal with historical inaccuracies , but this film was just too much . Practically nothing was even close to truth , and even for the era , it was seen as silly.<br /><br />In defense of ford , it was revealed on an old talk show , that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real Wyatt Earp , who was obviously old , senile , and replayed the scene his own way . Earp told the director about the stagecoach , and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival , so despite what other historians claim , Wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated.<br /><br />This movie portrays Earp as an honest man , and also his brothers . History does n't exactly say they were or were n't . Most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters , but that is nothing new . The truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL . Men who saw it as a career , and believe me , in the old West , you did n't have time to think about too much else.<br /><br />Characters that do n't exist , characters depicted dying at the corral who really did n't , all make this a weaker film . It is further weakened by Mature , who really did n't make a convincing Doc . He may be the worst cast choice ever for Doc , but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth . After all , ford did get information first hand from Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />It is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the Mexican girl . Hollywood was very pro Nazi in those days , and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to Hitler idealism . This occurs in most movies until the eighties . It is no excuse , and does cheapen the art , however.<br /><br />The actors who play the Earps do well , and Brennan is always a thrill . In fact , Mature may be the only acting downside of this flick . Still , it is the weakest of the old OK Corral movies .
0 To put it simply , I am not fond of westerns . And having never sat through one from beginning to end , I decided to watch " My Darling Clementine " and see it all the way through , no matter how painful it was for me . At first it was excruciating as expected . I found the acting to be laughable , the scenery ( your standard dessert , horses and cowboys ) boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful . However , after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on , after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure . Focusing in on the cinematography , and how John Ford managed to make even the dullest situations ( dull according to me that is ) look quite stunning at times , made it a lot more interesting . < br /><br />In conclusion , I ca n't go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie by the end of it . However it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end , and that in itself impresses me .
0 What a fantastic premise : A movie about the Berlin Airlift . It should have it all . Tragedy . Suspense . Comradeship . Rivals . Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots . love and Tears . What we 've got , is a film with none of the above . Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so , but he fails miserably . He acts so wooden , that at any given moment he should crack . He tries to play the tough guy , instead of being a tough guy ! Why would Bettina Zimmermann 's character fall in love with him ? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake ? Cause he brings her coal bricks ? The SFX are very , very well done . Too much though . The hundreds or so planes over Berlin , look like an attack - fighter - formation - squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was . Interestingly enough , the White House , the Kremlin , and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set . Notice the same drapes , hanging deep down the windows , as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout . Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty ? By the way , GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY , comes across as a small time , insecure , looser General , who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift . He was very much the opposite . So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion , no suspense and no historic accuracy . Sad , it started out so promising 
0 A few weeks ago the German broadcaster " SAT1 " advertised this movie as the " TV - Event of the year " - sorry , but I 've seen better things on TV this year.<br /><br />I did n't thought much of the movie but I soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when I watched the commercial - namely Titanic and Pearl Harbor because the picture looked so familiar : The " heroine " ( if I can really call her that ) in the middle and her two " loved - ones " next to her - Pearl Harbor , anyone ? In fact the love - story is a poor man 's version of the one in Pearl Harbor and that one was already poor!<br /><br />But as I like watching movies and analyzing their patterns I eventually decided to watch that rubbish . The movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against Russia near the end of the Third Reich promising his wife that he will return . Now fast forward to Spring 1948 : Germany lost the war and the allies & Russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies : capitalism versus communism . Well , I guess you already know the story because you have to know it - The movie does n't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts . The movie tries to depict the US government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially Great Britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they 're trying to help.<br /><br />What was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine 's mother tells her daughter that Germany might be parted in two with a response like : " That 's impossible ! " Or when Stalin ( where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he WILL look like him ) says that Russia has to stop " Coca Cola " from spreading in Germany . Yeah right , if Stalin has ever said something like this . Or there is this one US pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it - please ! Burgers were invented WAY before that time.<br /><br />In the movie you once see a map showing the airlines , funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer - in ' 48 . The US general Lucius Clay who 's main idea was to stay in Berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character Phillip Turner , the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects : Not enough African - American soldiers in the movie , there were like two in the whole film ! Also relationships between US soldiers and German civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the US soldier would 've been sent home . I do n't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married , If it was n't for the death of the pilot in his fake CGI plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the CGI fire!<br /><br />If it was n't enough all Americans in this movie spoke accent - free German although they only were in Germany for a couple of months - look I 'm also American living in Germany for my whole life and even I have a little accent . Notably bad was also the child acting - the kids had like two expressions on their faces : " Normal - I - look - monotonous - like - a - robot " and grinning.<br /><br />All in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in Pearl Harbor just with half of the dialogue . The sad part is that the movie was very successful - 8.97 millions watched the first part and 7.83 millions the second part the day after thus SAT1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group . But like I always think : The biggest pile of bull - crap is where the most flies go to .
0 The idea of making a miniseries about the Berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting German ( post)war movies . It is a theme that has not been explored much as yet . However , the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés . It starts already with the DVD cover of the movie , which is a direct copy of the cover of ' Pearl Harbor'.<br /><br />Luise Kielberg ( Bettina Zimmermann ) gets to hear that her husband , who is a doctor , ( Ulrich Noethen ) has died in Russia and after the war she 's struggling to survive . She finds a job at the American base , gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer ( Heino Ferch ) in town , falls in love with ' m , gets pregnant , and all of a sudden her husband turns up again . Come on ! ! ! We 've seen this once too often . Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well ; Bettina Zimmermann however never really seems to convince . For some reason it always seems she 's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes . It just did n't work for me.<br /><br />The action scenes with the planes and the air lift , we 're sometimes exciting , more often not . Nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot.<br /><br />Unless you 're a big fan of WWII movies , I suggest you spend your money on something else : chocolate ice - cream brings a lot more satisfaction!<br /><br />4 out 10 !
0 Heavenly Days commits a serious comedy faux pas : it 's desperate to teach us a civics lesson , and it wo n't stop until we 've passed the final exam . Fibber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington , where they see the senate in action ( or inaction , if you prefer ) , have a spat with their Senator ( Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career ) , get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children , and meet a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace . Henry Wallace ! ! A year later , he was considered a near communist dupe , but in 1944 , he was A - OK . Add in some truly awful musical moments , a whole lot of flagwaving hooey , and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters , and you 've got a film that must have had Philip Wylie ready to pen Generation of Vipers 2 : D.C. Boogaloo . Drastically unfun , Heavenly Days is another reminder that the Devil has all the best tunes .
0 One - note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists ' teeth on edge . Department store clerk Betsy Drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage , pinning her hopes on women 's magazines until she spies super - bait in the form of sleek bachelor Cary Grant . The rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless Drake pursues her quarry . I guess the word " perky " just about sum 's up Drake 's approach to the role . She does have a charming smile , but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures , I began to overdose . Grant 's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair . There is one scene , however , that almost salvages this slender exercise . Drake queries the hapless Grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies . Here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable , and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes , the film might have amounted to more than a girls ' camp day - dream , circa 1948 .
0 Stalker is right ! Girl sees guy , girl wants guy , girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him , girl wo n't leave him alone , girl pretends to be a patient , girl ca n't stop talking about him , girl pretends to love another guy ( or two ) , he does n't pay attention to her because she 's annoying , girl STILL wo n't leave him alone . Played right , Drake 's character could have been charming but she 's completely , wholly , unrelenting in her pursuit of Cary Grant 's character , her girlfriend - in - cahoots is dull , and sadly , Drake 's attempt at playing , " charmingly screwball " comes off as , " disturbingly demented . " Grant is himself , as usual , which is fine for Cary but it 's as close to a phoned - in performance as I 've ever seen from him . The direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim.<br /><br />Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails , like in this stubbed - out butt of an attempt , it just stinks . Worse still , Drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of Valium and a restraining order . She ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic .
0 I 'm among millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans , but I ca n't think of a single reason to recommend this movie . I do n't understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it appears no one else did , if we 're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards.<br /><br />Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was superb at chasing and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby . Here the director or writers try to rehash the idea , but it fails miserably . I've read comments about how " creepy " Drake was , but I thought that was far too mild a description . Franchot Tone walked through this one as if he were hungover . A casting disaster is one thing . This film is a total disaster.<br /><br />This one does n't deserve 10 lines of comments and I do n't know why that 's a requirement . Too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults.<br /><br />Unless you want to torture someone , give this one a wide berth .
0 This woman never stops talking throughout the movie . She memorized every line , and delivered all without a bit of natural emotion . She also has a most uncharming lisp , and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard . This film has WAY too much Betsy Drake , and not enough Cary Grant , who carried what little was left of the film entirely on his own .
0 Remade today , this film would be a very creepy , very disturbing dark comedy . Stalking , obsession , and a web of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 gloss of aren't - they - cute harmlessness . Drake plays the stalker , an unabashed user of people , alternately pathetic and manipulative , Grant plays the stalking victim , alternately angry and oblivious.<br /><br />Vastly disturbing ; I have n't been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since.<br /><br / >
0 I always found Betsy Drake rather creepy , and this movie reinforces that . As another review said , this is a stalker movie that is n't very funny . I watched it because it has CG in it , but he hardly gets any screen time . It 's no " North by Northwest " ...
0 Maximally manipulative Anabel Sims ( Betsy Drake ) sets out to trap her ideal man , aided by her co - worker , Julie . Esteemed pediatrician Madison Brown ( Cary Grant ) goes from bemused to betrothed in the space of 90 minutes on film , but to the viewer it 's all eternity . Can a movie receive less than one star ? This one is a prime candidate .
0 I went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next Clerks , but left feeling let down . The humor was weak and the characters fairly flat . That is n't to say it was all bad , the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material , but the director switched focus to the cliche'd " save the Mom - and - Pop store from the evil corporation guy " . I felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot , he would have come out with a much more memorable movie . Now , to do the film justice , I am from the Rochester area and loved the way he portrayed Webster . In fact , the best Kevin Smith ( of Clerks ) homage here was giving props to his hometown . Webster , NY is to Checkout what Red Bank , NJ is to Clerks . The director wisely threw in a date at Nick Tahou 's . Trust me , as far as things to do in Rochester , a garbage plate is at the top of the list . I was lucky enough to see this film at the Little in Rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them .
0 i should qualify that title , now that i think about it . Checkout is not entirely worthless . i 've had the opportunity to see it twice , and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie 's expense . so i guess it 's worth something for that . and also it 's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing . as another reviewer pointed out , this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word . not a single original thought went into this movie ( which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me ) . the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie . it is definitely not the next Clerks , it is definitely not original , and it is absolutely not " good , clean fun . " the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated ( after seeing it a first time , the second time can be quite funny , in an insulting sort of way ) . as i looked around the theater , it was obvious that nearly everyone , barring perhaps the elderly , were completely bored or pained by this movie . during some of the particularly emotional scenes , like where Nick chews out his mother , the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done . i even heard someone * groan * in the theater , something i had heretofore never witnessed . i do n't care where you have the chance to see this movie , be it at a film festival , or in a indie theater , or wherever . do yourself a favor , skip this movie with a vengeance . unless you 're like me and just ca n't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made .
0 This is a movie about making a movie . Such movies may be entertaining , but they need some substance , to do so . It did not happen here , I am afraid . Mr Coppola did not inherit his father 's skills , unfortunately ( neither did his sister , who can however make movies which one might watch).<br /><br />I do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews . < br /><br />Let 's see : the lead male actor , supposedly a director , is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says , the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes , the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element , the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks ... Would that be enough?<br /><br />I regretted every single moment I watched this movie . A walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie . It 's as if a François Truffaut plot were directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /><br />Brazil , some other classic SF movies ? You must be really joking ...
0 CQ is incredibly slow , and I 'm a David Mamet fan . The movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very Barbarella - esque film . After that the movie started to lose me . Deep and profound ? Not really . The movie " Dragonfly " being made in CQ has the problem of having no ending . This greatly parallels CQ , which also lacks an ending ( in my opinion).<br /><br />I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the SxSW film festival . I had fairly high expectations having just watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies . I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman 's performance . But it was not an easy film to get into . If you 're not into 60 's sci - fi or slow movies that go no where , skip it.<br /><br />CQ feels like a student film . If you want a recent sci - fi - esque indie film rent Donnie Darko , it wo n't put you to sleep .
0 CQ was the worst film I saw this year . Nearly every film I choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say . This film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his Intro . to Filmmaking class . His father makes great films . His sister made a good one . But brother Roman ? NO ! One critic had the audacity to compare this film to Godard 's Le Mépris ( Contempt ) . While Coppola , Jr. did take the same idea , a film about film , he tried too hard to make himself seem European , artsy , and witty , when it 's all really just kitsch . The lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film , like he 's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him . Schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director . Depardieu is alright . The one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is , surprisingly , not the B - movie scenes , but rather one which takes place in Italy ; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car , driving around picking up and dropping off random people . This was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I am guessing he was trying to spoof . Or rip - off . Or both . The documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out , the ending was tagged on for the sake of a " twist " or artistic value ... I suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself , and not in the way it intended . No wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re - edited or re - shot or whatever , which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before . I ca n't believe it could have been worse than this . If you want to see a good parody of film check out the Austin Powers films . Any of them . The opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film . Lil ' Romy , for the sake of cinema , PLEASE go back to directing your cousin 's music videos . Leave The Godfathers to daddy .
0 Okay , the film festival crowd probably loved it . But your average , popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to - gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice . If it 's stamped " Copolla " it 's automatically great stuff , right ? Wrong ! It 's a neat spoof of filmdom 's pretensions . But it 's terribly " in . " I worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public . It 's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it . But once it 's run its course in the movies and on TV , the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it . Hardly either epochal or an epic !
0 CQ could have been good , campy fun . But it commits the only unforgivable sin : it is b - o - r - i - n - g ! The pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it 's next to impossible to care where it 's going . The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label : " CAUTION : Student film . Fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker . "
0 Style but no substance . Not as funny as it should be . Not as deep as it wants to be.<br /><br />This is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking . A young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s sci - fi movie called Codename : Dragonfly . Think Barbarella , or Danger Diabolique.<br /><br />But Jeremy Davies is an angst - ridden filmmaker . He 's no hack he 's an artist . The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life . Hardly original.<br /><br />All the characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as rice - paper . Characters that might be interesting , such as his father , his doppelganger , or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing.<br /><br />This movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison . Those movies are funny , provocative with well - developed characters . Those movies have lessons that apply outside < br /><br />The movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene . The filmmakers describe it as a send - up but what 's the satirical target ? The actors say it 's an homage but I think I would rather a full - length version of Codename : Dragonfly.<br /><br />Coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci - fi movie within a movie . But he fails to share why we should be amused.<br /><br />Outside of the sci - fi movie its just a mess . There are continuity errors , the filmmaker chooses a sci - fi weapon after its already been chosen . What?<br /><br />Just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story , lack of a point , a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms.<br /><br />I guess if your Roman Coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst - ridden idealistic filmmaker who does n't know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing . In that sense it may be considered autobiograhical.<br /><br />I would watch it at Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice . Watch the 15-minute Codename : Dragonfly movies included on the DVD as extras and then send it back .
0 From the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper . " CQ " tells a lame , disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures , a babe , and straight man Davies running around trying to make a stupid sci - fi flick . I ca n't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making . ( D )
0 I really love the sexy action and sci - fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress 's that appeared in them . They found the sexiest women to be in these films and it did n't matter if they could act ( Remember " Candy " ? ) . The reason I was disappointed by this film was because it was n't nostalgic enough . The story here has a European sci - fi film called " Dragonfly " being made and the director is fired . So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker ( Jeremy Davies ) to complete the picture . They 're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays Dragonfly but she 's barely in it . Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script . I wish the film could have been an homage to those early films . They could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them . There is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its John Phillip Law ( Barbarella ) . Gerard Depardieu , Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell appear as well . I guess I 'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties . If any are reading this , " Make it as sexy as you can " ! I 'll be waiting !
0 All you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes : it looks cool , it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period , and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable . Once you get that message , you may as well switch to another film.<br /><br />Davies 's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend , one of the few people in his life who cares about him . Then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world -- instead of living a fantasy film of which he 's the imagined director -- he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he 's idealized beyond reason . A couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.<br /><br />The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzman 's fall from Mount Rushmore . In Rushmore , Schwartzman 's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome , but here it 's his character 's only quality . Schwartzman 's family connection clearly landed him in this role ; here 's hoping his choices improve .
0 When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California , I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up . Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith . This is being spied on by Jimmy ( a young Tom Byron ) . Jimmy 's aunt ( Honey Wilder ) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher ( Kay Parker ) . I could do without the animal , robot role - playing , or the incest aspects . There 's one good sex scene , between Byron and Parker , but it 's not good enough to save this film.<br /><br />My Grade : D+
0 I did n't even know this was originally a made - for - tv movie when I saw it , but I guessed it through the running time . It has the same washed - out colors , bland characters , and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80 's , plus a ' social platform ' that practically screams " Afterschool special " . Anyhoo.<br /><br />Rona Jaffe 's ( thank you ) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons , a pen - and - paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America . I count myself one of said geeks , tho I have never played D&D specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren . M&M was also made in the heyday of D&D 's major controversy - that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality , be worshiping Satan without knowing , blah blah . I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point , if extremely rare - but it dates this movie horrendously.<br /><br />We meet 4 young college students , who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters , to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life . Except that M&M as presented is more boring than their mundane lives . None of the allure of gaming is presented here - and Jay Jay 's request to take M&M into ' the real world ' comes out of nowhere . It 's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also - though at that point we do n't really care . Jay Jay , Robbie , Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different - but they 're all rich WASPy prigs who have problems no one really has.<br /><br />But things just continue , getting worse in more ways than one . The low budget comes dreadfully clear , ( I love the ' Entrance ' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns ) Robbie / Pardu shows why he 's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever , and the payoff atop the ' Two Towers ' is unintentionally hilarious . Tom Hanks ' blubbering " Jay Jay , what am I doing here ? " made me laugh for minutes on end . Definitely the low point in his career.<br /><br />Don't look at it as a cogent satire , just a laughable piece of 80 's TV trash , and you 'll still have a good time . That is , if you can stay awake . The majority is mostly boring , but it 's all worthwhile for Pardu 's breakdown at the end . At least Tom Hanks has gotten better . Not that he could go much worse from here .
0 The psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out . Its often billed as an anti - RPG movie , but its really not that simple . Here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what ( if anything ) they 're trying to say about gaming.<br /><br />They laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction , all of them having parents who are divorced , alcoholic , and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they 're harshly pressuring them to succeed . Tom Hanks is arguably the worst off , having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead . < br /><br />Its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives . And sure enough , at the end , when they go to see Robbie ( Hanks ) , they 're all happy and well - adjusted , embarking on their adult careers , problems solved , games put away ( Daniel does n't even want to design computer games any more ) , and even Robbie 's mother , who 's been constantly drunk and dissatisfied , is suddenly the Happy Homemaker , looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers . < br /><br />Sure , JJ suddenly ( and quite cheerfully it seems ) decides to commit suicide , but the reason seems to be entirely because he 's a lonely boy genius who ca n't get a date , and not because his character dies , as in the famous Jack Chick tract ( which happens afterward anyways , and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end Daniels game and get everyone to come play his . In fact , the prospect of live - action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself ! ) And in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie , Kate , looking very fetching in chain mail , looks right at the camera and says something like , " The scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds . " < br /><br />The biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty , homeless - looking guy of his magic beans . The recurring theme ( a " The Way We Were " for the 80s)might have been poignant at the end , but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place . And for one final mystery , our hero , wearing full Pardu regalia , has a psychotic break , becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest , so of course the first thing he does is change into 20-century street clothes . < br /><br />So maybe the movie 's irrational , but I guess its dealing with an irrational topic . In those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed , and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo - jumbo at you . The anti - game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene , where the reporter asks the cop what s going on , the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there 's a chance Mazes and Monsters is somehow involved . The reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game ( although he allows his own children to play it ) , then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation . In the end , its no masterpiece , but interesting as made - for - TV movies go .
0 Yes , about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood . Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through . Yes , this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios . Basically , an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters . Apparently , the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking , drugs , having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing . No , these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain , heaven 's no ! Not that , if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there . Yes , I think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time . Granted , it could be a movie against addiction , but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month .
0 Hoo boy , this was a real trial to get through . The DVD case has Tom Hanks ' mug plastered on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it . He looks about forty on the box , however , the movie was made in 1982 , so he still has his Bosom Buddies ' do and of course is about forty pounds lighter . The plot concerns a Dungeons and Dragons like game that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real . Chris Makepeace is a boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats . Ooh , look , he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo ! Now he 's dressed like a WWI pilot ! This was a truly awful movie but in a bad way . A bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids . There 's Anne ( I 'm Honey West , dammit ! ) Francis and Louise Sorel , who actually looks kind of hot . Murray Hamilton , the Mayor from Jaws , has a thankless roll as a cop . Wendy Crewson , is the love interest for Hanks and some blonde guy I have never seen before or since . There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement . There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he 's , you know , nuts . The monster is played by the late , great Kevin Peter Hall , he of Predator fame . A friend of mine got this out of the ol' discount bin at MallWart and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it , so naturally I had to see if it was as bad as all that . It was . The night before , I watched Apollo 13 , so after that , this movie was a bit of a shock . Do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin . Oh yeah , after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions , he goes home to recuperate and is visited by his friends . Hanks mother , a drunken Vera Miles , says he is coming along nicely now but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit , he is crazier than ever . The End
0 Do n't get me wrong , I assumed this movie would be stupid , I honestly did , I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet . The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going ( different story for a different time ) . As I began watching I noticed something , this film was terrible . Now there are two types of terrible , there 's Freddy vs. Jason terrible , where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is , and then there is a movie like this . The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me . As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless , but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie . Mike Myers is usually brilliant , I love the majority of his work , but something in this movie did n't click . One of the things that the director / producers / writers / whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book ( red , black , white ) on any character but the Cat . Coincidentally or not , they also refused to capture any of the original ( and i hate to use this word , but it fits ) zaniness of the original . The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday , colorful and delicious , and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust.<br /><br />Avoid this like a leprous prostitute .
0 Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on . But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt . However , my decision to see " The Cat in the Hat " was n't made haphazardly . You see , three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the " calamity " known as " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " . Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful , funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat . So when the critics unleashed their fury against " The Cat in the Hat " , another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role , I thought that it must be the same old song . How wrong I was.<br /><br />For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear . The opening credits are clever , the kids are charming and the production values are top notch . Then the cat showed up . There are many problems from this point on , but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers . Where " The Grinch " was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey , " The Cat " was destroyed by Myers . He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong , comic sketches . Every movie he 's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch , from " Wayne 's World " to " Austin Powers " . So he tries to do the same thing here , it 's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL , not funny , just painful . Not that the writers helped him out any . After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags , poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor . This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had . Period . So much talent and work went into something so vile . I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess , I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies . If you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague . With movies like " Elf " and " Brother Bear " currently in theaters , you have far better choices .
0 Audrey , I know you truly cherish your husband Ted 's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes . Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason . We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories , images , fantasies and characters . They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway . The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.<br /><br />It is indeed your property to do with as you wish . I just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while . Save what is left of Dr. Seuss . Thank you .
0 The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I did n't have to pay for it . I saw it for free at college . And if a college student ca n't find humor in something that was free , it 's hopeless.<br /><br />Stale acting and poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent , yet bewildering set design ( that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles ) . I do n't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie , but I have never seen anything more depressing . This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch ( which has its opponents , but I enjoyed it very much ) . It 's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.<br /><br />You want a funny Seuss adaptation ? Go with the Grinch .
0 If you liked the Grinch movie ... go watch that again , because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation . Mike Myers ' Cat is probably the most annoying character to " grace " the screen in recent times . His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound , which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater . Not even the kids liked this one folks , and kids laugh at anything now . Save your money and go see Looney Tunes : Back in Action if you 're really looking for a fun holiday family movie .
0 This movie was physically painful to sit through , maybe because ( like many people my age , and younger ) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny , clever , whimsical and subversive at the same time . " The Cat in the Hat " sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story , and Mike Myer 's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering . Why the Borscht Belt accent , the unfunny patter , the inappropriate jokes , the charmless costume ? I had to go back and re - read the books to see the real problem : the books are SIMPLE . This movie is OVERBLOWN and way , way too long.<br /><br />You do n't expect every kids ' movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant , but this one set a new low . How could Mike Myers need the money ?
0 From the acting , direction , scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims . When did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children 's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.<br /><br />Dr Suess is rolling in his grave right now , what with the " dirty ho " " S.H.I.T " and fake erection scenes etc etc etc . Its shameful how they trade on the name of Suess to get the parents to bring their kids , throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who wo n't watch a a film with their child if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed.<br /><br />Compare this to the classic children 's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into . These guys should stick to making MTV videos . How on earth this movie got > 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me . ( unless its the directors family )
0 Well the previews looked funny and I usually do n't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ...... well you never know . Here is a movie that does n't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults . I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells . Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss 's classic . It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children 's mother for her money . If that was a subplot , then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and " the cat " plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is . Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie .
0 Mean spirited , and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children 's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever . Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together . He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film . The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor . I have seen a lot of bad film this year , but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made .
0 Inappropriate . The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA . Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG ? Please . Parents do n't be fooled , taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake . There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids , but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.<br /><br />But all that aside , The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie . The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces . The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable ( or hateable in this case ) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this . The kids are conditioned actors and it shows , especially with Dakota Fanning . Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.<br /><br />Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie ? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable . I did n't like him as the voice of Shrek , and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children 's films ever again . His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.<br /><br />In the end , the cat should not have come , he should have stayed away , but he came , even if just for a day , he ruined 82 minutes of my life , 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.<br /><br />The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever .
0 The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film . Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse . This is his worst film he has ever been in . The acting and the story was just terrible . I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr. Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all - time and such a disappointment . I could n't have seen a more worst film than this besides , maybe Baby Geniuses . But this film is just so bad I ca n't even describe how badly they made this film . Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should . < br /><br />Hedeen 's outlook : 0/10 No Stars F
0 This movie has made me upset ! When I think of Cat in the hat . I m thinking of cat in the hat books . You know , the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children . Well , I though that this movie would be a lot like that ! But much to my suprise was nothing like the books ! Insted it is more like young adult humor movie . In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool ( hoe ) cat talks to it like it is his hoe ( agin adult humor ) . the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie . under the rating you 'll find : mild cude humor and some double - entendres . I think in short this means adult humor . I wish I could return this movie ! wal - mart said they would n't because the movie has been opened . If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy .
0 Bad . Bad . Bad . Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema . and its ... # 1 Movie in America ! What is this country thinking ? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson . Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes . A lame plot with dirty jokes . It 's grotesuque and awful . When Green - Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I 'll be so happy ! ( not ) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green - Eggs and Ham . They 'll try to chase Sam - I - Am and that mean guy who are running away with it . ( I hope they do n't ruin the classic book . ) Do n't waste time and money by seeing this .
0 There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short.<br /><br />"The Grinch " I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented , physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor ( in my opinion ) . Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying . I used to like him very much in his " Waynes World " and " So I Married an Axe Murderer " days - but I ve never been fond of Austin Powers and " the Cat In The Hat " has just finished me off . < br /><br />This film was horrible - the gags were horrible ! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they have nt amused anyone for 50 years ! The plot was messy , messy , messy ! Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was " Mom " . They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it were n't for Myers ugly , revolting over - acted portrayal of the Cat.<br /><br />I mean - did Myers even glance at a script ? Was one written ? The other actors seemed to have one - but the Cat just seemed to be winging it!<br /><br />On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous ! ! ! But unfortunately they ca nt save this film.<br /><br />Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius ! Do nt ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy , messy way!!!<br /><br />1/10
0 Just about everything in this movie is wrong , wrong , wrong . Take Mike Myers , for example . He 's reached the point where you realize that his shtick has n't changed since his SNL days , over ten years ago . He 's doing the same cutesy stream - of - consciousness jokes and the same voices . His Cat is painfully unfunny . He tries way to hard . He 's some weird Type A comedian , not the cool cat he 's supposed to be . The rest of the movie is just as bad . The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars . ( Cardboard cut - outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street . ) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression , but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent . There 's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story . Avoid this movie at all costs , folks . It 's not even an interesting train wreck . ( I hope they 'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams . Then we 'll have the bad - Seuss movie - starring - spasitc- comedian trilogy . )
0 The sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so I went to the movies , that cold , cold , wet date day.<br /><br />"The Cat in the Hat " was the name of the flick , and when it was over , my stomach was sick.<br /><br />Mike Myers played the Cat , his humor was lame , and kids need n't see this , the humor was not tame.<br /><br />the film was like drinking milk , from a rabid cow , so it IS fun to have fun , yet the filmmakers did n't know how.<br /><br />This film , in short is atrocious . The acting was bad , the plot was tweaked too much , and the humor was surprisingly very crude.<br /><br />It starts with Conrad and Sally , A rule breaker and a future sheriff . When their Mother has to go to work , she gets Mrs. Kwan to babysit . Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room , a ` la C - SPAN . She soon falls asleep , and here comes the Cat.<br /><br />The film starts to spiral out of control . The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun . He 's got Thing 1 and Thing 2 , Who suddenly start trashing the house . He improvises a TV Infomercial , and accidentally slices his tail off . And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda , it 's not funny . Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist . And there 's a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat.<br /><br />Too bad he did n't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk , or chopping your tail off.<br /><br />Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog , who has the key to a crate on his collar . If the crate is not locked soon , their house will be home to the Cat 's universe . Here it gets a little more interesting , but not enough to save the film.<br /><br />The acting , overall , is horrible . Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat , Saying things like " You dirty ho " and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata . Spencer Breslin is great as the trouble - making Conrad , and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally , though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritter(accident waiting to happen ) . Alec Baldwin 's slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting , ever trying to woo the kids mom , who is played by Kelly Preston . And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob , Mom 's boss , and is also the voice of the fish . The latter three are also bland.<br /><br />Overall , if I were a parent I would not take my kids who are into potty humor , cause there 's plenty of it and more . Save your $ 7.00 and see something else . As the late great Dr. Seuss once said,<br /><br />It is fun to have fun , But you have to know how . Really , Universal , stop ! Theodore 's already turning over in his grave.<br /><br />Like my Mom always says , " Curiousity killed the Cat".- The Cat In The Hat * out of * * * * *
0 Well I guess I know the answer to that question . For the MONEY ! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie . I admit , I thought the trailers looked bad , but I still had to give it a chance . Well I should have went with my instincts . It was a complete piece Hollywood trash . Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good , must be good . Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long , it obviously started with a moth eaten script . It 's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor , and awful pastel sceneries . It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction . This is then compounded with , ............................ yes I 'll say it , BAD ACTING ! I could n't help but feel like I was watching " Coffee Talk " on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth . Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman ? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either , but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he 's ready to make another Austin Powers movie . F- , no stars , 0 on a scale of 1 - 10 . Save your money !
0 When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film , I know it is bad . I wanted to claw my eyes out . I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had . This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to " unwatch " , if only it were possible . The other films being ' Troll 2 ' and ' Fast and Furious ' , both which are better than this crap in the hat.<br /><br />I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name.<br /><br />To Mike Myers , I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World . Just because it worked for Jim Carrey , does n't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.<br /><br / >
0 Holy cow , what a piece of sh*t this movie is . I did n't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie . I guess they did n't know either ! I do n't remember any farting or belching in the book , do you?<br /><br />They took this all times childrens classic , added some farting , belching and sexual inuindo , and prostituted it into a KAKA joke . This should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like . I have to say , visually it was interesting , but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor ( if you even think that kind of thing is funny ) I DON'T want the kids that I know to think it is.<br /><br />Don't take your kids to see , do n't rent the DVD . I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie .
0 I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production . But it turned out to be the the biggest let down . A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss . It was vulgar and distasteful I do n't think Dr Seuss would have approved . How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better . I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on . Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked . Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who . I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice .
0 I 've seen some bad things in my time . A half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud ; a head on collision between two cars ; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor ; human beings living like animals.<br /><br />But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hat.<br /><br />This film is worse than 911 , worse than Hitler , worse than Vllad the Impaler , worse than people who put kittens in microwaves.<br /><br />It is the most disturbing film of all time , easy.<br /><br />I used to think it was a joke , some elaborate joke and that Mike Myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something.<br /><br />I shudder
0 Spend your time any other way , even housework is better than this movie . The jokes are n't funny , the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus are n't there . A very lousy way to waste an evening . My kids 4 - 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net . My wife left and did dishes . So I finished it alone . It was the worst " kids " movie I have seen . If you want to watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek 2 , that movie is fun for kids and their parents . AVOID THIS MOVIE . It is n't funny , is n't cute , the cat 's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label .
0 Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive . Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop . We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat , big mistake ! Myers proves he ca n't act in this film . He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve . The kids in this movie are all right , somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying . The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories , never tweak with the original story ! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea . He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life . This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it . The film sure does look tacky ! Sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word , mildly funny . At least the Grinch had spunk , and the film was actually good ! This film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting . Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually ? And another thing , the fish . What is with that stupid fish ! First time you see him , he 's an actual fish . Next time you see him , he 's all animated and talking . But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough ! This film is a total off target wreck . Good joke , bad joke , bad , bad , bad , good joke ! I 'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke , that was good . So please if you have the choice , watch the Grinch instead of this mess .
0 No redeeming features , this film is rubbish . Its jokes do n't begin to be funny . The humour for children is pathetic , and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package . Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next . I could n't enjoy the film at all . Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD , neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again , unlike with Monsters inc , Finding Nemo , Jungle Book , Lion King , etc . which all get frequent requests for replays .
0 Most movies I can sit through easily , even if I do not particularly like the movie . I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre . This is the first movie I could not stand to watch . Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen -- and I 've seen a lot of movies . The acting is okay ( Myers is good as the cat , it 's just that he is REALLY annoying ) . The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous , even for the children in the audience . The plot drags on and on , and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue . The " witty " parental remarks are disgusting , not funny ( I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to , well , a type of person people call a " ho " ) . Even though the movie is really short , it seemed to last FOREVER . Do not waste your time . I know small kids who hated this movie . If children ca n't stand it , I do not know how any adults can . I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it . I HATED IT ! So , in summary , do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this ! See a GOOD movie!<br /><br />1/10 stars -- the lowest review I have ever given a movie .
0 An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children 's book . Crude and inappropriate humor , some scary parts , and a sickening side story about the mom 's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book ( 3 - 8 ) yr olds . Do n't waste your money , your time , or your good judgement .
0 Shame Shame Shame on UA / DW for what you do ! < br /><br />I was appalled . < br /><br />Do NOT take kids to see this movie . The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they 'll be bored and disappointed . Certainly * we all * have read Theo 's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations ... but this is pure trash . Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would 've never given his " thumbs up " at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.<br /><br />What a pity . < br /><br />Spend your money on the book . If you own a copy , then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program . This movie is NOT worth a " free " ticket viewing.<br /><br />Stick with the book . The tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money ... seriously . SAVE your money - it will be on cable by saint patty 's day.<br /><br />Shame shame shame on what they do ! !
0 There 's only one thing I 'm going to say about cat in the hat ... as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks ... I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but were n't exactly kid appropriate . Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying ... as for the plot I completely forgot . Who cares it sucked anyway . i 'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying . do n't see it - it belongs in the bottom 100 .............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it 's funny
0 If one sits down to watch Unhinged , it is probably because its advertisements , video boxes , whatever , scream that it was banned in the UK for over 20 years ( as virtually every video nasty does ) . It 's true ; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy . Being an exploitation fan , however , none of this was new to me . The advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the UK do n't necessarily make me want to watch it ; in fact , the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid British censors are . How I came to viewing this then is simple : it promised gore and it was only $ 6.99 . The price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next Halloween , but a cheap padding of your DVD collection never hurts . I did force myself , however , to watch it all in one sitting , because I find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it . So anyway , after 90 minutes of Unhinged , I found that I had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence . I think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique.<br /><br />The layout of Unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s . There 's unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore . That 's about it . Anyway , it starts with a group of three attractive co - eds crashing their car on the way to a concert . Though two of them ( Terry and Nancy ) are okay , one ( Gloria ) is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie . They are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion ( that happens to have no phone , of course ) with rather strange occupants : Marion is a middle - aged woman with a man - hating mother who constantly accuses Marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them ( echoes of Psycho ? ) . She also happens to have a crazy brother Carl who lives in the woods , because her mother 's hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house . After hanging with Marion for awhile , Terry ( our " hero " ) and Nancy decide they must contact their parents . Despite everyone 's warnings , Nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone ( her fate is not hard to predict ) . After that , we see Gloria again , who is then promptly butchered with an ax . When Terry discovers that Gloria has disappeared from her room , she decides something is n't right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends . That may be easier said than done , however , with crazy Carl lurking around   < br /><br />After viewing Unhinged , I read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that Unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end . Normally , I do not drag other people 's opinions into my reviews ( especially when they contradict my views ) , but in this case , I was so puzzled by their reactions that I thought it would be relevant to mention . This is because in actuality , the film crawls . Normally for the slow - building tactic to work , the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger . Oh sure , we see two of them get murdered , but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom . We are aware that there 's a killer on the loose , but this is only focused on three times in the film ; that means there 's no reason to fear for the victims . Instead , the film 's events are explained not by the actions of the characters , but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking . If there 's one thing I can assure you from watching this , it 's that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious . None of this is helped by the atrocious acting . It seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience.<br /><br />Of course , I 'd be a liar if I said there was n't one part of the movie that I enjoyed . Specifically , the ending was one of the best I 've ever seen in a slasher film ; you just do not expect that to happen . Just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular . Ah , I wo n't spoil it for you , nor will I say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow - moving film , but it definitely will get your attention . Other than that , the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material , but it 's not like you could n't tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film . Anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed , however ; those are the only scenes of gore present . That and , of course , no one scene can save an entire movie . I normally preach the doctrine that as long as there 's action , the worse a movie is , the better it gets . Unhinged only grasps one part of this concept . The whole film just feels Luke - warm ; there 's potential alright , but the director either was n't experienced enough to make it work or just did n't know what the hell he was doing .
0 I tried to like this slasher , like I try to enjoy all slasher films . I mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense , how can you go wrong . But Unhinged I think is an example of that formula going wrong . The main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house . It was as if they were under sedation , and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight . The film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction saps it of those , and leaves the movie pretty dull . It 's a shame , because if the movie was better executed , it would have have been ace . The story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother , the girls , and the daughter in the old house . There 's some good nudity , and occasional splashy bloodletting , just not enough to give the film the kick it needed . The finale is pretty twisted and fearsome , and does give the film a big lift but sadly , its too little too late . So , in my opinion , one to avoid , unless you really love obscure slasher films . There 's a fair amount of potential , but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile .
0 this movie was banned in england ? why ? tom savini , george romero , dario argento , lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since ... <br /><br />this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80 's horror film . good looking girls ( who ca n't act to save their lives , by the way ) , a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour , a scythe , a crazy brother wandering around the family estate , and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end . but banned ? seriously . when the English parliament banned this movie , the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were.<br /><br />there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore ( which was greatly underdone ) . there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made , obviously . but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned.<br /><br />i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with . as it stands , the film is entertaining , but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result.<br /><br />banned ... what a joke ...
0 Unhinged was part of the Video Nasty censorship film selection that the UK built up in the 80 's . Keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children , do n't you know ! It must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about . By today 's standard , Unhinged is a tame little fairy tale.<br /><br />3 girls are off to a jazz concert ... and right away , you know the body count is going to be quite low . They get lost in the woods , & wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it 's laughable . They are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house . One of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs . Then there 's talking . Talking about why the girls are here , and how they must be to dinner on time because mother does n't like it when someone is late . And more talking . Yakkity yak . Some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls , and someone 's eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like Hitchcock 's Psycho . I digress because there is so much blah blah in this film , that you wonder when the killings are going to start . In fact , one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods , alone , looking for the town . Smart move . She probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part , but just did n't care . More talk continues after this as we wait , wait , and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed.<br /><br />And then there 's the twist ending . The " expected " unexpected for some viewers , for others a real gotcha . Quite possibly the ONLY reason why someone would really want to watch this . I do n't care how twisted it is , nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time I had watching it . Even with the minor impact of the ending , the director just did n't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it . It would have made a much better 30 minute - 1 hour TV episode on say , Tales from the Darkside.<br /><br />If you really must get this for any reason , perhaps just to say you 've watched every slasher movie , do yourself a favor and have the fast - forward button ready . Since the movie has so many unimportant scenes , just zoom through them , and in no time , you 'll get to the " WOW , that 's what it was all this time " ending . Oh and halfway through the movie there 's a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo - bees . Horray for boo - bees . Those beautiful buzzing honey - making boo - bees .
0 Twist endings can be really cool in a movie . It 's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes , but we just do n't pay attention . Those type of twist endings are the one 's that make people think . Then we 've got twists like this film has . Twists that , whether or not you pay attention , you have no clue what 's going to happen . When they reveal this kind of random twist , instead of shock , it 's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction . This film starts off like it 's going to be an interesting take on horror , but after about 20 minutes , it 's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist.<br /><br />Three young women are going to a concert , so they get lost traveling through the woods , and hit a tree trunk . They end up at some old creepy lady 's house , who hates men , and they are greeted by her homely daughter Marion ( Laurel Munson ) . Strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home , and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.<br /><br />This film is too caught up in it 's dialogue , and it 's always between only a few characters . We have the main three girls , the creepy spinster and the old lady , and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five . To make matters worse , they never have anything interesting to say . It 's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations . We want to know what 's going on , and instead they just talk and talk and talk ( about nothing).<br /><br />Plot holes are abundant here . The house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere ... wow , three miles ! A two hour or less walk will kill them . Why did n't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town ? Did he have a one seater ? How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay , rarely even checking up on each other ? Why did this have to have so many dumb twists ? Maybe the answers are in the boring script.<br /><br />Having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea . It 's not thrilling , it 's not scary , and the ending is definitely out there , but undoubtedly dumb.<br /><br />My rating : * 1/2 out of * * * * . 79 mins . R for nudity and violence .
0 Ever watched a movie that lost the plot ? Well , this did n't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin ? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms ( that are strangely never actually heard in the house - great double glazing ) ? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away ( ? ) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable ? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 + killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house ? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who ca n't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty , but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80 's ( mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder ) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic ' daft ' murder ( do n't worry - its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up . Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe . What do they do ? Slide down and run like the rest of us ? No , of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.<br /><br />It really IS only a movie as they say ..
0 I 've never really considered myself much of " student " when it comes to watching films , I watch them , form an opinion and that 's it . But Unhinged changed all this . This film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making I 've ever seen . Every kid who rocks up at university thinking they 're gon na be the next Spielberg or Tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled " How Not to Make A Film " . Not only is there no story to be had , the film makers were n't even competent enough to make a film worth watching . It 's been a while since I saw it , but all I can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes . They are never ending ! It 's almost like having your teeth pulled , only not as much fun .
0 Unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80 's slasher trend . Pretty Young Girls In Peril . I have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road - trip shots , you actually think for a second there 's going to be quality in the production . Watching " Unhinged " was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it 's warm - up . Some of the most awkward , badly lit , overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a Valium overdose . I wondered why they did n't just put the cue - cards on camera so the actresses would n't have to constantly shift their gaze . The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T&A factor rather than talent . Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as watching paint dry . Two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill . Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy / creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for Worst Acting Ever . Long pauses , weird expressions , emphasis on the wrong word , it 's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films . The scenes shift suddenly with long black - outs you could drive a Mack truck through . Cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky . Eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer . But ya know , it grew on me . I felt sorry for it . I wanted to hug it , kiss it 's boo - boos and make it better . The ending does n't make up for the damage it 's caused but I grinned anyway . I have my own theories regarding the whole " banned " hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor . Otherwise pass .
0 I had never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD rental outlet mentioned it to me ; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the U.K. , I decided to check it out . The film turned out be a dull , amateurish and ugly - looking ride ; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time , whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept ! < br /><br />What ’s worse , the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings . Soon , one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again ; another , still bed - ridden , is quickly disposed of ( after being forgotten for most of the duration ) . The heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house : a harridan of a bible - thumping mother ( cue horrendous overacting ) , her repressed ( and long - suffering ) daughter , and the latter ’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.<br /><br />Often resorting to dinner - table reminiscences by the man - hating mother ( as a means of filling in the dreary , to say nothing of unoriginal , backstory ) and which invariably develop into mother - daughter sparring contests , the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious , but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film ( as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore ) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ...
0 Banned as a ' Video Nasty ' in the UK , Unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety . However , the most shocking thing I found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments . The bloodletting I could handle : the terrible acting , shoddy editing , awful direction , lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take.<br /><br />Three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm . They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house . The owner of the house , a batty old lady , and her spinster daughter , welcome the girls in , allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recuperate . However , someone does n't want the girls to leaveever ! One by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant.<br /><br />Taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film ( and that takes some doing ) , Unhinged is a truly awful film . The music is a total mess ( it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser ) and as such , it complements the movie perfectly . Only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score.<br /><br />If you are a horror completist ( and unfortunately , I am ) , you will want to see this in order to tick it off the Video Nasty watch - list . But be warnedit is really , really bad .
0 I bought Unhinged because I got suckered by the gory picture on the cover . If you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box . All the kills are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie.<br /><br />Having said that , let 's look at the plot . A group of college girls driving to a rock concert ( by way of the deep , dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid ) slide off the road . No visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film ( or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began).<br /><br />The two remaining girls wake up in a big , isolated house . The house , by the way , is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film . For some reason , though , this house has no roads going to it . The only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods . The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch ( who looks like George Washington in drag ) and her equally homely , sexually repressed daughter . The girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of Gilligan 's Island for that three hour tour.<br /><br />By the time we , the viewers , get to the kill scenes , we no longer care . We wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . Unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film . It 's almost as though the ending , the one good idea in the film , was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it.<br /><br />Unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting , inept directing , and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film ( sorry . I 'm not sure where that came from ) . You will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when , for some reason that is never explained , the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering . Do n't waste your time . You 'll just feel Unhinged and want your time and money back .
0 " Unhinged " is one strange little film , a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre . It 's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique . It 's plot is fairly overdone -- three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter . Very quickly , the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic . On top of that , the mother and daughter seem to have a very , very strange relationship , as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner . The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them . Halfway through the film , when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help , the killing begins . < br /><br />As far as the acting goes , this film is at the bottom of the barrel . NONE of the three stranded girls can act , particularly the " lead " girl . It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same , wooden tone throughout the film . The mother and daughter are better , but not much . The film is also quite dull in parts and really , really drags . The killings are gruesome , but nothing we have n't seen before . However , as mentioned on here , the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending . It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic " Sleepaway Camp . " Unfortunately , the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring , boring pacing . The isolated , creepy looking mansion and the dark , foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism , but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act . It may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end , but I say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes . 4 out 10
0 Basic slasher movie premise , 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family . YAWN.<br /><br />Watching 36 minutes of a premonition of OJ 's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco . YAWN.<br /><br />Old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN < br /><br />23 minutes of watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the heck they are eating ... OK there might be a drinking game here ... nope - YAWN < br /><br />Complimentary shower scenes ... OK got my interest for a couple of seconds.<br /><br />Completely random and uninspired killings ... YAWN < br /><br />The ending ... dude ! that psycho is deranged - why could n't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that is it - My advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player - for me I am going back to sleep .
0 I , too , was fooled by the packaging . I , too , fell for the gory packaging and the DVD casing that claims " grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves " . Though it was inexpensive ( $ 6.99 ) , it was n't really all that worth it - no scares , and very limited gore . The ending was very cheesy and did n't deliver the punch it should have . I really do n't even know how it became a " Video Nasty " with how very tame it is . The story drags , the characters are obvious amateur actors ... it does n't live up to the promise . The DVD bonus feature ( the " interview")is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there . The lead actress talks like she 's appearing in a Shakespearean production . It 's a great laugh .
0 I bought this movie for $ 5 at a used CD store , and I kinda regret it . I 'll start by saying I 'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks . They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment . This movie entertained for the first half hour , because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an MST3 K style manner quite easily . Then it got boring.<br /><br />The acting is the scariest part of the movie . While great acting is not to be expected , this was laughably bad and , honestly , provided all of the entertainment that was to be had . This is the plus side to the movie . Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing , lighting , and the editing.<br /><br />This movie provides way too many " What the % $ @ # is going on ? " moments . There are many moments , such as the mother having strange fits at dinner , and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie . Along the lines of dinner , someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served . During the meals and other inappropriate moments , the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside . Then cuts back in . And speaking of darkness outside , one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate , where apparently it is n't nighttime unless it 's raining . And speaking of darkness , a big problem with the movie is that it 's so poorly lit you ca n't see what 's going on half the time , which is more of a frustration than anything . In one of the climactic scenes , you ca n't even tell what you 're supposed to be seeing that 's so shocking.<br /><br />And when it comes to climactic scenes , Unhinged contains one of the worst . I 've seen people say " Wow , that surprised me , and that 's good . " I can say that the big reveal did surprise me , because I did n't see it coming . The reason I did n't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense . I wo n't ruin it for you , but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all , and all we found were more things saying that it was n't possible.<br /><br />All in all , this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it . I love crap horror movies , but this was too much .
0 I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read , about movies few will see . However , in this case , I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it . I just finished watching it only five minutes ago . This is , quite simply , one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life . The acting is horrible , a plot is nonexistent , and production values are poverty level at best . I know that even a low budget movie can be great , but not this one . There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan 's purposes -- more on - screen gore and slashing ! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off - screen . While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens -- especially the end scene -- there is simply not enough of it . The movie is just too long for it 's minimal content , too dialogue heavy , and consequently almost impossible to watch . What happens ? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare , three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered . Their car , of course , breaks down , and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people -- one of whom is the psychotic killer . All three are eventually murdered , one by one , off - screen , after what seems like an eternity of boring , slow - paced nonsense . As I said , the only things worth watching even once are the murders . Please do n't buy it or rent it just for that , and do n't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description . Save your money and your time .
0 When I rented " Unhinged " , I was expecting a gore movie . The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release ( I now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater ) . After finishing the movie , I wondered how it could even receive a video release.<br /><br />The plot is as follows : A group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree . These women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion , which contains an extremely sexist woman . Beyond this point , the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting . Lisa Munson , who plays the main character , looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards . The others acting is bad , but not nearly as bad as hers . Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique . Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling . This gets very annoying as the movie progresses . On top of all that , there is very little gore , which makes the box very misleading . < br /><br />Don't waste your time on this one . My rating : 1 out of 10
0 After the opening credits , there 's a black screen for about a minute . A minute of nothing , then a girl wakes up and takes a shower . Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert , after much padding , they hit something and skid off the road . They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair - bound old lady and her offspring . The killings are sadly very tame for a supposed Video Nasty . The twist ending silly and predictable . No one involved in the mess would ever make anything of note again . So there are still happy endings sometimes.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Sara Ansley gets topless , and Laurel Munson has full frontal on display < br /><br />My Grade : D
0 Did anyone edit this film ? Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes ? It 's OK though , I fell asleep watching it the first time . Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time . The plot is actually not the worst I 've seen , but it 's close . The acting is not the worst I 've seen either ... but it 's close . The production .... well , I can honestly say that it was the worst I had ever seen in my life ! Not trying to be spiteful , but Unhinged could have used some more production.<br /><br />Please do n't think I 'm a hater of horror films , or even that I did n't enjoy this film . I just felt I was laughing at the film much more than I felt I was laughing along with it . The gruesome moments were not too poorly done , but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.<br /><br />Characters seemed awkwardly developed , or ignored all together , twist ending was pretty bad , and the exposition took forever without exposing much.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding this movie.<br /><br />1/10
0 This was not enjoyable to watch . Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal ( boring ! ) job just so his stepson can go to film school , but his stepson decides that he 'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead . A documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot , not manipulate and comment with snide captions . The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious . And sad . The goal seems to be to make Frank appear dumb and pathetic , instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured.<br /><br />Essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is . It left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker .
0 The BFG is one of Roald Dahl 's most cherished books , but in this animated adaptation the magic just is n't there . This version remains pretty faithful to Dahl 's original story so one ca n't lay the blame on John Hambley 's script . If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation , the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice - overs . One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy , vibrant , fun - filled movie ..... instead , the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch . Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first ! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children 's ' classic.<br /><br />Young orphan Sophie ( voice of Amanda Root ) lives in a none - too - friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers . One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street . The figure realises it has been seen , so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed , placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night . Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country , and fears that he will eat her . But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG ( voice of David Jason ) . The BFG refuses to eat people , instead restricting himself to foul - tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers . However , Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast - every night , as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans . Sophie and the BFG become great friends , and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants . Together they go to the Queen of England ( voice of Angela Thorne ) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man - eating giants . The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.<br /><br />Jason voices the BFG quite well ( one of the few pluses in the film ) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality . The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired , with very little to bring the characters to life . Similarly , the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated - Sophie lacks appeal , and the giants are boringly designed ( and look almost indistinguishable from each other ) . Even the places are uninventive ; Giant Country especially comes up short , being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons . At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy , yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences . Little of Dahl 's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily . One chapter in the book deals with the BFG 's love of " whizzpopping " ( farting ) and is laugh - out - loud hilarious . In the film , the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling . I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest , fun and enjoyment , but what I got was pretty much the opposite ! This one is a failed misfire that simply does n't match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately , therefore , it must go down as one to skip .
0 This film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men ( one of them Burt Reynolds ) , a prostitute , and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in Miami . The convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time . The movie was mildly entertaining , but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under - exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening . In a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to " stretch " the developing process to save the images . Somebody did n't know how to operate a movie camera . Amazing that this film was even released !
0 If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed . I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red . I first thought my DVD players was messed up . It was n't . If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white . If you do n't you will never be able to get through the film . If you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of Pulp Fiction .
0 Follow - up to 1973 's far better " Cleopatra Jones " has statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson returning to her signature role as chic , super - tough narcotics agent , here busting a heroin ring in Hong Kong . Cross - pollination of blaxploitation action - flick and kung - fu B - movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags . The shoot - out finale is right off the assembly - line , and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before ( she 's still sexy , and she puts a unique spin on her comically - stilted dialogue , but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her -- she 's jaded ) . Stella Stevens plays the villainess this time ; she 's good , but ca n't match Shelley Winters in the predecessor . * * from * * * *
0 I 'd never heard of this , then found out it 's the man with the deadly lens , which I 'd heard of but not seen . Connery 's presence drove me to buy it , and it 's not good . It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash , but it just is n't that funny , unless you find the name General Wombat ( ? ) funny . It comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes , when it springs to life . There are many , many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his aides which do n't work . It 's almost as if the initial cut was too long , and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks , which i think are meant to be played for laughs , but again , are n't that funny . The location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV . I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo , Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this . Only laugh : Connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane . It makes Never say Never again look like genius .
0 This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re - naming . It does n't work at all . Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong . It 's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end . But there is also ( and that may have to do with the cuts ) an uneasy moving between genres . It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire . the ending may be funny but it 's also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence ( what little there is ) . So the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all . You can also see that in the very unsteady character development . You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles rather than one .
0 When the remake of When A Stranger Calls was out , obviously I was interested in watching the original . Then when I read about the original ( which I recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day ) I saw that the real money is on Black Christmas , which apparently beat everyone to the " the caller is in the house " punch . So I Netflix that , and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its " very long wait . " All this time I am getting more and more eager to see it ! Then one day , out of the blue , it finally arrives ! ... And it 's a total snore.<br /><br />Sure , maybe I had elevated expectations , but I do n't think it would have gained more had I seen it fresh . The thing is it 's Christmas in some Canadian college town , and there 's this sorority having a party . We see some killer - POV shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic . So we KNOW he 's in the house . Then we 're introduced to our characters-Olivia Hussey as the mousy , whiny , Canadian - accented Jess . Margot Kidder as the annoying , overtly aggressive alcoholic Barb . She 's so annoying even her mother dis - invites her for her Christmas festivities . There 's also this irritating Janis Ian clone ( " Phil " ) and this alcoholic den mother Mrs. Mac , seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house . We also meet Jess 's highly - strung boyfriend Peter , played by Keir Dullea of 2001 and Bunny Lake is Missing fame , though halfway through the film I was still asking myself " Which one 's Keir Dullea?" < br /><br />So it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls , but this was before email , so they could n't ask him to send a photo . Then-well , you know how they say those plastic dry - cleaning bags are not a toy ? One of the sisters finds that out the hard way . Do n't worry if you do n't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic - encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic-there'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film , obviously there to make you say " Oh my God ! There 's a corpse in the attic ! " Though after the first hour that changes to : " How come the dumb police have n't found the rather prominently - placed plastic - encased corpse in the attic ? " Especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house . Really , any time before CSI came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime ; the cops are so dumb . Fortunately some of them look like John Saxon.<br /><br />Anyway , after a lot more darn boring human drama , the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy - looking trap door that rests atop it ( those wily cats ! ) , for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble . Now we have two corpses up in the attic-hey , why do n't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now TWO corpses in the attic?<br /><br />So by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously , and tap the houses ' phone and station a cop outside . They inform Jess and her pal Janis Ian that if the obscene caller calls back , they need to keep him on the phone . Jessica , who has grown even more whiny , mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller " Who is this ? What do you want ? Who are you ? " after like the first 89 calls , when it is clear that he is not going to answer her . Is n't that like a sign a developmental disability ? The inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something ? And what 's he going to do , suddenly say " Oh yeah , hi , it 's Bob from the Laundromat ? " Dumb Jess.<br /><br />Spoilers ! Anyway , soon Janis Ian and Lois Lane ( Kidder ) are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces ( this film 's idea of gore ) , and idiot Jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked . Hello ? Are you being stalked or what ? Then the cops realize that the killer is in the house , and call Jess and tell her " do n't ask questions , just do as I say   walk to the front door and get out . " So what does moron Jess do ? Starts screaming " Phil ? Barb ? Phil ? Barb ? " Hey , great idea sister . Now why do n't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking ? Of course she does , and sees her former friends , all splashed with ketchup , prompting this viewer to scream at the screen : " Have a clue now?!" < br /><br />Now , obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place , and that it does n't move to the same pace we 're used to , and seeing a plastic - covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably WAS scary back in the day , and people were n't used to being stalked by psychopaths , so they would n't think to , you know , lock the doors or windows . And they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there . You see , people were stupid back in the 70s . We have to understand that . One of the big shocks is that we do n't even see our proto - Final Girl kill the psycho . But believe me , that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for . Spoilers end ! < br /><br />------ Hey , check out Cinema de Merde , my website on bad and cheesy movies ( with a few good movies thrown in ) . You can find the URL in my email address above .
0 Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there . He certainly was a charismatic fellow , one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew . But even McQueen ca n't save this turkey of a film , shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in St. Louis.<br /><br />McQueen 's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang . There 's more than a broad hint that there 's a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke . He 's not liked at all by the other heist members , mainly because of his lack of criminal resume . < br /><br />Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot , especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke , all pretty rough characters . That would certainly get my suspicions aroused.<br /><br />The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix . Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix did n't do much of anything . One of those two jokers decided Steve 's performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation . < br /><br />This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen . I 'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I ca n't believe they would have if they saw this.<br /><br />Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey .
0 Heavily re - edited and often confusing , the original screen version of Man On Fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years have n't made it any better . This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer , with Scott Glenn 's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year - old charge , the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family . An interesting cast - Joe Pesci , Brooke Adams , Danny Aiello , Jonathan Pryce - have all done better , the action is sluggish and sparse and only John Scott 's exceptionally fine score ( part of which turned up in the last reel of Die Hard ) makes a positive impression . One case where the remake ( made by Tony Scott , the original choice of director for this version ) is an improvement .
0 Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed , this film was a disappointment . Yes , it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud , boredom and frustration of the grunt , but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that 's ALL there is to this movie . There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous . It 's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute . One of the best World War II films , " Twelve O'Clock High , " has very little action . But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension . The exception to " The Story of G.I. Joe " is a brief battle segment ( titled " city under siege " on the DVD ) which takes place in Italy . Admittedly it is one of the most fast - paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie . But alas , the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight . Another turn - off is Pvt . Dondaro , played by Wally Cassell , who is meant to be a " romeo " but comes off a pervert . By contrast , Sgt . Warnicki is a sympathetic , if flawed , man . As he says to Capt . Walker ( Mitchum ) when volunteering for another patrol : " Every step forward is a step closer ... to home . " But that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink . Too bad the rest of the movie does n't do justice to some otherwise fine touches . As for Meredith 's portrayal of Pyle ... it is practically comatose .
0 I wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film . The only reason why I did n't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda . The beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing.<br /><br />The problem is with the rest of the picture . Alice Faye comes off quite hollow . Don Ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material , he comes off so terribly corny.<br /><br />The plot is a real stiff here with Ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to Faye.<br /><br />It seems that by playing the song and dance man , Ameche 's marriage gets a second change to reignite . Some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts.<br /><br />S.Z. Sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine . Ditto for J. Carrol Naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role.<br /><br />This is a chica chica boom bomb of a film .
0 This film was screen as part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival . I had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me.<br /><br />I actually like films that take time to develop , films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow . Stillness is good . But this film though was just plain slow.<br /><br />Credit must go to the two main actors . There was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people , misfits really , come together in a very awkward way . There were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them.<br /><br />I also liked the setting and the way it was shot . It was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film 's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters.<br /><br />I just do n't understand the ending . What was the point of it all ?
0 It 's interesting that all who ( so far ) seemed to like this film had no expectations -- I guess that 's the trick . In contrast with them , I had optimistic expectations , and that was a mistake . As soon as I saw how close to the faces the camera always was , I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director -- that 's always a clear sign of them , they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors . The actors in this film , though , had only one facial expression each . < br /><br />If the close camera was n't enough , the lack of light in the film killed it . The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark . So now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur , as well . " Ooh ooh , we 're going to light the set with a flashlight ! That will make it all seem intimate ! " No , that made it all seem invisible.<br /><br />On top of the serious technical flaws , there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed , and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated . ( Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany , but in Los Angeles , forget about it.)<br /><br />The fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards does n't indicate the quality of the film , but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals . I can assure you that this film wo n't win anything in the festival where I saw it . In fact , two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave ( this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer 's " total darkness " technique ) . But when the film shuddered on , instead , there were moans coming from the audience . And once the movie finally DID end , it was clear that it had n't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points . An earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity ( folding sheets , cutting vegetables , spreading honey on bread ) . Yeah , we get it , the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning.<br /><br />I recommend that audiences miss this one , it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie - goers .
0 As long as you can suffer it ! If you like watching people waking up , getting up , getting dressed , having a shower , preparing dinner , watching each other , having sex in the dark , then going back to bed to sleep ... if you like tacky flats , narrow bedrooms and kitchens , long minutes of silence .... if you like getting bored for two hours , feeling the thrill of " real intimate false art " , then you will like it . But if you do n't , just try to see a good movie , there are thousands . " As long as you are here " , but do we want to stay ? This German movie got the award of the Torino gay film festival : Italian journalists still do n't understand why the jury took such a bad decision , as the festival presented lot of talented movies . Maybe to be nice with a German , as they do n't often get awards ? Well , " The Lives of Others " did ... but this one is excellent but not gay . So maybe it is a question of fashion . Germans are they " in " again ? No matter what ? Or maybe only for a hustler 's glance of some directors ?
0 I liked this show ! I think it was nothing with wrong with it ! Only that Spidey do n't punch anyone but only for that the show does n't suck ! Some people only think this show is bad because of that . The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like X - men , The Punisher , Daredevil and Iron Man ! To bad Sandman never appear but i kinda like it ! Best Spidey show ever ! ! My favorite episodes are : 1 . Turning Point 2 . Spider Wars 3 . The Hobgoblin 4 . The Alien Costume 5 . Mutant Agenda < br /><br />But there are some episodes that was really really bad like : Rocket Racer and The Spot which was embarrassing to watch . And i do n't like Morbius and Hydro Man . First of Morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i do n't like vampires . And it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in Season 2 . Of course i have to mentioned Hydro Man ! He was terrible ! I rather see Sandman ! His last appearance was so terrible . And i do n't like Spidey as the Man - spider!<br /><br />But i guess everything than this was bad !
0 Watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994 - 1997 Spider - man cartoons made me realize why I could n't stomach it when it first came out.<br /><br />I'm from the old school , where the 1967 Spider - man cartoon was the best and still remains the best . ( I wo n't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible - give me traditional villains please.)<br /><br />The acting in the new stuff is lousy , read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting . Paul Soles , where are you now ? This guy was the best at voice acting for Spider - man . No one comes close . Watching Secret Wars , a great idea for a cartoon mini - series , made me wince . Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi . In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock , Red Skull has no German accent while Ock is heavy Russian ! The old Marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting . Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask , Captain America sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid . Paul Frees as the Thing in the 60s was the best Thing ever . The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them . Ever hear Mel Blanc 's son ? No way can he replicate his dad.<br /><br />The animation is clunky . Okay , so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds . Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad . Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic . I really do n't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are . < br /><br />The stories are badly written , and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible . Why , for example , when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other ? In Secret Wars , it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement . I can see if the hero was dark , unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher , but why the Thing and Iron Man ca n't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous , then the Torch joins in . This is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because ' everyone ' wants to see that stuff . Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off , but " Hey what are you doing here " and " You do n't tell me what to do " are LAME reasons . Another badly written scene is in The Wedding where Harry Osborne unmasks himself to spoil Peter 's wedding . That whole scenario was awful.<br /><br />Last , but certainly not least , is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - meaning no punches at all . In Secret Wars , the Lizard carefully ducked the Thing 's charge . But the Thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics . He must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons . Sure , these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 . That 's why they ca n't have punching , because mommy and daddy do n't believe in that type of violence . But you can blow things up , these cartoons will include that . As a kid before political correctness came in fashion I saw cartoons punching each other . What 's wrong with a punch to the chops ? Is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch ? I find this the most insulting of all when I watch the new stuff . They 've written out " the punch ' because we could all hurt ourselves.<br /><br />Kids , enjoy these cartoons all you want , I 've seen enough.<br /><br />3/10 rating
0 " Houseboat Horror " is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film , which carried the promotion ' See the movie that ca n't get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback . Badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters . It certainly delivers the gore : heads are split in half with a machete , throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe . If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try , but you have been warned . At least it 's better than Swedish " The Bleeder".4 out of 10 .
0 Houseboat Horror is a great title for this film . It 's absolutely spot - on , and therefore the only aspect of the film for which I can give 10 out of 10 . There are houseboats , there is horror , there 's even horror that takes place on houseboats . But if there were ever a tagline for the film poster , it would surely be ' Something shonky this way comes ... ' for Houseboat Horror is easily the worst Australian horror film I 've ever seen , not to mention one of the worst horror films I 've ever seen , and a fairly atrocious attempt at film - making in general . The good news is , it 's so bloody awful , it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity . It 's worth watching * because * it 's bloody awful.<br /><br />The category of ' worst ' comes not from the storyline , for the simple reason that there actually is one : a record producer , a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly - named Lake Infinity , a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in Victoria ( in reality Lake Eildon ) to shoot a music video . Someone is n't especially happy to see them there and , possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour , starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife . Even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this , < br /><br />On the surface , it looks like a very bog - standard B - movie slasher . You 've got highly - annoying youths , intolerant elders , creepy locals ( one of whom , a petrol station attendant , would easily win a gurning competition ) , and let 's face it , my description of the murderer could easily be Jason Voorhees . Ah , but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was Friday The 13th Part VII . Unfortunately , Houseboat Horror is completely devoid of both these things.<br /><br />But in the end , this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing . Fans of one - time ' Late Show ' and ' Get This ' member Tony Martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems ( ' Check out the view ... you'll bar up ! ' ) , while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed - I ca n't help wondering if writer / director Ollie Wood hoped it would actually become a hit . The horror element is comparable I think to B - slashers of the genre and particularly of the period , but there were times when I could n't help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off - screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on - screen.<br /><br />Indeed , if you 've been listening to Tony Martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself , I do n't think you 'll be disappointed . Any fans of ' so - bad - it's - good ' horror should not pass up the opportunity . Whether you 'll ' bar up ' or not though is another matter . If , on the other hand , you are in search of genuine excellence in the Australian horror genre , get yourself a copy of the incomparable ' Long Weekend ' and do n't look back .
0 I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say but this is the worst film I have EVER seen ! I 'm embarrassed to be from Melbourne , where the film was made . Diabolical acting , amateurish makeup effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack . As for the plot , well , that s even MORE stupid ! Some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was . There 's a reason they put these types of films on late night TV - because they 're utter rubbish ! Avoid at all costs .
0 This absolute trash is based so closely on the Friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy , accept for it being an Australian film with people who ca n't act.<br /><br />Once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon . Now , a number of years later , the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video . It is cliche - ridden and a waste of time and money , see it only out of curiosity , or if you 're an aspiring actor trying to learn how NOT to ( not be able to ) act . Lead role Alan Dale used to star in the television soap opera Neighbours , but ended up in The X Files - how did THAT happen ?
0 This movie should not classify as cinema . Although it is over 10 years old now , it should never , ever have gotten funding , and is a blight on the Australian Film Industry , which is now producing such brilliant films as " The Dish" < br /><br />The Actors can not act , The music is .. to be blunt , not music , the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through.<br /><br />Do not watch this film . It is a complete waste of your time .
0 Why was this film made ? Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were given , there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go - ahead . For goodness sakes , the actors cast in this film are Aussie b - grade celebs ( not actors , people like John Michael ' Hollywood ' Howson , the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday , and the voice - over guy in Countdown . But in saying that , this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves : none . The script is bad ( even for a self - confessed b - grade horror ) and the acting and film quality is worse . It often looks as though it is a home movie , but even a home movie has ' realism ' . Anyone interested in Australian cinema , please , for the love of God , pretend this film was NEVER made .
0 In this extremely low - budget ( I 've seen home movies made with better production value ) Australian utter rip - off of " the Burning " & " Friday the 13th " , a band is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat . They 're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before . This movie is even proclaimed to be ' the worst Australian film ever made ' in it 's DVD promotional material . That 's it 's only selling point ! Complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way . Perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers , but it still made me want to burn out my retinas.<br /><br />Eye Candy : a quick flash of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame shower scene < br /><br />My Grade : F
0 It is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made . A great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best.<br /><br />The editing drags on , there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take , and the soundtrack is unimaginative . So much more could have been done with this video movie . I guess they ran out of time , or videotape.<br /><br />Hand - held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them .
0 The threesome of Bill Boyd , Robert Armstrong , and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers , a working gal who sells salt water taffy . With the outbreak of World War I , the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar . The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going , with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one - liners and ' snappy ' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome . The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U - boat . These sequences are lively and well - filmed , but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy - drama with a flat ending . For fans of the stars only .
0 ... at least during its first half . If it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes , it would have been a much better and tighter film . The second half of the film is worth it , especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships , but it 's like a dull toothache getting there . Also , do n't watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it . She has an important role , but it 's a small one.<br /><br />The film starts out showing three New York City buddies working the tourist trade and also in good - natured competition for the hand of Sally ( Ginger Rogers ) , a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue . World War I breaks out , the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle , yet enlist in the navy anyways . The one of the three with the least industry as a civilian ( Bill Boyd as Baltimore ) winds up the commanding officer to the other two ( Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets ) . To make matters more complex , Sally has fallen in love with one of the three , but does n't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.<br /><br />The film is a little more interesting on board ship , mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself , and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable . However , James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby , especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.<br /><br />One real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design , or , I should say , the lack of it . In the scenes in New York just prior to WWI we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.<br /><br />In conclusion , if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission , you 've seen everything here worth seeing . The rest is padding .
0 I saw most of the episodes of RMFTM as a teenager on " Cliffhanger Theater " running after midnight on a local station some years ago , and then again when Mystery Science Theatre riffed on it in the early 90 's . Time has not been kind to it . < br /><br />I can certainly make allowances for the special effects , which were quite impressive for a low budget 50 's serial ( IMO Commando Cody 's flying scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman 's in his TV show ) . And I can also make allowances for the ahem , " acting " , and fight choreography - . except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men . He is incredibly miscast . He looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing , not the despotic ruler of an alien race . Even the corny dialog works all right - everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers , with no wasted time or pauses for things like " thought " or " introspection " . Since everyone does this , the viewer finds it immersive after awhile , and even to my modern sensibilities , it does n't bother much . < br /><br />What really irritates me is the writing and the plotting . I 'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon , or baking soda powered rocket ships , or a flying suit that has controls labeled " up / down " and " fast / slow " . I 'm not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter . I 'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory . And by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train , the plot goes through the same motions again and again . < br /><br />Dig it : Commando Cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting Earth ( or at least the USA ) against an insidious alien invasion . But his office has no guards or security checkpoints . They do n't even have locks on the front doors . So the bad guys walk RIGHT IN and beat the crap out of the Cody and his staff ... not once ( perhaps understandable ) but SEVERAL times . They even kidnap his female assistant on the second try . And they never get any smarter . To further prove my point , allow me to point out the way that Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone . He does this over and over and over . Cody also flies his ship to the Moon ( the woman assistant comes along to cook ) , stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back . Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray guns ... and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he could n't be bothered to lock it up . And so on.<br /><br />And you would think that if Cody 's efforts were so vital to saving the USA from the Moon Men , that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines , a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up , instead of just working with the local police all the time . This was supposed to be a military operation , but they act like it 's another episode of " Gangbusters " . < br /><br />It 's all rather hard to stomach . I appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre ( even though he loses half of his fistfights ) . But I just ca n't help yelling " DOOR ! LOCK THE DOOOOR ! ! " when the gangsters simply walk into his lab , or try to blow up the ship and there are NO security measures at the landing site in place ... not even a fence ( ! ) . < br /><br />Still , it 's OK . Of the three Republic serials I 've watched , " Phantom Creeps " had a better plot , and " Undersea Kingdom " had more atmosphere ( hah ! ) and a better hero than " Radar Men " , but it 's an OK time - waster . < br /><br />BTW ... why " Radar " men ? They did n't use radar , they used Atomic Ray Guns . Should n't the title have been " Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon ? "
0 The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950 's serials . The special effects are pretty cheap , the lunar rovers are obviously World War II surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them , and the like . The acting is only so - so . It does inspire the imagination of children , to whom I believe this was directed to . By today 's standards , it 's boring , cheap , and bad . There 's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters .
0 This serial is interesting to watch as an MST3 K feature , but for todays audience that 's all it is . I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952 . Considering that fact alone makes this a solid ( lowly ? ) 2 in my book . The cars used do n't even look contemporary , they look like stuff from the 30 's . It 's basically Cody ( the lone world 's salvation ? Sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else , like the military ) , anyway it 's Cody in his nipple ring flying suit against Graber and Daley two dumb*ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun that s pretty lame in its own right , enjoy . If you want to watch a really good serial see Flash Gordan , it 's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women , this has NONE of that . And Flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack . Something made in 1952 , this bad , deserves a 2 . Nuff said . give it a 6 if your watching it as a MST3 K episode , those guys have some good fun with it ; a tweak of the nipples here , a tweak there and I 'm flying ! And now as an added bonus , I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song as originally sung by Joel and his two character bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight The Enemy Planet:<br /><br />(Singing at the very beginning credits);<br /><br />(TOM SERVO SINGING ) YOUR WATCHING COMMANDER CODY .... HE IS THE NEW CHARACTER FROM REPUBLIC,<br /><br />HE GETS IN TROUBLE EVERY WEEK ... BUT HE 'S SAVED BY EDITING,<br /><br />JUST A TWEAK OF HIS NIPPLES ... SENDS HIM ON HIS WAY,<br /><br />A PUMPKIN HEAD AND A ROCKET PACK .... WILL SAVE THE DAY,<br /><br />(JOEL SINGING ) HIS LABRATORY IS A BOXING RING ... WHEN BAD GUYS COME TO MIX IT UP,<br /><br />SOMEBODY ALWAYS GETS KIDNAPPED ... AND CODY HAS TO FIX IT UP,<br /><br />HE DRINKS HIS TEA AT AL 'S CAFE ... AND FLIES ALONG ON WIRES,<br /><br />HE BEATS THE CROOKS AND FLIES WITH HOOKS ... AND PUTS OUT FOREST FIRES,<br /><br />(CROW SINGING)<br /><br />BAD GUYS BEWARE ... CODY IS THERE,<br /><br />YOU'LL LIKE HIS HAIR IT 'S UNDER HIS HELMUT ... AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD RHYME,<br /><br />THAT 'S THE END OF THE COMMANDER CODY THEME SONG ... SO SIT RIGHT BACK WITH A WILL OF GRANITE,<br /><br />AND WATCH CHAPTER EIGHT , CAUSE THAT 'S THE ENEMY PLANET
0 Oh , man , how low serials had fallen as by 1952 ! This dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed Annie Wilkes ( from Misery ) . Not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that were n't there in the previous chapter ( and that COULDN'T possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they would n't see the characters jump ) , but I think this serial has the World 's Record of Stock Footage . I mean , most of it is stock footage ! And not just from another serials ( apparently all the flying sequences come from King of the Rocket Men , and the cool " molten rocks " scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from Adventures of Captain Marvel ) , but from itself ! The whole " trip to the Moon " sequence ( which is probably the shortest ever , it 's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave Earth 's atmosphere ) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8 ! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes ! ( Ever wondered why MST3 K never did episodes 10 , 11 and 12 ? Well , they had to stop after 9 so they did n't have to do the whole thing again!).<br /><br />Don't get me started on the science factor . Prepare to see the sunniest Moon ever ! And Moon men that can not breathe on their own world ? What were they smoking ? < br /><br />And if this is not enough , it 's too talky and the stunts ( usually the best thing in serials ) are few and far . Visually - wise , am I the only one who thinks that Commando Cody 's bullet - shaped ( or is it lemon - shaped ) helmet is totally ridiculous - looking ? The Rocketeer 's was way cooler , no matter how bad that movie was ( and man , was it awful ) . The tank - like vehicle is n't much better , it looks like a bunch of kids made it for Halloween . The only positive thing I can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk ( hey , everybody has the right to be an hero ! ) , but then he 's so unappealing ... <br /><br />Not even worth watching for nostalgia 's sake . See Captain Marvel instead . 2/10.<br /><br />(BTW , check out the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women 's Lib pearl ) .
0 Really , truly , abysmally , garishly , awful . But actor Clayton Moore ( the movie Lone Ranger ) acquits himself competently as an actor . He 's the only one.<br /><br />A rare treat , for five minutes , if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects , southern California as " the moon " ( again and again and again ) , and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof . . . except that it 's clear that it isn't -- no humor here , except unintentionally.<br /><br />The dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects , and the costumes . . . well , enough said . Plot ? What plot ? Bad guy ( well , head bad guy ) and his henchmen , including his earthly agent called Krog ( listen carefully or you 'll suspect it 's a spoof on the name of McDonald 's founder Ray Kroc)and his unbelievably inept gunsels ( who , however , have handguns that never need reloading ; as does Commando Cody , so there are numerous firefight standoffs).<br /><br />Enjoy .
0 ... and Ethel Merman buffs , too , will love her loud , bossy vocals as the wicked witch Mombi , but this cartoon sequel to " The Wizard Of Oz " is bereft of real imagination , substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action ( and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video ) . Little Dorothy is whisked back to Oz , which has gone to ruin , and meets old and new friends . The inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less - inspired shows from Hanna - Barbera , however many of the songs are good , particularly Dorothy 's sweet lament " It 's a Far Away Land " , superbly performed by Liza Minnelli . You can count on Minnelli for energy , which is why the movie perks up whenever Dorothy is around . Much of it is unmemorable , and I 'm not even sure baby - boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long . As a curiosity item , just fair . * * from * * * *
0 My kids picked this out at the video store ... it 's great to hear Liza as Dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom . But there are too many bad songs , and the animation is pretty crude compared to other cartoons of that time .
0 The number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9 . They do n't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve . This one dropped a second body . That body , and Dean , drop about 20 feet from Sam but then they are right with Sam . Flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum , at night , and we can still see everything . It 's night but light is streaming through the windows . A ghost that died in 1960 's is making cell phones calls ? Come on ! There is no way Sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to Sam like it was n't his first visit . Sam and Dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and did n't do anything to help them . That does n't seem like a thing the Winchester boys would do . Oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls ' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt . < br /><br />While the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times I was not creeped out but nervous as Dean sat reading Elicots ' journal . I just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it 's sanctity . Elicot did n't appear . Maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place ( like Elicot 's office ) should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters . When they separate I want to scream ... ' that 's how you die ! Always stay together and watch each others backs ! ' but they do n't listen to me :o The Elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch . It 's prime - time show but I do wish the horror of Elicot strapping one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further.<br /><br />Especially because of the lighting goofs I gave this a 4 . Sudden darkness or the flickering of the whole scene 's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying . The lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking . I understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by Elicot touching an electric socket and the lights coming on . Have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room . Blue white lights flickering as electric arcs just like Elicot 's finger power . < br /><br />Seriously , MCG could have done better .
0 According to IMDb , as well as to every other website that holds a review ; this " thing " does n't have a director . Well , that would surely explain a lot ! Just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra - thin storyline about devil - worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium . " Hardgore " is a prime example of totally demented 70 's smut , as it 's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration . Horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70 's and pornography as well , so why not combine the two ? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who 's committed to a mental asylum , and from the first night already , she 's drawn into a network of drugs , psychedelic orgies , rape , torture and dildo - action . Really , a LOT of dildo - action . The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her , but she has her throat slit even the same night . The horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated , going from laughably un - scary Satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks . The photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish , but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm - firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs ? Leading lady Justina Lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body , but most of her co - stars ( male & female ) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls .
0 Former private eye - turned - security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession . His assignment : to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California ... and apparently wanted by suit - and - tie racketeers . Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre , without enough sting or wit ( or involving plot dynamics ) in the screenplay . Director and co - scenarist Paul Magwood ( who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement ) does n't give off the impression of having high regard for the ' 40s films his " Chandler " was borne from ; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled , but also bitter - tinged and somewhat indifferent . The handling is curiously , commendably low - keyed , and Warren Oates is well - cast as this ' 70s variant on the ' private dick ' archetype , but the movie does n't have any snap . Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast -- though neither has much to do , and Caron 's hot - and - cold running character is exasperating throughout . Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold , nice location shooting , but it fails to come to any kind of a boil . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I saw this film when it was first released . The memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years . I did n't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when I saw it , so I consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day- sentiment confirmed , the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent , indecipherable , and uninspiring . A little research reveals that the producer was star Leslie Caron 's husband , thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film . The film 's roster of many capable actors - Caron , Warren Oates , Scatman Crothers , Gloria Grahame , and James Sikking among others - suggests that it holds some promise . But the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay . The " mystery " implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene . The movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller , but never settles upon one or the other . The sense of suspense is entirely absent . The main characters settle on playing dry , emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever . The cinematography is pedestrian . The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters , the plot , and , in the end , the film itself . I am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase . I hope that if TCM finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4:00 am slot .
0 In the many films I have seen Warren Oates , I have come to a definite conclusion , here is one talented individual . I first saw Mr. Oates back in the 1960 's television series called Stoney Burke . From then on , I followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles . That happened in 1974 , when Sam Peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called ' Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia . ' Of course , his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in ' The Wild Bunch ' . I have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic , that is until I saw him in this flop . The movie is called " Chandler " , a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950 's created by Raymond Chandler . Because , the synopsis said it was about a hard nose Private Eye , I was immediately interested . However , I sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull , dis - interesting , slow pace , twisted , confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self . Collectively and with some of Hollywood 's best supporting stars , such as Alex Dreier , Mitch Ryan , Gordon Pinsent , Charles McGraw , Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers , this movie had enough power to reach Mach five , however , it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where . As a result , one of my favorite actor 's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground . * *
0 The " Trivia " page on IMDb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re - cut by the studio to " simplify the plot " . If so , that effort was a total failure , as this is one of the most incoherent narratives I 've ever seen in a film -- I 'd hate to have seen it before the plot was " simplified." < br /><br />It 's sad to see Warren with so little character to go on that even he ca n't do anything with the inept material . It 's interesting to see Caron in ' 70s mode instead of her Hollywood - era glamour garb and persona , but it 's sad to see her haplessly wander through this doing - a- favor - to - her - producer - husband dreck . She would actually later hook up with and marry the director , instead -- who , you 'll note , never directed anything again , but did strictly 1st or 2nd A.D. work in TV from here on out . That oughta tell you enough right there.<br /><br />I call this " interesting " because I have an automatic fondness for American films of this period , and this role does add perspective to Oates ' otherwise fantastic 1971 output ( Two- Lane Blacktop , The Hired Hand ) . But the " 1940s detective as fish - out - of - water in 1970s L.A. " theme , which is the only thing the movie really has to say , is sold in way too heavy- handed a manner . A similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in Altman 's The Long Goodbye . And as far as Oates playing a hard - bitten guy on a doomed errand , three years on , he would give his definitive performance in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia . If you have n't seen those , do n't waste your time with this !
0 Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same year 's THE PUBLIC ENEMY . She will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hood 's girl who finds that her past will always be with her.<br /><br />In some ways , this looks a bit antique for 1931 , almost as if you are looking at 1928 's famously inert LIGHTS OF NEW YORK . But do n't be fooled . Although Ted Tetzlaff 's photography is still in the big scenes , there 's lots of movement , indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set - ups to them . But in competition with the fast - paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at Warner 's , this attempt to bring the woman 's viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker does n't work , nor is Mae Clarke the actress to carry the effort .
0 VERY BAD MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... THe plot is predictable , and it 's EALLY cheesy , the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason I did n't give the movie a one , other than that ... this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch ..... I feel while watching the movie , the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of cliché .... bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah , but I feel it might have been at least a little better if it just was n't so cheesy , very poorly portrayed from idea to screen , i think . The Plot is somewhat predictable at times , tho the dancing I can say AT TIMES , is pretty good , The break dance battle twist was good ..... IF u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5 ... lol
0 because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story , without having to listen to banal dialogue , and be finished in 10 minutes max . Come to think of it , even 10 minutes is too much to waste on Enid - Blyton - meets - struggling - wanna - be - artists . Vomit .
0 Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society , in a life without meaning , purpose or direction.<br /><br />I watched this because of all the stellar reviews , but I 'm afraid I must have missed something . The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people , getting high and contributing nothing to anyone 's life . She 's not interesting or exciting . She 's just useless.<br /><br />I've seen and known enough people like that : there is no secret meaning to what they 're doing . They are just lazy bums . I would n't want Mona anywhere near me , as she tends to steal anything that is n't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch . Sure she 's enigmatic - because there is n't anything to her . Lots of junkies , winos and bums I 've seen are enigmatic ; I would n't want to see a film about them either.<br /><br />Possibly there is something there that I totally missed . Otherwise I 'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art .
0 The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks . Like the vagabond , the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly . Mona , the lazy , sullen , and drug - addicted title character , is not likable and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting . Although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why Mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle , her motivations are never really clear . The episodic nature of the film , involving some random characters , becomes tiresome after a while , making it seem much longer than its running time . It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men .
0 This movie . . . I do n't know . Why they would take such an indellible character as Pippi Longstocking and cast the singularly charmless Tami Erin , I will never know . Why they would spend money on art direction and some not - all - that - bad special effects , then not bother to edit it properly , I will never know . Why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period , and sometimes bizarrely not , why they commissioned SUCH bad songs , why the script does n't make any sense whatsoever ( not even on a silly , children 's film level ) . . . . what were they thinking ? ? Nothing about this movie is quite as it should be . Every single part is dubbed ( and always poorly , ) every sound effect is slightly wrong , every edit is in the wrong place , every performance is bad in some way . It does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere , despite all the problems , but it NEVER captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgren 's creation .
0 This is another North East Florida production , filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation . I was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes . The film is pretty , and pretty bad . Tami Erin is cute , but overacts . Eileen Brennan overacts even more . Good for small kids , or for those who like fluff in large doses . A 4 from the Miller - Movies formula .
0 This appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 . It looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier , and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture . I weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this .
0 while watching this movie I got sick . I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure . when my wife came to Sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh . but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again . it is terrible from beginning to it 's end . how can they manage to make it soo bad . well I guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi . may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast . burn the movie and save the kids . if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh . WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON , sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. when read the " spoilers " explanation , " ' spoiling ' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film . " well I guess the director stands for this ... you are looking at this movie at your own risk .. it is really a waste of time ...
0 It 's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old Indian traditions . At times it is clear how most of the ' doctors ' are charlatans , even lying about how they do n't charge their clients . While they are wearing their gold watches , the ' donation ' box is mandatory . Notice that there are only a couple of people who get ' cured ' while we see quite a few cases.<br /><br />Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee , while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru / month .
0 This documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers ' offices and treatment preparation . There is no denying the grinding poverty in India and desperation of even their wealthier clients . However , as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general , this film fails miserably . Although Indian clients mention having seen " aleopathic " doctors , those doctors are not interviewed , and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value-- " the doctor said there was no cure , " " the doctor said it was cancer " etc . Well , " no cure " does n't mean " no treatment , " and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have ? The film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in America . There it is reduced , apparently , to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered Wall Street job can make your stomach hurt .
0 The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist . He imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism , making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual . The character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical B movie villain.<br /><br />The story line is nothing to write home about , and many scenes are dull . What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper . Kosleck 's talkative , philosophical character is contrasted with Hatton 's low key , monosyllabic approach . The character of the Creeper is n't developed much beyond a basic monster level , but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story.<br /><br />This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid , so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for it . It 's worth seeing once , anyway , for those who enjoy Forties horror movies .
0 This is a typical late Universal Horror flick : its technically comptent , if by the numbers , with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting . The most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of Rondo Hatton , a man with a bone disease as the film 's " monster " . Its sad to see this man exploited , but he probably made good use of the money they paid him . Hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped , as I more often felt pity over fear or even loathing . Martin Koslack is on board as the film 's mad artist , and he is very amusing in this part . I for one enjoy seeing Koslack in just about anything ; for some reason the man amuses me . The only other part of the film that entertained me is the film 's absurd take on the art world . Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists ; this is side by side with the film 's male " hero " who is an " artist " who paints ... get this ... pin up girls . Somehow our hero 's work is reviewed side by side with the villan 's absurdist sculpture . Also amusing is the film 's chief nasty critic , who at one point claims that he despises the hero 's pin up art because " women like that do n't exist " to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just does n't get out enough . Finally , there 's a bit of a subplot about the heroine 's ( who is an art critic herself ) domestication by the leading man .... completely anti - feminist and ridiculous to witness . Overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements .
0 This low - grade Universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming DVD release but , intended as part of a collection of similar movies that I already had in my possession , I decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release . Which is just as well , since the end result was not anything particularly special ( if decently atmospheric at that ) : for starters , the plot is pretty weak  even though in a way it anticipates the Vincent Price vehicle THEATRE OF BLOOD ( 1973 )  albeit without any of that film 's campy gusto . What we have here , in fact , is a penniless sculptor ( Martin Kosleck )  whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat !  who , upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic Alan Napier 's vitriolic pen one time too many , decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river . However , while contemplating just that action , he is anticipated by Rondo Hatton 's escaped killer dubbed " The Creeper " and , naturally enough , saves the poor guy 's life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude ! Although it is supposedly set in the art circles of New York , all we really see at work is Kosleck and commercial painter Robert Lowery ( who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl Joan Shawlee over and over in banal poses  how is that for art ? ) who , conveniently enough , is engaged to a rival art critic ( Virginia Grey ) of Napier 's ! Before long , the latter is discovered with his spine broken and Lowery is suspected ; but then investigating detective Bill Goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of Lowery 's work ( I did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed ! ! ) so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be ! In the meantime , Kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting Hatton 's uniquely craggy  and recognizable  visage which , needless to say , attracts the attention of the constantly visiting Grey ( we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column )  much to the chagrin of both artist and model . Bafflingly , although The Creeper is fully aware of how Grey looks ( thanks to her aforementioned haunting of Kosleck 's flea - bitten pad ) , he bumps off Shawlee  who had by then become Goodwin 's girl !  in Lowery 's apartment and , overhearing Kosleck talking to ( you guessed it ) Grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police , sends the slow - witted giant off his deep end  even down to destroying his own now - completed stony image . Curiously enough , although this was Hatton 's penultimate film , his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet " introducing " !
0 Although this is n't a " great film , " there 's something compelling and memorable about it . Like another commenter on the film , I saw this in childhood . It 's been thirty three years since 1952 , but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title . See it if you have the opportunity . You 'll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades . More than any other film , this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century " progress . " It 's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one . Furthermore , it 's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time .
0 Although i had heard this film was a little dry , I watch whatever Scott Bakula is in . At the start of this film I had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable Scott - gets - girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great . The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever . I kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding , right up until when the credits rolled and I realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending . Unfortunately i was left regretting that i 'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott !
0 Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child . It`s being shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight , I wonder if ... yup it`s a TVM < br /><br />You`ve got to hand it to TVM producers , not content on making one mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different . The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ? And being a TVM she answers that the reason is " That people change " rather than say something along the lines like " I`m a right slapper " or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex " as does happen in real life divorce cases . And it`s young Sam I feel sorry for , not only are his parents divorced but he`s as thick as two short planks . Actually since he`s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he`s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer , unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you , and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unfunny . If only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as Orwell said " Ignorance is strength " . Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! Is this character development or poor scripting ? I know what one my money`s on . And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ? But as it turns out during a plot twist it`s the mother who`s the dummy . Then there`s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
0 The plot sounds vaguely interesting ... a scientist ( Bateman ) discovers how to transplant animal eyes and optic nerves into other animals , like humans . A young man ( Monteith ) is blinded saving a coworker at work - the scientist gets a call from a doctor that the young man is a good candidate to be the first human recipient . The recipient starts becoming more and wolf - like , but the effect is nothing more than " weird eyes " and running at night with dogs ! ( for the whole movie ) The budget is too low , the dialogue too stilted ( I laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous talk ) , and the acting too inept . Long portions of the movie are nothing more than dreamy looks , eerie music and interspersed clips of wolves in the wild . Way too long even at 90 minutes , boring , and devoid of ideas.<br /><br />The military want to use the eye transplants to give wounded soldiers back their eyesight , and presumably want to militarize the technology . There 's a silly subplot about a beautiful Indian girl ( Korey ) who thinks she can help , using Indian wisdom about the wolves . They make love while music heavy on drums and Indian chanting is heard - crazy , man ! The love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder - who edited this turkey ? ! A grouchy " medicine man " who spouts platitudes seems to do little , except for adding atmosphere.<br /><br />Here 's two ridiculous scenes . A worker at the research lab goes into the animal room to discover the monkeys have been let out of their cages . She gets scared , looks left at the monkeys , turns right , turns left , turns right , turns left .. this goes on for a while ( who edited this ? ? ) . RUN OUT OF THE DAMN LAB ! It was so stupid I started laughing . Another ridiculous scene - our hero is at home , escapes out a window as the heavily armed military arrive - he leaves the window open , the military guys go to the open window , look out the window , they say " looks like he was here " , and LEAVE ! He went out the open window , guys ! ! Crazy.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie , military guys are firing machine guns over and over at trees , when obviously nothing is there - easier to place the squibs I guess . They have 6 machine guns which have cut down trees , but decide to fight our hero with 1 knife ! ! ! Shoot the guy ! ! Who wrote this trash ? ? There 's a pointless confrontation at the end , and believe me I 'm not spoiling anything for you - there 's not enough plot to spoil.<br /><br />I figure the whole thing was a tax write - off or a rush job to make use of unused budget money left over from some better movie .
0 I hired out Hybrid on the weekend . What a disappointment ! A stupid lame attempt at a tele - movie . The guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running { he did a lot } looked like he was eating those minty sweets ... with his backside ! The wolf contacts he wore were great , though I feel the actor relied on them too much , as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all . The wise native American Indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen . Talk about a sour cow ! She smiled about once for the entire film , and I think that is because she had sex . The sex scene was lame too . They may as well have shown blowing curtains , if you can dig that.<br /><br />Last of all , and this is a big pet hate of mine , on the cover and the DVD menu , the losers digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy . They were nowhere to be seen in the film . :(
0 Hybrid starts as water treatment planet security guard Aaron Scates ( Cory Monteith ) is involved in an accident which leaves him blind . Luckily it just so happens that brilliant scientist Dr. Andrea Hewitt ( Justine Bateman ) who works for Olaris has developed an operation to transplant organs from one species to another , Hewitt decides Aaron would be perfect for her first human experiment . Hewitt & her team transplant the eyes of a Wolf into Aaron & he miraculously regains his sight . Brilliant , right ? Well , no not really since Aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of Wolves & starts to develop a lust for blood . Aaron escapes the Olaris building & goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go & a full scale search is mounted to capture him ... <br /><br />Directed by Yelena Lanskaya this is yet another Sci - Fi Channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way , I think it probably started out life as a straight ' Creature Feature ' but ended up as one of the most boring & dull Sci - Fi Channel films I have seen that does n't even feature any sort of monster or creature . Hybrid is awful , the script is terrible & I am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to . The initial set - up is OK with Aaron getting Wolf eyes but then Hybrid ditches the sci - fi elements & becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on Aaron 's mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some Native American woman . Yep , you do n't think the Sci - Fi Channel could make a film about Wolves & put loads of rubbish about Native American mythology in there as well do you ? The dynamics of the character 's is bizarre , Aaron is shown as the persecuted hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film & is a fairly unlikable , ungrateful & annoying person while Dr. Hewitt is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives Aaron back his sight & does nothing but try to help him . I mean Aaron is given back the gift of sight yet Hewitt is the villain ? Also the regular Sci - Fi Channel staple of US military intervention is present , the problem is why do they want Aaron so badly ? He is n't a soldier & while he has Wolves eyes to help him see in the dark he 's utterly unremarkable . The script ca n't make it 's mind up whether it 's all in Aaron 's mind or it 's real , the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked ( rememeber this was made for telly ) Aaron running through a forest with a pack of Wolves set to some horrible music that I think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny . There are so many things wrong with Hybrid , it 's slower than hell , there 's virtually no action , there 's no Werewolves & the film goes round in circles trying to get into Aaron 's mind yet it 's all so ridiculous , silly & boring you wo n't care one bit & there 's never any explanation as to why despite just having Wolves eyes transplanted Aaron starts to develop other Wolf senses.<br /><br />As a diabetic I have problems with my eyes , hell I have had major surgery on my right eye & I can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be puffed up , you would n't be able to open it & it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye transplants as soon as Aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no swelling or even redness . There are no special effects , no blood or gore or violence & nothing to excite you . In fact now I think about it there 's nothing even remotely horror or sci - fi feeling about this , it feels like a drab film of the week.<br /><br />Filmed in Manitoba in Canada the film looks OK but is bland & forgettable . The acting is poor from all involved none of whom I have seen before & hopefully never again.<br /><br />Hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously marketed as some Werewolve ' Creature Feature ' but is far from that & most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in stitches .
0 I could n't believe that this movie dates from 2007 , it had all the looks of a below - average seventies horror - flick . Did n't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI ? ! ? Did n't they know that in the post - millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi - movie should at least be a little bit graphic ? Or did I get the purpose wrong , was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal , bound together in the big cycle of life , or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature , or something like that ? ? It does n't really matter , either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts.<br /><br />First of all : the premise is very improbable . If at a given time you 're capable of replacing a total eye , no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time , that 's totally unprofessional . And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient ? ! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans , and make the victim look like a freak ? ! By the way , I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy - like normal dark eyes , could n't they have waited for such a specimen ? The story is lame , it 's about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eye - transplants , which suddenly makes him feel like the donor - wolf ( or at least , that 's what I make of it ) and then he 's being chased by some military men . Especially this last bit is ridiculous . I mean , I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment ( imagine soldiers with night - vision eye - sight ! ) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient , it 's beyond me why they 're out to kill him . Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient ? ( a volunteering soldier maybe ? ? ) . And why try to kill everyone else that 's involved with poor Aaron , is n't that a bit steep ? ! Who the hell are these militaries anyway , I hope not the US army or the government , they behave like psychopaths , walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons , raiding private apartments like they 're after some public enemy # 1 , and displaying during the ultimate show - down in the woods a total lack of discipline , like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren , panicking and shooting randomly around.<br /><br />Aaron , for some unfathomable medical reason , feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes . Why would that be ? ? ? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves . What is this ? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor - wolf are situated in it 's eye - balls ? ! ? And that the recipient of these eye - balls also adopts the wolf 's craving for red ( life- ) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all - fours like a cat ( can a wolf even DO that??!).<br /><br />The acting ( or the lack thereof ) did n't help the credibility of all this either : everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls , especially this Indian girl , she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression ( vexed ) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature , and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her ( but hey , there probably had to be at least one love - scene ! ) . I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith , who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face , but they did n't give him much to go with . He has to run around bare - chested for more than half of the movie , which could have been fun to watch , but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique , Monteith really should leave his shirt on . His ( few ) killings and attacks are hardly shown , we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there 's another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest . Not much for a modern sci - fi horror ! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman , and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty - something lady . She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions , but they made her character a kind of a wimp , who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries . What a pity that the script did n't make her stand up a bit more ! < br /><br />In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie , hardly scary or thrilling , with unbelievable goings - on , a lot of overlong National Geographic - like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes ( who cares ? ! ? ) , some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments . I guess the word " superfluous " covers it all .
0 This movie has some fatal flaws in it , how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable . Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr. 's office , is just bad writing or bad editing . < br /><br />Very very very predictable movie . < br /><br />I am not sure how this film got made , except it is was filmed in Canada , and probably received a government grant . < br /><br />I must say the person playing Aaron , Cory Monteith , did a good job.<br /><br />Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time , but otherwise , it is a movie no actor would want on their resume .
0 The plot sounded like it had promise . To be honest I did not watch the entire movie . After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision . Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion ? The answer was clearly NO ! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it . Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant . It was because the movie was badly written , acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes . When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying " If you ca n't run with the big dogs do n't leave the porch " kept running through my bored mind . Save yourself the time and skip this movie . I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money , time , energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema .
0 When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking , " ok its gon na be a good werewolf movie " but it was not . it was not scary at all ! acting was good , plot was horrible , the military bid was just plain stupid . I think the SCI - FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap . The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf , instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor 's throat out . If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies , there all positive , but this one is not simply because the story was terrible . One out of 10 max . I m sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick , but i bet you did n't expect this . Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie , heck , any movie that s on the sci - fi channel is better than this movie .
0 My Score for this crap : 1 / 10 1 for the technical only . Everything else is very bad . < br /><br />Another film that makes no sense . Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission . < br /><br />While it 's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth , they are among the biggest liars on the planet , it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic . < br /><br />We must believe that taking people for morons . Perhaps it was reason to believe , since 99 % of the films are crap . Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios . < br /><br />When you look at the price we give Oscars , we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others . < br /><br />And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense . But it was not for education and health . < br /><br />If you still want to listen to this s**t , press super Fast Forward button ( at least 20X ) .
0 This film is probably pro - Muslimization . < br /><br />Why do I write that ? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother . He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village . In the end of the film he seemingly is a Muslim because of his head - wear , that he has kept his amulet , and his general clothing . He has a six year old child , who wears the same head - wear and therefore is probably a Muslim , although the mother is a Christian . The main character thus chooses to , it seems , to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim . No one of the other male main characters , which are Christians , seems to breed a child . There are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it , it therefore seems .
0 From the moment the film begins , already there is a discrepancy . As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the middle East , and is also an international film , one would expect proper accents portrayed . This is not done as the majority of the cast sound American . Also , I find the acting to be rehearsed at best , the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning . Who is who ? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery . If you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past ( albeit the lack of accents ) then this movie is worth a rent . If you 're looking for a movie as epic as Kingdom of Heaven , then look elsewhere .
0 I m still in doubt if this is just a horrible movie or the worse movie i ever saw . Actors are painful and its impossible to get into the text.<br /><br />Don't waist your time into this movie .

0 Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the marvelous SALLY ( 1929 ) , the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE ( 1931 ) and this trifle - SUNNY ( 1930 ) . It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance numbers , she only sings two songs ( WHO ? and ONE MAN ALONE ) . The rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned , although we can hear the latter in the background scoring . Miller looks overweight and amateurish here - no star quality at all . Even her dancing is cloutish . The film is very badly written , stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations . If you 're interested in Miller as a performer , by all means , check it out , but for general entertainment , stay away .
0 I have only recently been able to catch up with the films of Marilyn Miller since they are not shown on TCM in the UK.I have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s . What was she really like . To some stars of this era like Jolson some of the magic still shines through , but alas not for Miller . Her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed , her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler seem like Hepburn . Even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted . So we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal . She was being paid $ 500000 for this!So i have only two conclusion . Either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all . I think that the truth is nearer the later than the former .
0 There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you . You do n't need to tell the audience what to think , because they 'll see it . The action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former . And it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals . Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support . And he may have been right , it lacks a basic credibility : 70s Edinburgh was n't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath . From the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together , it 's all too contrived for my taste .
0 I got lured by the title ... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism , instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rowdy Scot.<br /><br />The leading character is n't given much psychological depth , unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen - like poetry as psychology.<br /><br />It was a shame , because the core of the story could have been good , with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth.<br /><br />Sadly , the general idea seems to be more like " I 'm the way I am because that 's the way I am " . And the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower - class man makes things even worse . Resorting to the overused cliché of the " poète maudit " reeks of a quick fix , a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart , artsy and meaningful.<br /><br />But " 16 years of alcohol " is n't much smart , artsy or meaningful ... The leading character does n't evolve at all , and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation . Just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue.<br /><br />The movie borrows heavily from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting , but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness , not even for a few seconds.<br /><br />Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story , and neglected the rest , giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain .
0 You can often tell a movie did n't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator . This film features this device throughout . Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art - house . Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance . Everyone else is okay.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night , though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes . Bless .
0 This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD part way through.<br /><br />I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first , even though it managed to be both shallow , clichéd and stupid .. AND joyless , plodding and pretentious.<br /><br />It was like an After School Special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him ... creepy and sad , with voice - over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry ... and some singing , and ... no , really , the poor child 's suffering ... <br /><br />Enough , already , especially when it morphed into a brazen , clumsy , and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff . And did I mention the singing?<br /><br />This is n't the worst film I 've ever seen , but certainly the one I 've felt least compelled to sit through . I do n't recommend it to anyone .
0 This movie was terrible . The first half hour is much like a ... well , apologies for the lack of articulation , but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange . The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork ! Supposedly it was a tribute , as per the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist 's wall , however " ripoff " is the more appropriate word . The movie felt as though it was torn right from the Kubrick classic , only filmed through a new director 's eyes . A blind director . Unfortunately when it stops its massacre of Kubrick 's work , the film gets even worse . As another commentator said , the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat . Arrogant , self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel.<br /><br />Perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie . I felt absolutely nothing for this guy . And I 'm an alcoholic , so I figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him , it would be me . Awful character development , dialogue and plot.<br /><br />The worst part about this movie is the title . For a film called " 16 Years of Alcohol " , the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick . See first paragraph - it was such a butchering of A Clockwork Orange I ca n't get over it . A more suited title would have been " 16 Years of Violence , " or , even better , " A Clockwork Banana".<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie . If you disregard my advice and take it out anyway , drink . Trust me .
0 This film was terrible . I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse , but very few.<br /><br />From the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it , like a kid with too many toys . There was the endless , boring repetitive narration , slow motion , freeze frame , flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better.<br /><br />It is called " 16 years of alcohol " , but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense . The story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by Mr Jobson , previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making as much sense as this film does.<br /><br />I found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better I carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better off not bothering .
0 I found this film embarrassing to watch . I felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if I could n't pick up the subtleties I needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly.<br /><br />Having a father who IS still an alcoholic , I did n't really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such . Alcoholics , true alcoholics are very lonely people inside , in my opinion of course . They find it hard to communicate , something that the main character had no problem with really , except he DID have a problem saying I love you at one point- which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character . He was constantly surrounded with people too ! ? < br /><br />I felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil . I could n't connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father . I felt nothing at all when it had finished , just relief it was over.<br /><br />Kevin McKidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead ! The clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick . McKidd was too old for the teen , they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult McKidd.<br /><br />On a good note , I felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film ! !
0 This film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment , promising to develop into something worth hanging on for . But it does n't . It 's flat , self conscious , unimaginative and tedious.<br /><br />A series of set images and backdrops do n't make a film , they make a calendar . This kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary ( " It 's TRUE it REALLY happened " ) not only fails to entertain , it fails to convince , so it does n't even function as social history . Clichés co - mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish , the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly . The characters are one dimensional , never developing to the extent that one feels for them . The director 's ego is the largest character in this film .
0 This film was a yawn from titles to credits , it 's boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted ! Admittedly this was director Richard Jobson directing debut , but who on earth green - lit a script as poorly developed as this one ? Looks like another money down the drain government project ( Scottish Screen are credited surprise , surprise ) . I nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one . Please , please mister Jobson what ever you 've been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film , go back to it !
0 I feel like I 've been had , the con is on , do n't fall for it . After reading glowing reviews ( the Director was a film reviewer with Sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews ) I expected solid acting , atmosphere , suspense , strong characterization , an intriguing plot development and poetic moments . Sadly , ' Sixteen years of Alcohol ' , does n't deliver on the critics promises , for the most part , sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects ( what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for ? ) , unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration , cliché edits and camera angles.<br /><br />'Sixteen years of Alcohol ' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Scotland , but it 's straight downhill from here . Unfortunately , instead of spending some time building atmosphere , creating characters we might care about , or building suspense - the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice - over 's . The lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted - the audience does n't care what happens to them , desperate Actors do desperate things ... like this movie!. To make matters worse , the ' homage 's ' ( typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters ) are either utterly cliché or unconvincing . The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action.<br /><br />For some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying . I still watched the whole damn thing!<br /><br />I guess I liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter - cut with weird and abstract , sometimes pointless scenes . You do n't need a huge budget to make truly moving film , so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film , half a million is not a little bit of money ... SO NO EXCUSES ! Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... Or their agents were thinking!<br /><br />Pass on this turkey unless you 're masochistic or mindless anyway .... NOT MY THING < br /><br />1.5/10
0 As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.<br /><br />We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world . But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work . And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new , inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta 's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment . I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse.<br /><br />This movie is so bad I would n't even bother renting it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth .
0 Boring , badly written Italian exploitation flick . Lots of nudity , gore and awful acting . The werewolf makeup was the only thing that would raise a laugh . Complete rubbish - even for fans of cheesy Italian horror . Please avoid .
0 Robert Colomb has two full - time jobs . He 's known throughout the world as a globetrotting TV reporter . Less well - known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full - time philanderer.<br /><br />I saw ` Vivre pour Vivre ' dubbed in English with the title ' Live for Life . ' Some life ! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life : one mistress on her way out , one on her way in , and the cheated wife at home . It helps that Robert is a glib liar . Among his most useful lies are ` I 'll call you tomorrow ' and ` My work took longer than planned . ' He spends a lot of time and money on planes , trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons . You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down.<br /><br />Some may find his life exciting , but I thought it to be tedious . His companions , including his wife , Catherine , are all attractive and desirable women . But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful , you wonder if he 's enjoying all this.<br /><br />Adding to the tedium is considerable footage that does n't further the plot . There are extended sections with no dialogue or French - only dialogue . We see documentaries of wars , torture , and troop training interspersed with the live action . When Robert 's flight returns from Africa , we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal.<br /><br />Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film . Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection . It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career . I ca n't find fault with Yves Montand 's performance of what was basically an amoral bum.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch 's novel techniques . In a hotel room scene , the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue . We catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room . In another scene set on a sleeping car of a train , Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower . Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news , but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train . I sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news . I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa . The cinematography of those scenes and of those in Amsterdam was superb.<br /><br />I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress . I 've named the project FIFTY : 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years . As best I can determine , this film , like the other forty - nine I 've identified , has not been on video , telecast , or distributed in the U.S. since its original release . In my opinion , it is worthy of being made available again.<br /><br / >
0 As much as I like Japanese movies this one did n't just cut it ... A movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot.<br /><br />The photography is OK , though I 've seen much better sword fight scenes in other Japanese movies , the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters did n't convince me at all . The soundtrack is so weak you do n't even notice its presence . But worst of all was the way the plot evolved . I have to admit that , at some times , I had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on ... Anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence.<br /><br />All in all , if your looking for an action Japanese movie this is n't it . Its very slow , with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
0 There is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film.<br /><br />It was straight up trash . At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack ( burlap ) of FAIL ! The fighting is barely martial , the acting is teetering on the edge of par , and the music is not worth describing . There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made . The decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak , and did nothing but frustrate me . I think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using Yumiko Shaku .
0 In the recent movement to bring Asian films over to America , this is THE LAST movie that should be released here . Being a big fan of asian movies from all genres , I was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re - released into the US market so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store.<br /><br />Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing , Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this movie out of the water . Jet Li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences . If you 're looking for martial arts entertainment , your time would be better off with a Jackie Chan flick!!!<br /><br />Moreover ... you think you 're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death BUT SURPRISE ! ! ! A good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue , an absense of action , the lack of devloping a tangent plot , pretty much NOTHING to do with the premise we are exposed to . It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy , and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director dedicated no time in elbaorating , and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue . Would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect.<br /><br />Speaking of which , I really do n't believe the choreographer of Iron Monkey , did the action sequence in Princess Blade . I was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness . I just did n't buy it.<br /><br />Please ... I'm warning you to PLEASE do not waste your time / money with this movie . The premise is intrigueing , and the trailer might even tempt you but I am positive that this movie is NOT suited for the public ( maybe in Japan but not in the states ) and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the Asian film industry .
0 I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie . < br /><br />I just got done sitting through this movie , and the only thing that impressed me , was that I somehow had the will power to not stop it.<br /><br />I've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not , but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I 've ever seen in a movie . Most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent is n't doing the same . I 've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots.<br /><br />So now we have a " futuristic " action movie with poor action , and virtually no sign of the future . < br /><br />Most of the movie does n't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmboy / terrorist and his disturbed sister . The movie has multiple plot lines , and none of them really pan out to be worth anything . < br /><br />Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub , which was quite bad . The entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on . But I got the general idea . ( Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes)<br /><br />If you 've heard about this being a futuristic action / ninja flick , then you 've heard wrong . That s what I thought it was when I heard about it , and now I 've lost 90 minutes of my life . Do n't let this happen to you . Steer well clear of it .
0 Judging by some of the comments in IMDB , I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one , but essentially an action movie.<br /><br />Whatever it is that I watched , it certainly did n't feel like a movie . The story is simple and straightforward ( even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated ) . Take three interest groups : 1 ) the government 2 ) the rebels 3 ) a group of assassins.<br /><br />Now subtract the first ( they never appear in the movie ) . Then simply let one of the assassins , the princess , become a rogue on a revenge trip . Add in a rebel love - interest with a guilty conscience . And you 've got the ingredients.<br /><br />But they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie . Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci - Fi on a low budget , what you 're left with is a feeling of emptiness . The movie just does not feel like a movie , but a weird , incoherent , boring dream.<br /><br />Avoid.<br /><br />2/10
0 I 've seen the movie only recently , although it appeared in 2001 . I hoped to see an entertaining movie , but let me tell you , Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi . The " princess " is not very talkative , as you may have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme , who only stared to make his point , then beat the crap out of the opponents . During the entire movie , I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked , why was she fighting , who did she love and trust . I waited in vain . Crappy movie . Crappy dialog . Do n't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds ! It 's so bad , that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour . Approximately . I give a 4/10 .
0 If you 've read the original novel , as I did , you will probably hate this thing.<br /><br />The film version of _ Absolute Beginners _ is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms attempting to create a " period piece " set in the late 1950s and failing to re - create or even pay homage to that period -- the US monstrosity of _ Dirty Dancing _ does similar to 1963 , except that film proved financially successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing . In addition to suffering from " looking too 1980s " , the characters have been changed , re - arranged , and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and , of course , their names : Suze is transformed from the narrator 's flighty ex - girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money ( at her own admittance in the first few pages ) into a hapless and naive " Eve "- archetype seduced by fame and glamour , exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss , who surprisingly was n't given a Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle . She and the narrator , re - named " Colin " ( after the book 's author , Colin MacInnes ) for the film , are also in a relationship.<br /><br />Big Jill 's character , a lesbian seemingly butch yet " fop like " in her mid-20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble - headed lesbians , and one of the narrator 's closest friends , dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator , is reduced to a sort of " named extra " with only a few throw - away lines , and tonnes of comical outfits.<br /><br />The Fabulous Hoplite , a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel , is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film , camped - up and all but ignored.<br /><br />The narrator 's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film , he 's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood , and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator 's mum seems , for all practical purposes , ignored.<br /><br />In its favour , the music ( for what it is ) is well - composed , and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book ( " ... some days , they 'll write musicals about the 1950s ... " ) as their inspiration to write a musical , but in the world of bad camped - up musicals , this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch . Unlike _ Shock Treatment _ or _ Starstruck _ crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts . Unlike _ The Apple _ , there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue.<br /><br />You really ca n't blame it 's " too 1980s " feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s . The film version of _ Annie _ released in 1981 , pays a wonderfully well - executed tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s , and _ Napolean Dynamite _ manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 ( though it 's not explicitly set in the 1980s , those who lived through the decade can not deny that the film " feels very 1980s " ) . Obviously , it was _ possible _ to make something good out of this , especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK , but it fails most apparently in the look and feel , and also in its treatment of the source material , which is downright disrespectful.<br /><br />Perhaps if you have n't read and have no intentions of reading the novel , you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late-1950s Soho London 's modernist jazz set . I can definitely see what the writing team were attempting , but they definitely could have done better . With Boy George as a household name and mixed - race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 UK , they definitely did _ not _ need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing . In fact , I 'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly -- it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teen - aged audience like two - bit idiots to make a quick buck off of .
0 The film is based on a genuine 1950s novel.<br /><br />Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three " London novels " : " Absolute Beginners " , " City of Spades " and " Mr Love and Justice " . I have read all three . The first two are excellent . The last , perhaps an experiment that did not come off . But McInnes 's work is highly acclaimed ; and rightly so . This musical is the novelist 's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one 's mind being turned into a glitzy , badly - acted , soporific one - dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s London , and does nothing of the sort.<br /><br />Thank goodness Colin McInnes was n't alive to witness it .
0 This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it . It 's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next . I rented this movie because I 'm a David Bowie fan , and I really appreciate musicals . In finality , Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired . The moral of the story was really befuddling . I could n't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out . For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the " no selling out " message . When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up . Maybe I rented half of two different movies ? Nope , there was a " Keep Britain White " song and dance sequence . I 'm sorry , but WWII is not something you can write a musical about . At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as " campy " as I have several times in this review . Overall I 'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors . ( And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit ! ) My grade : C-
0 " Absolute Beginners " was a film for the younger generation , a multi - time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in Britain and how these troubled , constantly hitting each note , teen 's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow . It could have been dubbed the " Moulin Rouge " of the 80s , but it disappeared . It made its very shallow mark on the world , snuck under the radar , and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section , the comedy section , or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that does n't need chain money to survive . Alas , that was n't where I found it  but I found it , watched it , tried my hardest to sing along with it , stared into Bowie 's eyes , but found myself faded by the end . Did it not survive the test of time ? Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society ? Is Bowie too creepy ? I think " Absolute Beginners " falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang , but withers to a mere sparkle by the end.<br /><br />"Absolute Beginners " opens with a huge number that takes us through the non - gritty streets of London which involve theft nightly , prostitutes on every corner , dance throughout , booze like rivers , and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual . Sounds like a place we would all hate to be   right ? Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters . The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie O'Connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl , Suzette ( played by Patsy Kensit ) . These two have chemistry , and while Suzette looks like a pre - rehab Lohan , to me they worked . There was a huge spark between them , the chemistry was like lava , and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled . I was ready  but then , something happened . Temple takes us out of the nightlife , takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning , and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first . Suzette runs away , Colin becomes a pervert , and Bowie   well   I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  I can tell you that much . Temple gives us this flashy city , this opportunity to see those that inhabit it , but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger . We learn about Colin , mainly , but nobody else . I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom , and what importance fashion had to that era . Also , were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s , but maybe it was my TV.<br /><br />Character development thrown right out the door , Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger , more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about . One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example . Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colin 's parents ( of which I did n't know it was them until after the film ) and a song which screams apathy . Great song , too many characters , not enough time , suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency , and it just falls apart in your hands . Then , if that was n't enough , we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs , rubbing our noggin ' trying to understand where our characters are or are going , and Temple throws in hatred , anger , and politics into the final act . While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme , I did n't think racism would be on the top of the bill . Suddenly , friends are missing , people are angry , and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race ? Somebody help me out here . It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off . To me , the ending of " Absolute Beginners " was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number . That first part set the pace , and Temple could not keep up.<br /><br />Overall , I must say that Temple can direct a music video , but I do n't think he was quite prepared for the feature film . I do n't think this film will ever make it into full " cult " status , and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come . It is a fun film to watch initially , but when we get to that final part , it just explodes from the inside . I wanted some cutting edge work , but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for . I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s , but by the end it just felt forced . I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to " Motivation " by the ever - freaky Bowie in this film , it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status . I am glad that I watched this film once , but that is all that my small brain can take . I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning , but he could n't control his characters ( way too many ) , and the songs did n't seem to match the final moments of the film . It came out of nowhere , and it was unwelcomed . If this was a film about racism , it needed to be from the beginning . " Absolute Beginners " was a welcomed adventure , but I do n't think I will be dusting this film off in the future.<br /><br />Grade : * * out of * * * * *
0 Recreation of 1950 's ( London ) Soho and the up - and - coming people . Based on a cult novel.<br /><br />Julian Temple is a video director . No more , no less . Give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video . Here he forgets that two minutes with people that ca n't really act is one thing - but two hours ? What was he thinking of . Besides who are the audience ? Who cares about a book that was well remembered way - back - when . The usual London story of the chancer taking his chance . < br /><br />What could really drag this film even further down ? Oh I know , third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot . David Bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight . The soundtrack album is clay pigeon material.<br /><br />There is one good thing though . Good recreation of period Soho . Shame they could n't think of anything to put in front of it .
0 Following the disasterous Revolution , this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and thus the British Film Industry . The film is absolute pants , it 's full of music from the attempted mid-80 's jazz revival and based on a book & author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity . Temple searched for ages trying to find Suzette and came up with 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time . By the time the film came out of post production the Jazz revival was over , as was Kensett 's career and the film met a totally uncaring film public.<br /><br />Mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst / campest / cheesiest acting to ever grace the British silver screen watching it almost 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy .
0 I remember watching this film back in 86 ' when it first came out & what an awful film . The acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind . I think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion & i was not tired that i remember . Please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining . It 's just a pity i could n't give it a zero or a negative score . I wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor . If i remember right i sat & watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with & the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake that s how bad this film was .
0 An uptight voyeur who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad - seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they 're off to discover America . Get the idea ? There 's not an original moment in this whole movie .
0 " Proximity " tells of a convict ( Lowe ) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him . This very ordinary film is an action / drama with a weak plot ; stereotypical , poorly developed characters ; and a one dimensional performance by Lowe . A forgettable film not worthy of further commentary .
0 This thrown together piece of fecal matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it 's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity . Too bad as the premise is promising ( as it so often is in Duhllywood ) , but in the hands of this scriptwriter it segues off into la la land . < br /><br />Lowe is in Prison serving time for a DUI that killed off his mistress . We get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real BAD about this . Then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself . Or does he ? Lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly . His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about . So why do they then set him up to be killed ? Ah , that 's where this story could get interesting . That 's where it falls off the rails , and once off the rails it decides it can get away with insulting the viewers attention for the next numbing hour.<br /><br />****************SPOILERS****************************<br /><br />I wo n't bore with an endless recounting of the irrationality of what follows , but contemplate this ending . Lowe has been trapped by the bad guys on a train . They want a tape he has , because that tape will screw their boss , and them . So on to the train come 3 cops , guns drawn , ready to rescue Lowe . The bad guys kill the cops , in front of half the passengers and then .... continue chasing Lowe to get the tape . HELLO ! ! ! ! killing 3 cops in public will get you into deep doodo , to hell with the tape . Yet off they go through a mall shooting up the place , as if the public did not exist as witnesses , and in the end Lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the tape ! ! !
0 That is the only thing I can positive to say about this movie . Cleveland is the star , I 've been there and never saw the city look this good . Beautiful river and cityscapes.<br /><br />This movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you wo n't notice the lack of real world relevance . People running around and shooting guns without any consequence . For example , there is a shoot out at Rob Lowe 's character 's house- two cars are stolen , and yet the cops do n't show up there till much later in the movie . Murder for hire never looked so implausible.<br /><br />Whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets . Many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this . I check the date of the movie just to make sure it was n't written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case . This movie is currently in rotation on Universal 's HD channel- unless you want to drool of over Lowe there is no reason to watch it .
0 Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ , but PROXIMITY isn`t that kind of film , it`s more like a " Man on the run " film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
0 Here 's a horror version of PRISCILLA : QUEEN OF THE DESERT ( they wish ! ) starring Melinda / Mindy ( RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3 ) Clarke as Candy , a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny ( Jason Durr ) . He ends up in a South - of - the - border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw ( an overacting Robert Englund in a toupee ) . She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they 're transformed by a newly fallen meteor . The dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen " bitches " and Candy develops a VERY long , talking , killing forked tongue she ca n't control . Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications.<br /><br />First off , Clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie . You watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes , very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises , including an eye - popping , skin tight latex bodysuit ... and wonder how come this actress is n't a huge star . It 's too bad the rest of this cult attempt does n't live up to her promise.<br /><br />Blame director / scripter Sciamma , who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs ... but his vulgar gags , annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor . Another nail in the coffin ; the film looks cheap , lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales . Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in his film , because she alone keeps you watching .
0 Can A - Pix ever , ever , ever do anything right ? This movie was meant to be seen on TV in a letterbox format . Since A - Pix does n't even believe in pan and scan , we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side . Of course , not that you are missing much . This movie is incredibly bad . It 's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80 % of the movie for no reason .
0 Impenetrable rubbish . This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . The dialogue is ghastly , the horror effects are laughable . The only thing that kept me watching was the ever - splendid and totally underrated Michael Cule .
0 Really bad movie . Maybe the worst I 've ever seen . Alien invasion , a la The Blob , without the acting . Meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue . Bad plot , bad fake tongue . Absurd comedy worth missing . Wash your hair or take out the trash .
0 first of all let 's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for having to be associated with this piece of drivel . i had to give this a 1 it would n't let me give it a zero . wanna know how bad this movie is ? my mom calls me from across town and tells me " son , i just watched the stupidest movie ever . i responded as saying " the killer tongue huh ? " she was like how did you know that ? that 's how bad this movie is . i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda . okay i 'll give it a chance . i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies . i implore you , do n't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap . run away . far away . if you see it on the shelf at Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store , turn it around and walk away .... and i still want my two hours back dang it
0 This has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies I have ever seen in my entire life . Just when I think I have seen the stupidest scene in history , along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene . I think the transvestite poodles did it for me , or better yet , her talking tongue ... or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat . Decisions , decisions ...
0 Not totally off the wall in a good way , but just totally stupid . " Killer Tongue " is an uneasy mixture of sci - fi , horror , and supposed comedy . What this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film . There is very little dialog , mainly due to the fact that the script , if there was one , is complete " pond scum " . I would n't even call it strange , more like just " total nonsense " . This movie is certain to disappoint , and you have been warned . There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this , and if you do , the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish ............................................................... MERK
0 One of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through , Killer Tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of The Rocky Horror Picture Show , Brain Damage , and Pulp Fiction . Designed primarily to offend , apparently , but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it .
