1 Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film . After seeing it for the first time I 'm glad to say that it does n't disappoint . On the contrary , you get your time 's worth , which means ( as to what Miyazaki 's films are concern ) , that is nothing less than excellent ! < br /><br />Produced early in his cinematic career , Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies , with strong ( but young ) female characters , forced to grow up due to external circumstances , helped out by very interesting ( and some times lovable ) supporting characters . And , of course , the usual battle of nature versus civilization , flying machines ( lots of it ! ! ) , beautiful painted sceneries   but alas , no pigs ( at least that i 've noticed , after all I have only seen it once ) . Never the less , Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier , with Nausicãa , which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke , his magnum opus . Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two , with a soft action packed first 30 minutes , resembling his TV series Conan , and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes . In here we are introduced to Sheeta , a girl who literally falls from the sky , only to be found by Pazu , a young boy working in a little countryside mining town . Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa , Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from , whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates . As the movie progresses , the plot gets heavier and much more interesting , revealing Myiazaki at his best . < br /><br />The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away , ( or vice versa , as Castle in the sky was produced first ) , and much like its director , Joe Hisaishi _ the composer _ starts with a very light score , that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward ! < br /><br />A note to the English dubbing , with a good interpretation from the two lead stars , although Anna Paquin 's Sheeta has a very thick accent ( which the actress still had at that point in her career ) , and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska , making up for a delighting yet devilish villain ! < br /><br />Don't miss this one people !
1 I just realised I 've been using IMDb for years now and I 've never reviewed my favourite film . By favourite I do n't mean something I like for now , I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it . This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again ; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties . I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at , I 'm also male , the gender that this film is intended for ( the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki 's protagonists are female ) . Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek ( sp ? ) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I 've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good ( the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors ) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD ! It 's not available on any distribution in an English - speaking country . Go figure.<br /><br />There are hundreds of competent reviews so I 'm going to put some trivia here , not that I 'm the definitive archive of information for this film.<br /><br />First up I 'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki 's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.<br /><br />The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag 's Ravine ( Pazu 's town area ) on the Welsh mining communities . He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s ( might be late 70s ) just after one of the great mining strikes . Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight . The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man . The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.<br /><br />The island is of course from Swift 's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift 's book is , deliberately , ridiculous . In Castle in The Sky , Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I 'm not sure , someone told me that.<br /><br />Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki 's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel ' The Incredible Tide ' by Alexander key ( novel is available online ) . Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa 's Pazu and Shita . In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation . He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds I 've ever seen too . Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata 's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun ( 1968 ) - amazing by today 's standards in fact . What else ... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they 're pretty rare.<br /><br />This film is such a gift , I do n't know what we 'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around , this is like an oasis . Arigatou Miyazaki - sensei !
1 This is the best dub I 've ever heard by Disney , as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack , themes , characters , dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service . Urrrghhh < br /><br />This one has different atmosphere , especially the deviation from the common heroine . This one has both hero and heroine ( although I do n't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here , since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme ) . As usual , after being introduced by Spirited away , amazed by Mononoke , troubled by Grave of Fireflies , and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part . Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi 's dud . Well , in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart , I ended up giving 10 rating . I 'd give 9.8 rating , but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie.<br /><br />SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie , people die in this one , the lonely robot , the abandoned place , and it ends with destruction . It is as if mankind really ca n't live with too much power . The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending . It 's just sad somehow . The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well ( as always ) . Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu , Kanno , Williams caliber . People who can brings a movie , a game , an event to life , even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition.<br /><br />This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days ( It 's a Wonderful Life etc etc ) . Well , things change ....
1 It is an almost ideal romantic anime ! MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES ! But the English dubbed version is not too good . Perhaps the 1999 version will be better .
1 The first of the official Ghibli films , Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa , but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic , this is more of an action comedy - adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.<br /><br />For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it . Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki 's attention to detail , and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous , beautiful perfection . The animation , though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films , is a little better than in Nausicaa.<br /><br />I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more ' Lupinesque ' anime style . Here there are a whole bunch of them : the pirates . They provide the comic element in the film , though quite why it needs a comic element I 'm not sure . There was nothing funny about Nausicaa , and I think it was better off for it . Still . having said that , Dola , the pirate leader , is easily the most memorable character in the film ( even if she 's basically a female Long John Silver . Do n't be surprised if you 're reminded of ' Treasure Planet ' at times ) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.<br /><br />The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part , actually . However something started going pear - shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark . I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story . I 'll come back to that later.<br /><br />There is so much to admire about Laputa , and so many people obviously love it , that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10 , but for me the operative word here is ' admire ' . It was more impressive than personally affecting , and at over two hours it just started to drag.<br /><br />The crucial thing for me was this : I really found that I did n't care much about any of the characters . Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters , make you really fall for them , rather than leave them as relatively two - dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie . Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it , but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals . That 's where Laputa falls down as far as I 'm concerned , and that 's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie . Having said that , it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986 , when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire ' Great Mouse Detective'.<br /><br />Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film , and you should definitely see it , but I do feel it 's over - rated . I definitely prefer the earlier ' Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.<br /><br />BTW , if you manage to watch them in chronological order , watch for the fox - squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa .
1 Retitled from its original Japanese name of LAPUTA ( for being an offensive phrase , something which director Hayao Miyazaki was oblivious to at the time ) , CASTLE IN THE SKY is the master animator 's third film , and it 's one of his most beloved of all time . Initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release , it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world . Inspired by Jonathan Swift 's " Gulliver 's Travels " , CASTLE IN THE SKY is a steampunk - themed action adventure tale about two young orphans -- young miner Pazu , and mysterious girl Sheeta ( who wears a magic crystal around her neck ) -- who team up to find the long - lost island of Laputa , which is rumored to have great riches and gems . They are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty Dola ( who at first chase them , yet turn out to be true allies ) and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost - secret agent , Muska , who wants the power of Laputa for his own benefit.<br /><br />For anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours , this film is an excellent choice , featuring just the right amount of humor , exploration , wonder , and mystery to keep one interested . The artwork , although not as spectacular as in some of Miyazaki 's later movies , is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations , incredibly exciting action scenes , and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy . And while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than Miyazaki 's other works , each has a memorable , endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over . Dola , in particular , makes for a terrific comic character , shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of Sheeta the next . Muska is one of the few Miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain , but like Dola , he commands every scene he 's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly.<br /><br />Anime fans have often compared this movie to Gainax 's sci - fi adventure series NADIA : THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER . After all , both works share similar story and character elements ... not to mention that they were both created by Miyazaki himself . Where both differ is in their execution . NADIA , although charming for the most part , suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point , devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot , even though it did have a strong ending . CASTLE IN THE SKY , on the other hand , remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time , and is all the better for it . While the film 's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some " cartoonish " moments , like a brawl between Pazu 's boss and one of Dola 's sons , it 's never to the point that it detracts from the film.<br /><br />About eleven years ago , Disney released an English version featuring a cast of big - names such as James van der Beek , Anna Paquin , Cloris Leachman , Mark Hamill , Mandy Patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as Tress MacNeille and Jim Cummings . It also features an ambitious reworking of Joe Hisaishi 's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the Seattle Music Orchestra ( interestingly , the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself ) . As much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore , Miyazaki had no such problems ; in fact , he is said to have applauded the reworking , and for good reason , because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub . While there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original Japanese is a bit jarring ( notably the journey through a dragon - infested storm cloud ) , the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original , particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end . Here , Hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals . < br /><br />As far as the performances in the dub go , the leads are probably at the short end of the stick ; James Van Der Beek 's Pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character , while Anna Paquin 's Sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times ( a problem which actually works in favor of the character ) . That said , both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout . It 's the lively supporting cast , however , that really make this dub so much fun , particularly Cloris Leachman 's Dola and Mark Hamill 's Muska . Both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they 're in ; as with the rescore , these two really warrant a listen to the Disney dub . The script adaptation borders on the loose side at times -- there 's quite a bit of extra lines and/or commentary ( some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone)--but aside from at least one debatable alteration ( Sheeta 's speech in the climactic showdown " the world can not live without love " as opposed to the original " you ca n't survive apart from Mother Earth " ) , the overall characters , story , and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original . On the whole , there is little point comparing the Disney version to the original language track ; each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece , and I like them both . ( They 're also better than Streamline / JAL 's more literal but frightfully robotic , lifeless , abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980 's ; do n't believe anybody who says this version is " superior " to Disneys -- trust me , the opposite is true . ) < br /><br />Either way , though , you ca n't go wrong with CASTLE IN THE SKY . It 's one of Miyazaki 's all - time greatest , and I highly recommend it .
1 Like many Americans , I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw " Spirited Away . " I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times . Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki . One of his earlier works is " Castle in the Sky . " Although it 's still enjoyable , it 's not as good as " Spirited Away " ( though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).<br /><br />A young boy named Pazu ( James Van Der Beek ) is working in a mine late one night , when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky . When she wakes up the next morning , she introduces herself as Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) . But Sheeta has a secret , and before he knows it , Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates , the army and a lost floating city.<br /><br />Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing : a sense of wonder and magic . Many filmmakers have tried , but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki . Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.<br /><br />Because the film is animated , dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words . It also helps that the translated dialogue is well - written and voiced by talented actors . The voice acting is varied . James Van Der Beek fares best . He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character . Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta . She 's frightened by the events going on around her , but she knows what she has to do . Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska . He 's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta , and will do anything to get it . The other voices are bad . Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola . Leachman may have won an Oscar for " The Last Picture Show , " but she 's annoying as the pirate leader . Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that 's nearly always monotonous . It 's so bad it nearly ruins the film ! Jim Cummings is an effective voice - over actor , but he 's miscast as the general.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend seeing " Castle in the Sky . " I 'll probably end up buying it myself . But even though it 's not as good as " Spirited Away , " it 's still pretty good .
1 Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week , where it was titled " Laputa : Castle in the sky " . I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that , which , as usual , was of very good quality.<br /><br />Just looked up " Laputa " on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected ... the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel " Gulliver 's travels " , which was published in the early to mid 1700s.<br /><br />Anyway , this is an engaging Japanese fairytale , which features an English speaking voice - cast . It 's suitable for young children , I think , but it does run at just over two hours in length , so it may be too long for some , though not for an adult like me.<br /><br />The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it . The children are not the only ones looking for this island . They have pirates , the army and spies looking for the island too , and looking to capture the children ( Sheeta , the girl , voiced by Anna Paquin , and Pazu , the boy , voiced by James Van Der Beek ) in order to help them find it.<br /><br />The graphics are magnificent ... sort of photo - realistic at times , especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch - light , or the pretty scenes of bright , sunny days , with white clouds , or mist.<br /><br />Recommended .
1 This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike . The animation is beautiful , the characters are rich and interesting , and the story is captivating ; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time . However , there is a couple of caveats to this statement . It 's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back - catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it . My main point being , Disney re - dubbed the film , despite the original English version being very impressive . The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers . The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix . It begs the question why did Disney make such changes ? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money , which is fair enough , but in the process they tainted they film . It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone . My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love . I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life !
1 The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad . My dad actually recorded it off the TV . I must have watched is over 20 times , before the relatively recent release on DVD.<br /><br />I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed . In the first version , which I still have on VHS , the mood of the film , thanks to the dialogue , was actually very dark . However the new version , featuring Van Der Beek et al , is more comic.<br /><br />To put it another way , it 's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub , before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese.<br /><br />I'm in no way complaining , the story and quality of animation are not detracted from , but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film .....
1 I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me . Laputa , whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences , has the cartoonish knack of the director 's debut production Conan . In fact , Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan -- who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet , then started running . This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch . The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa -- the only exception may be the robot . Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds , the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism . If it has a theme at all it 's anti - warfare . The importance of living naturally -- this is related with the flying castle , is dismissably shortly discussed , and not really followed through . Overall , I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel - good and corny .
1 This is quite an amazing film to watch . Using digital technology , the director , Rohmer , has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops . Most of the time this works brilliantly , especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life . It is less successful in a few scenes , where it limits camera angles ( they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example ) but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as History itself . It is narrated using the memoirs of the Duc d'Orleans ' ex- mistress , Grace Elliott . So , an event usually claimed as one of their own by Marxist historians , especially in France , is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner . Inevitably a different point of view emerges -there can be no objective representation . The use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality . Personally , I found the story line around the King 's death the most interesting . A staunch Royalist she is shocked when the Duc votes for the King 's death ( a basic knowledge of the French Revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between Grace and the Duc here . He was Louis 's cousin and had himself elected to the Assembly , where he promptly changed his name to Philip Equality ) . The filming of Louis 's death is masterly . Grace and her maidservant are in Meudon , out of Paris , watching from a hill with a telescope . We do not see the execution , we only hear the maid 's commentary , like Grace . The most dramatic event of the Revolution happens off screen . Grace can not bear to watch her king be killed . Her view is that of an aristocrat . Any justification of Louis 's death is literally beyond her vision . This is powerful , keenly intelligent film making . The love story between the duc and Grace is insinuated , never told , and is powerfully moving ( tho the Duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times ; what does she see in him ? No accounting for taste ) . The undercurrents of madness ( simply existing being enough to be a suspect ) that sweep individuals along in a time such as the Revolution are illustrated as Grace 's life is turned upside down , her house is searched daily , yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself ! If you have any interest at all in a subtle , well told film , making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale , or the representation of a pivotal moment in Europe 's history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman , its ultimate outsider , then this is well worth your time . It is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded .
1 Eric Rohmer 's " The Lady and the Duke " . could have used a better translation for the title . " The English Woman and the Duke " , perhaps , would have been more accurate . While it 's obvious this film is not for everyone , judging by the comments to this forum , it is worth watching because in spite of the intricate pattern of the story , Mr. Rohmer has created a movie that could be seen as an art exhibit in a museum . The mixed technology used in the movie , ultimately , works well.<br /><br />The strange story of Grace Elliott , a noble lady who had been the mistress of the king of England and of the French Duc d'Orleans , holds our attention . The setting is Paris during the days that followed the French Revolution . The country was in turmoil and the power was in the hands of the people , who could n't care less for the aristocrats . The images show the agitators running around with heads of famous people right after their trip to the guillotine.<br /><br />Grace relation with the Duc had ended , but she remains a true friend to the great man that is in danger , himself , of losing his own head . Grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able of an escape . She even has an enemy in her own house , in the form of the cook , Pulcherie , who would not hesitate to denounce her at the least provocation.<br /><br />Watching the movie , at times , gives the viewer the impression one is going on a trip through the Louvre watching those huge canvases that depict this crucial era of the French history . Rather than finding the digitalization process distracting , we found it to enhance the film in many ways.<br /><br />Lucy Russell , as Grace Elliott , does a fine job to portray this woman who saw a lot during her lifetime . Her French seems to be excellent , as it appears she is fluent in it . As the Duc d'Orleans , Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution making us believe he is the nobleman himself without any effort . The supporting cast also was great . As an ensemble piece Mr. Rohmer gets good performances all around.<br /><br />For lovers of history , " The Lady and the Duke " will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to the vision of Eric Rohmer .
1 Anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies . This film is riveting and does n't have a boring moment . Why ? Because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis . I repeat -- intelligent dialogue ! That is what characterizes nearly all of Rohmer 's films , and that is why a lot of people do n't like them . They prefer action . Fine , let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films , while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this.<br /><br />Rohmer has always been accused of being " talky . " Well , he is , but to me that 's a compliment , not a criticism . Shakespeare was talky , too . Is there a talkier play than " Hamlet ? " Whenever the subject , or theme , of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values , there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values , an that is largely what this film is all about . Aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism ; loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path ; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life , even if the person possessing that life is not so nice , or even despicable . ( Anyone ever hear of Dostoyevsky , or " Crime and Punishment ? " ) These are what this film is all about.<br /><br />The two leads in this film are impeccable , as if they were born to play these roles . Lucy Russell , who is English and speaks French as her second language , is especially brilliant . Do yourself a favor and see this riveting film . It may be the last film by this screen Master .
1 Erich Rohmer 's " L'Anglaise et le duc " makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins ' " La Commune ( Paris 1871 ) . " Both films -screened at this year 's Toronto International Film Festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale . Ironic , given the tragic events that were taking place in the U.S. during the festival.<br /><br />Set in Paris during the French Revolution , the movie , based on Grace Elliott 's ( Lucy Russell ) " Memoirs , " is a first - hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days . She also details her relationship with The Duke of Orleans ( played by Jean - Claude Dreyfus ) , who , in contrast to herself , is a supporter of the Revolution.<br /><br />True to form , you do n't know whose side of history Rohmer is going to come down on . One of the earliest of the French " New Wave " filmmakers , Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative . After all , in the midst of the rebelling - youth - Viet - Nam days of the late 60s and 70s , he was filming romantic little confections like " Claire 's Knee . " But do n't sell the old boy short , folks , he 's always been a student of human nature , not an ideologue , and " L'Anglaise et le duc " continues to bear this out.<br /><br />Rohmer 's characters are never the " bad guys " nor the " good guys ' ; they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities -and limitations . That 's why his movies are always provocative , and this film is no exception.<br /><br />Now for the technological nuts and bolts.<br /><br />Rohmer , though making his way into his 80s , is still on the cutting - edge of cinematic innovation . The look of " L'Anglaise " is like something you 've never seen before . You guessed it , the old guy -like several of the festival 's directors this year- has gone digital.<br /><br />All of the movie 's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s Parisian settings . As a matter of fact , you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film 's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film 's psychological -and yes , I 'll say it- political insights.<br /><br />Toronto features some of the world 's edgiest young filmmakers this year , as well as some of the world 's oldest . And the old masters are standing there on cinema 's cutting - edges right alongside the young ones.<br /><br />Long live youth . Long live old age . And long live Erich Rohmer.<br /><br / >
1 Rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution . What 's more attractive about " La Anglaise ... " ( apart from the story itself ) is the fabulous aesthetics that Rohmer has achieved . The images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures . In some moments you ca n't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in Louvre Musseum . Every shot is like a piece of art.<br /><br />*My rate : 7.5/10<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />-------------- -<br /><br />------------<br /><br />-------------------
1 I was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'Anglaise , in this beautifully acted , intellectually and visually compelling film . Thank you so much , Monsieur le directeur Rohmer .
1 Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot , an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution . One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative , but who knew he was such a red - blooded reactionary . If you can put aside Rohmer 's unabashed defense of the monarchy ( and that is not an easy thing to do , given that , for instance , the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts ) , this is actually an elegant , intelligent and polished movie . Lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century France , Rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards . It is a blatantly artificial conceit , but it somehow works . And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that should n't be .
1 I am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie . I saw it at an independent film festival , so do n't expect it to come to your town anytime soon . During the film , i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out . Too bad for them ( down here in the south , folks do n't like having to read subtitles ) . The movie starts out slow , but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored . When the action finally arrives , i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster.<br /><br />I also got a big kick of the Chapter Titles appearing before the chapters , especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen . It reminded me of Zelda ( Ocarina of Time ) when you face level bosses.<br /><br />If this is the future of " video game / comic book " movies , then i welcome it .
1 I found this movie to be very well - paced . The premise is quite imaginative , and as a viewer I was pulled along as the characters developed . The pacing is done very well for those that like to think -- enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on , and questions keep arising which are later answered , producing a well - thought out and very satisfying film , both cerebrally and from an action standpoint.<br /><br />It seems some people were looking for a non - stop roller - coaster ride with this film -- one of those that comes charging out of the gate . This would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill -- creating a wonderful sense of anticipation -- and is ultimately , in my mind , more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid.<br /><br />Excellent film .
1 Alive < br /><br />Alive is a very entertaining SCI - FI movie from Japan . I have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved Versus this director 's debut film or his third film Azumi . I have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies . Frankly I went to the video store to get Versus but I am just fine with Alive.<br /><br />If you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then Alive is not your pick . There is plenty of action however it comes as pay - off for a whole hour of character driven build - up . Personally I think it is well done and worth it.<br /><br />Of course some of the plot is silly as with many SCI - Fi action films and I think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect . This film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply.<br /><br />They kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building(taking a cue from the cube ) but the film does n't suffer for it . Another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many Flashbacks and dream sequences . < br /><br />Rent this !
1 The movie starts out with a bunch of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in individual cells , waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair.<br /><br / > Then our " hero " , who is called Tenshu , is taken to the chair , he 's zapped , and then .... he 's still " Alive " . AHA ! He is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : Either we zap you until we 've made sure you 're actually dead OR you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you " . Our hero says yes to option 2 , and then the actual story commences.<br /><br / > He wakes up in a different sort of cell ( very high - tech and very big ) , where he finds another cell - mate , who also managed to survive the electric boogie - ride . A voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish , as long as it happens within that room . Sounds a little suspicious , but the two men accept : What else can they do ? < br /><br / > What these two men do not know is that they have been set together , so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them . Basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other . Sounds weird ? Indeed , but there 's a greater purpose to all of this . THIS is the part which should not be revealed , and so it shall remain unrevealed.<br /><br / > But fear not , it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo - action movie , fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : How long time can you stand being with a man who 's an S.O.B. and would you kill him to obtain freedom ? < br /><br / > The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest , it sneaks up without you actually knowing it . Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with WILD Matrix - like action fight - scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon.<br /><br / > The movie is indeed very special , so special that normal cinemas wo n't view it under normal circumstances . However , the story is fascinating , the music is fantastic , and the actors do their bit ( some more than others ) to make the movie truly unique.<br /><br / > If you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it , watch it , and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash.<br /><br / >
1 Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death . When he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments . He chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution . They can have whatever the want in the room ( within reason ) , but they ca n't leave . after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100 . After some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they ca n't sleep . One day a ' witch ' come into their cell ( albeit a glassed off portion ) What happens next I 'll let you find out . I may be in the minority here but I liked the build up , it was intriguing to me . Now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was I would have rated this so much higher.<br /><br />My Grade : C+ < br /><br />Media Blaster 's 2 DVD set Extras : Disc 1 ) Director 's Cut ; Trailers for " Versus " , " Aragami " , " Attack the Gas Station " , and " Deadly Outlaw Rekka " Disc 2 ) Theatrical Cut ; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki , Ryuhei Kitamura , Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi ; Cast and crew interview ; Making of ; Original Trailer ; and Promo Teasers
1 An inventive , suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia . A Japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms . Not completely successful , but taut , surprising and well - acted . One might find the film somewhat reminiscent of SAW  two men trapped in room and pitting against each other  but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film . It 's like watching a lab experiment . Some might find the contained suspense tedious , but this reviewer found it enthralling . The sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized . This is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system . Just right for a late night movie fest , when one is in the paranoid mood . It certainly kept me awake that night .
1 Most complaints I 've heard of this film really come down to one thing : It is n't Versus . Yes , the cast and crew is basically the same . Yes , Kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film 's second half , but that 's about where the similarities end . Versus takes place essentially all outside , showcasing Kitamura 's ability to craft an interesting B - movie in natural locations . For Alive , almost everything takes place inside . In small , cramped spaces . Here the art design is thrust into your face , and WHAT art design it is ! We are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces , and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces . Also a key difference is that we do n't get much action here until the end of the film . Versus was all about action and cool , here a LOT more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind . Because of this , Alive is a far more interesting film than Versus . You may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed , but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters.<br /><br />I'm now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay . You should too ! But be sure to realize this is a different animal from Versus - it 's often slow , and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it . I hope Media Blasters picks it up for subtitled R1 DVD release !
1 This may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially uncapturable world of the American college experience of the late 60s - early 70s . Go ahead , name another movie that even approaches this one : " Getting Straight " ? " RPM " ? These are caricatures . " Return of the Secaucus Seven " has its moments , but that 's a retrospective film about ( self - obsessed ) individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted * in * that time and place . " Drive , He Said " portrays-- with subtlety and nuance where it should , and a swift kick in the shorts where that 's the only appropriate way-- the anti - draft movement , the ambiguity of big - time college sports ( especially when there 's a war on ) , the sexual revolution of the period , and the general unreality of the day . Believe me , it was like that.<br /><br />The whole cast deserves commendation ( as does the director , of course ) but particular praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern , as the basketball coach , and Karen Black , the hero 's very unusual-- except for that time-- love interest . William Tepper , as the lead , also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student - athlete of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film ( remember Anthony Perkins in " Tall Story " ? Yikes!).<br /><br />All in all , a classic of a kind-- and the last film someone currently in 6th grade should be writing comments on ( " boring " , " repellent"-- um , right , sonny , please go back to your Arnold movies ) . Why is n't this film available from imdb ?
1 As Jack Nicholson 's directorial debut , Drive , He Said displays at the least that he is a gifted director of actors . Even when the story might seem to lose its way to the audience ( and to a modern audience - if they can find it , which pops up now and again on eBay - it might seem more free formed than they think ) , the film contains vivid , interesting characterizations . The film tells of two college kids : the protagonist is Hector ( William Tepper , in what borders on a break - out performance ) , a star of the Leopards , the college basketball team he plays on . While he has to deal with a coach ( Bruce Dern ) who puts on the pressure to stay focused , and a on and off girlfriend ( Karen Black ) with her own emotional problems , there 's Gabriel ( Michael Margotta ) , the other kid . Gabriel , it seems , is just a little more than freaked out by the possibility to be drafted , and so in his own radical mind - state he does what he can to keep out . But as Hector tries to find the balance between his oncoming fame and those he loves , Gabriel is going over the threshold of sanity.<br /><br />Nicholson , on the technical side of things , displays a fascinating editing style that keeps things on edge during the basketball scenes , and implements darkness in many other scenes with a documentary - feel throughout . And from Tepper , Black , and even Robert Towne ( writer of Chinatown , Last Detail , and Mission : Impossible among others , who rarely acts ) he garners some credible acting work . Though in Tepper there is a tendency to downplay his emotions . In some scenes , for example , when he could act brilliantly sarcastic , he does n't play it for what it 's worth . From Margotta , on the other hand , there is a vibrant , twisted force in his performance , and as he descends it 's frightening , but perhaps understandable from the times ( and what a climax ) . Dern steals most of his scenes , by the way , in a performance that should have garnered him an Oscar nomination . Every line of his dialog is appropriate , true , and it 's never hammed up like in recent coach movie performances . < br /><br />But what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters are n't explained to the degree one might wish more . The film was based on a novel by Jeremy Larner , who co - wrote the script with Nicholson , and I was expecting that the film to be longer than it was . It 's a slim volume with a lot of information , about the times , about the sport , about the underlying feelings that were with those of the younger generation . Nicholson presents us with these characters and situations , and rarely are they shown to what 's motivating them ( the anti - war protesters not included , their part 's understandable enough ) . Gabriel is perturbed by what 's going on in Vietnam , but what else is there ? Hector , too , is a guy who has apprehensions about being drafted for the NBA , and he still loves to play , but what 's holding him back ? This whole atmosphere is intriguing , how the late 60 's college / basketball experience was , but that intriguing quality , which does lead to some unconventionality , is kept at a point where it ca n't go too further . Overall , the effect of the film as a whole is bittersweet , and somewhat memorable for its good points , and not for it 's low ones . And , for sure , you can tell who 's behind the lens every step of the way . B+
1 Good luck finding this film to even watch - it 's not yet released on tape or DVD . I saw on release in the early ' 70 's , was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheque 's preservation efforts , and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years.<br /><br />No reason to repeat rwint 's accurate comments here . As a come - out Director soon after the soaring success of Five Easy Pieces , Jack N has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible , and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re - cutting . But it 's also a memorable icon for it 's time : the all very intense clashes of late 60 's college sports , student movements , sexual revolution , and more . < br /><br />Why see this film ? It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes : the frisky male bonding in the after - game showers ; Karen Black 's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it 's the first use of a word I had n't witnessed in film before ; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall . There are probably others I 'm omitting.<br /><br />Look for a nice surprise of a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films ; a thin David Ogend Stiers ; Mike Warren fresh out of his powder - blue UCLA uniform and readying for a dark - blue TV uniform ; Robert Towne - Actor ; and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves.<br /><br />Now : any connection between Harry Gittes last name , Robert Towne , and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes?<br /><br />It gets a " 7 " based on Karen Black . You 'll see why .
1 In a word ... amazing.<br /><br />I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan . I was so totally wrong . Pinjar is a heart - wrenching , emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws . I was haunted by it after watching it . It lingered on my mind for so long ; the themes , the pain , the loss , the emotion- all was so real.<br /><br />This is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays . It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story . Here , no one country is depicted as good or bad . There are evil Indians , evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis . The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious , meaningful ( thanks to Gulzar sahib ) and haunting . Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the acting just took my breath away . All were perfectly cast.<br /><br />If you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie ... look no further . This movie gives it all . I recommend it with all my heart . AMAZING can not describe how excellent it is .
1 Pinjar is a genuinely good film , with great acting , good narrative , good presentation , touching emotions , etc.<br /><br />It seems to me that the quality of films that Bollywood is producing is quite improving these days , and this film is one evidence.<br /><br />No Bollywood movie that I can remember of made such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human.<br /><br />The film rests on the great acting of Urmilla Matondkar , and also some from Manoj Bajpai . Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the partition , and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face . < br /><br />A must - see film . A technically superior Bollywood product , which I feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world .
1 Many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that Pinjar is unlike the run of the mill films produced in Bollywood . While this is true , Bollywood films in general are geared to a specific audience and should be appreciated for accomplishing their aims in this regard.<br /><br />However , Pinjar is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal equation based Bollywood film . Set during the time of Partition between India and Pakistan , Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time . Paro , the protagonist , is forced to choose between a life with a man who has abducted her and the fleeting hope of a life with her family back in Indian ruled Punjab . More than an issue of Hindus and Muslims , Pinjar addresses and defines a woman 's role as a daughter , as a wife , and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947 . Unlike typical Bollywood films which are escapist in nature , Pinjar is a film that makes its audience contemplate these issues during and after the film .
1 Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard . Set in Partition India , this film Shows the true reality of partition India . Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go . Her freedom , personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute . Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor . There several moments in the film where one is brought to tears . The film at points is deeply traumatic . Some of the partition scenes are spine chilling , yet Urmila 's endurance and survival are both remarkable . From a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations . A remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling .
1 I have been a Hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie , especially as a Hindi film . In the past several years , I had stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics ( Teesri Kasam , Mere Huzoor , Madhumati , Mother India , Sholay , etc . ) But this movie changed everything . It is one of the best movies I have ever seen . I found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America . It helped me to understand my own family history , which was always something very abstract to me . But , to " see " it , feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that Indian people endured . The film helped to put many things into perspective for me , especially considering the current world events . I never thought that a movie could change the way I think like this before ... it did . The plot is fantastic , the acting superb and the direction is flawless . Two thumbs up !
1 This movie was absolutely wonderful . The pre - partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully . Urmila has given yet another brilliant performance . What I truly admire about this movie is that it does n't resort to Pakistan - bashing that is running rampant in movies like Gadar and LOC . With the partition as a backdrop , the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong . The movie always centers around the tragic story of Urmila 's life . Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been depicted excellently . The movie actually shows how the people , both Hindus and Muslims , have suffered from this partition . The theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film .
1 I do n't have words to describe how good this movie is . Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition . The movie kept haunting me for many days.<br /><br />Urmila did the role of her life in this movie . She put life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in his role as Rashid . It is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of Puroo and Rashid . The Punjabi costumes looked so natural on Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan.<br /><br />Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did fabulous job . Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki.<br /><br />Some of the scenes you just ca n't get out of your mind . When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time , it brings tears to your eyes . The climax is just killer . I was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully , the ending was wonderful.<br /><br />This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah , Mughal - e - Azam , Banaras etc . Not to be missed .
1 I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here . I 'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US . So I do n't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films . Luckily , no comparison is needed.<br /><br />Pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece.<br /><br />In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time . On a mass - appeal scale , it * could * have been the Indian equivalent of " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon " had it been adequately promoted in the US . This could very well have been the film that put Bollywood on the American map . The American movie - going public has a long - standing love affair with " Gone With the Wind " , and while Pinjar does n't borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities . Not the least of which is the whopping ( by US standards ) 183-minute run time.<br /><br />Set against the gritty backdrop of the India - Pakistan partition in 1947 - 48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating . Put into an untenable position , she somehow manages to not only survive , but to grow -- and even flourish.<br /><br />If the story is lacking in any way , it 's in the exposition . Puro 's ( the protagonist ) growth as a person would be better illustrated -- at least for western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture -- if her character 's " back story " were more fully developed in the early part of the film . But that would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or perhaps even more . Because not one minute of the film is wasted , and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time . Better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains.<br /><br />I could use many words to describe Pinjar : " poignant " , " disturbing " , " compelling " , " heart - wrenching " come to mind immediately . But " uplifting " is perhaps as apropos as any of those . Any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such . And Puro 's triumph -- while possibly not immediately evident to those around her -- is no less than inspirational . For strength of story alone I can not recommend this film highly enough.<br /><br />Equally inspiring is Urmila Matondkar 's portrayal of Puro . All too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger , newer actresses , Urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays . She does n't merely act Puro 's part , she breathes life into the character . Manoj Bajpai 's selection as Rashid was inspired . He manages something far too few Indian film heroes can : subtlety . His command of expression and nuance is essential to the role . He brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword - wielding rioters combined.<br /><br />If you only see one Bollywood film in your life , make it Pinjar .
1 A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam . Urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best.<br /><br />there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through . It looked like bollywood finally gave away it 's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen.<br /><br />Content wise , the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one 's life goes beyond religion.<br /><br />The best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama.<br /><br />I simply loved it .
1 Pinjar is truly a masterpiece ... . It 's a thought provoking Film that makes you think and makes you question our culture . It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date . This film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and I believe would have been a serious contender at Cannes . All the characters were perfectly cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunting in their roles.<br /><br />The story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten.<br /><br />It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story . Here , no one country is depicted as good or bad . There are evil Indians , evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis . The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious , meaningful and haunting . Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the acting just took my breath away . All were perfectly cast .
1 Superb . I had initially thought that given Amrita Pritam 's communist leanings and Dr Dwivedi 's nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when I read the novel I was surprised to find that it was reverse.<br /><br />Kudos to marita Pritam for not being pseudo - sec and to Dr Dwivedi to be objective . This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way . Casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it . It is also a sad commentary on Hindu psyche as they ca n't stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the Hindu Brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor . On the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place . I think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they Will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt . will not be able to ask them to return the houses . This apart one has to salute the courage of characters of Puro and her Bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored . Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India.<br /><br />No wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women .
1 I was very fond of this film . It kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen . One of the better movies about the partition that I have seen . Urmila Matondkar is gorgeous too . This is one of the most personal and down - to - earth films I 've seen on the partition . It 's a little less mainstream than Gadar , and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on , and come out completely one the other side . This is n't typical bollywood fare , but rather an art - house type film . The best part of this movie is that it does n't dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another . It does n't blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things .
1 This is a extremely well - made film . The acting , script and camera - work are all first - rate . The music is good , too , though it is mostly early in the film , when things are still relatively cheery . There are no really superstars in the cast , though several faces will be familiar . The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch , because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented . It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other , and then cruelly separating them into two countries . There is some merit in this view , but it 's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition . It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen . But it is never painted as a black - and - white case . There is baseness and nobility on both sides , and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort , in the end , when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life , but also truly loved her , and her family which has disowned her , then later come looking for her . But by that point , she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults , and also that both can be dignified and caring people . The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching , since there can never be real reconciliation across the India / Pakistan border . In that sense , it is similar to " Mr & Mrs Iyer".<br /><br />In the end , we were glad to have seen the film , even though the resolution was heartbreaking . If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness , they would certainly be better off .
1 Another detailed work on the subject by Dr Dwivedi takes us back in time to pre - partioned Panjab . Dr Dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut . He has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life . The treatment of the subject is very delicate.<br /><br />Even though we have not been to the region during that time , the sets and costumes look real . Unlike most movies made on partition , this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience , but on its after - effects . The characters come to life . Priyanshu Chatterjee has given an impressive performance . Manoj Bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt - ridden man . The rest of the cast has done a good job too .
1 A complex story laid on the background of partition of Bharat . An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl , and an educated Hindu who burns the harvest of a Muslim man - yet in the end you end up liking them both . The story is powerful , yet the screenplay and flow are hesitant . Background music score and the songs are outstanding . Next comes memorable acting by veteran Urmila Matondkar . Photography captures the time , the violence , and flavor of rural Punjab very well . Others actors either did not act well , or did not get a chance to act . Direction is really the weakest link . The characters were not developed well . Not crisp , in contrast to " the Earth " , where even a 5-line character leaves a mark . The end is very interesting . This story could have several different ending - and all of them could have been equally good .
1 Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is an awesome movie . Its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003 . There are very good performances in it . Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila . she is like u have never seen before . one true great performance . along with her is a fine actor Manoj bajpai , who has shown bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre . The movie is about a girl(Urmila ) living in Pre - partition pakistan . she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town . she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going - on - for - years kinda fight with the punjabi family . and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila 's arranged marriage is due in few days . this movie is truly a very good movie . the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay . all the performances like lillete dubey , isha koppikar ( u wo nt believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on Khallas ) , kulbhushan kharbanda and many more . those sets with pre - partition pakistan , costumes , cinematography , sound , background score add to the positive points . from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question what s next ? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection . the ultimate scene is the end of the movie . i would suggest all those No - Kabhi - Khushi - Kabhi - gum - and - No - Dil - To - Pagal - Hai crowd to watch this amazing flick . my rating : 10/10 .
1 Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg , as an actor , that made me even more anxious to check out this flick . I remember he was interviewed on " Jay Leno , " and said that he turned down a role in the big - budget Adam Sandler comedy " The Longest Yard " to be in this film . So obviously , Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops . I 'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in " The Tenants . " There are certainly better rapper / actors , like Mos Def , who could 've done more with his role . But the point is Snoop did a " good " job . He ca n't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections , but that 's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing . The point is I found him convincing in the role , and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott 's character captivating . McDermott , by the way , gives the best performance in the film , though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop 's not - so - subtle acting . Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself , I could n't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating . It did aggravate me how Snoop 's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work , and berate him for criticizing it . But you know what ? I 'm sure a lot of writers are like that . His character was supposed to be flawed , as was McDermott 's , in his own way . My only mild criticism of the film would be its ending . For some reason , it just felt too rushed for me , though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters , rather than plot .
1 THE TENANTS began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased Bernard Malamud - writer / philosopher - examining the conflicts between Jews and African Americans in the incendiary atmosphere of Brooklyn at the time the book was written . As a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real : as transcribed into a screenplay by novices David Diamond and Danny Green ( who also directs ) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments.<br /><br />Harry Lesser ( Dylan McDermott ) is a Jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his ' newest ' book ten years into the writing . Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started . he is the sole tenant in a condemned Brooklyn tenement owned by Levinspiel ( Seymour Cassel ) who constantly tries to ' buy out ' Harry 's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished . Into this atmosphere enters another Black militant quasi - anti - Semitic writer Willie Spearmint ( Snoop Dogg ) whom Harry befriends , hides , and offers help to the nascent novelist 's attempt to write about the death of all white people . Harry 's attempts to help Willie lead to conflict , not the least of which is Harry 's meeting Willie 's girlfriend , the white Jewish Irene Bell ( Rose Byrne ) at a less than friendly gathering of Willie 's militant black brothers and sisters . Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel . When Willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by Harry , Willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers . The ending ' reveals the slippery nature of the human condition , and the human capacity for violence and undoing'.<br /><br />The actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters . The cinematography enhances the story , keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building . The musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters . Though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings , the film in the end is worth watching . At least it attempts to recreate Malamud 's bizarre look at life in the big city .

1 This is a very memorable spaghetti western . It has a great storyline , interesting characters , and some very good acting , especially from Rosalba Neri . Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic . She steals every scene she is in , and expresses so much with her face and eyes , even when she 's not speaking . Her performance is very believable . She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there 's anything wrong with being over the top ) . Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent , and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie , whether you want it to or not . There are a couple of parts that are very amusing . I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot . There 's also lots of slick gun - play that 's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was n't for two things . The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film . This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie . It is very poorly choreographed , and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight . One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy , but this is a more serious western , and the brawl really needed to be more realistic . The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma 's cowardly Mexican sidekick . I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something , but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this , and he was n't at all funny . All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him ? < br /><br />All that having been said , let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned , and all fans of the genre need to see this movie .
1 This wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun : GREAT music ( by one of the few .. if not the only .. female composer to work in the genre , Nora Orlandi ) , EXCITING action sequences ( and very vicious ones for the day ! ) , and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets ( all in Almeria , Spain , of course ) . It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it . The actors do marvelous jobs -- with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri ( in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western .. outside of Cardinale in Leone 's " Once Upon a Time in the West " ) . Without posting any spoilers , let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film I have EVER seen !
1 One of the more satisfying Western all'italiana , Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAI made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat , intelligent cinema.<br /><br />Johnny Yuma is , in most respects , not terribly original , but this actually does not count against it . The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience 's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements . Earlier , pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle ( or major ) twist that provide continuing interest . The quality of the execution is also , obviously , important . A tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience.<br /><br />Given these criteria , Johnny Yuma succeeds . There are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films . The setting is the brutal , twisted semi - feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best " Gothic family " westerns made 1964 - 1968 such as Tempo di massacre ( 1966 ) . The plot is a combination of the basic Fistful of Dollars ( 1964 ) plot and the Ringo films , a fact not surprising as screenwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved in both . Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of Cinecitta in the 1960s-70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre ( Along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors , directors , and screenwriters ) . In the FOD plot , the protagonist arrives in town , stirs up a tense situation , then undergoes a near - death followed by a resurrection ( in some films , like Quella sporca storia nel west ( 1968 ) it is quite literally a crucifixion ) . The Catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing , especially given the implicit populist / explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films . The Ringo plot , developed more fully by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma , a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community ( with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty).<br /><br />The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer from a Fistful of Dollar ( 1965 ) . The two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two . Numerous films , including Da uomo a uomo ( 1968 ) or even El Chuncho , quién sabe ? ( 1967 ) , use this relationship between an older and younger man ( father / son , older / younger brother , Anglo adviser / adversary and peasant revolutionary ) as a central dynamic to the plot.<br /><br />Additionally , there is the focus on deception and misdirection , mazes and mirrors , that recur throughout the best early WAI . The canons and pueblos of Almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse.<br /><br />What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of director Romolo Guerriri 's use of visual / psychological space together arrangement with the script 's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot . Dialogue was never very important to the WAI and often absurdly unintelligible ( thought there are exceptions , such as the cynical commentaries in Django ( 1966 ) or Faccia a faccia ( 1967).<br /><br />Psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery , it 's juxtapositions , and it 's description of the overall narrative situation . See how the presence of the deadly Samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the roof or from the background of the action . Or how Johnny strips Samantha and Pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch , hotel , even bedroom ( this , again , is a theme from FOD ) . Finally , note how there is a focus on the search for information . Like many elements , this is borrowed from FOD which was ultimately based on the hard - boiled mystery novel Red Harvest . It is through incidental contacts , wanted posters , overheard conversations , glances out of windows , watches left in the dust , or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it 's conclusion.<br /><br />The movie was notable in it 's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence . Of course , these films were hardly more violent than many American westerns . What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed , which is to say that it was not the violence but it 's meaning that had changed . Johnny Yuma is distinct and interesting in it 's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film.<br /><br />What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous , nameless audiences in Italy and Spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest . The artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site , a shard of cruse pottery , or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence , lives , that were significant simply because they existed . While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic worth , much of it 's interest for me derives from this connection and mystery.<br /><br />Top spaghetti western list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907<br /><br />Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889<br /><br />For fanatics only ( bottom of the barrel ) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849890
1 Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film ( so not really spoiler after all ) . Saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it . It 's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town . It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants . Among them a couple , where the wife is especially wicked . She lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert . We never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply . She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty . Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but that 's another story , which I do n't remember too good . The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film , who pretends to be anything but wicked - ca n't be compared with the witch in ' Snowwhite ' , who , in comparison is easy to find out . Very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing .
1 In the opening scene , the eye patch wearing desperado named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead , but when he follows Johnny into the pueblo , he 's shown with a scar over his patched eye . That 's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy ' spaghetti ' Western , but rather than detract from the picture , it adds a special flavor to the proceedings.<br /><br />Another occurs when Sanchez turns in his three dead bodies , they have to be examined for their identities - " You just ca n't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town " . Immediately after , Carradine ( Lawrence Dobkin ) shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand.<br /><br />As for the film 's principal Johnny Yuma ( Mark Damon ) , he 's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with Carradine following the barroom brawl . Johnny 's bound for San Margo at his uncle 's request , but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife Samantha ( Rosalba Neri ) and her conniving brother Pedro ( Louis Vanner ) . It takes some time getting there , but it 's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record . As for that saloon fight , I got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected.<br /><br />Care for some more story exaggerations ? Following the duel with Pedro the first time , Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear Pedro 's entire face with . Similarly , when Pedro smacks around little Pepe later in the film he does n't cut him , but by the time Johnny arrives , Pepe 's face is covered with blood.<br /><br />"Johnny Yuma " is probably one of the best of the genre that does n't have Clint Eastwood in it . As Johnny , Mark Damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior . Carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory Lee Van Cleef character , without being a total bad guy . At first the identity exchange between Carradine and Johnny did n't seem to make sense , but it all tied together by the time the film ended . You knew each henchman would wind up getting his due ; marking time for each was part of the anticipation.<br /><br />In case you 're wondering , the title hero has nothing to do with the Nick Adams character from the classic TV Western " The Rebel " . In this film , Johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in Yuma once.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil Samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout . After shooting Carradine she beats a hasty retreat before Johnny can get his revenge . Still alive , it looks like Carradine tries to shoot her and misses , but it does n't take long for Johnny and Sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water - Carradine aimed for her canteen .
1 After some difficulty , Johnny Yuma arrives at his ailing uncle 's ranch to take over day to day operations , only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold - digger wife and the woman 's vicious brother.<br /><br />Good production values , a likable performance by Mark Damon , and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining , if not exceptionally deep , above average addition to the spaghetti western genre.<br /><br />Co - star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European babes ever to grace the screen . Here she 's absolutely perfect as the cold - hearted user ( and abuser ) of weak men.<br /><br />Damon and Neri appeared together in at least one other picture , The Devil 's Wedding Night , a pretty good horror movie that 's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what 's underneath Rosalba 's dresses .
1 After the SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986 , I pretty much stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in . And since neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the Flintstone Kids seemed very promising to me , I " retired " and started sleeping in on Saturday mornings . I only returned to Saturday morning TV in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show . < br /><br />A new animated show of Superman was something I was not going to pass up . I was 17 and in high school at the time , but so what ! I loved this show . From what I can recall , this series was a gift to fans I suppose in celebration of Superman 's 50th birthday that particular year . It had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of John Williams movie score from the Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman movies . I honestly felt that the animation style Ruby Spears did was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team : Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera a few years before . Sadly , Danny Dark was not back as Superman , but I felt Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerdy like the Chris Reeve version . After hearing him as Reed Richards / Mr . Fantastic on the 90 's Fantastic Four , I could still see this version of Superman in my mind . Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane . LOL ! What a rhyme . She was a voice director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I guess she took it upon herself to do Lois . Memories of the SuperFriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast . Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor , who on the SuperFriends was formerly Firestorm . Perry White is none other than former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross , who on SuperFriends was Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers shows . And Lex Luthor , now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than SuperFriends voice alum , Michael Bell , whom I know best as Zan and the Riddler as well as many other characters on many other series . < br /><br />I felt this series was a combination of the movie Superman along with the post crisis John Byrne re envision of Superman , with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon , Jonathan and Martha Kent being alive to see Clark as Superman . The Bruce Timm series and Lois and Clark would also do this . Unfortunately , we never saw Brainiac , Bizarro , Toyman , Metallo , or Darkseid . Other than Luthor , we saw only the Prankster and we did see General Zod . I especially enjoyed that one episode with Wonder Woman , who was voiced over by BJ Ward who played her on the Super Powers Team as well . < br /><br />The episodes were smashing and I also enjoyed Clark 's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to Metropolis in the short little segment , Superman 's Family Album . < br /><br />The only two things I did n't like . It only lasted one season . And after Wonder Woman 's guest spot , I was hoping Batman would turn up voiced over by Adam West ( Still thinking about the Super Powers Team episodes I guess ) . I also hoped for it because on the Prankster episode , the Metropolis baseball team was pitted against the Gotham Goliaths . < br /><br />Every popular Super Hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare . For SpiderMan , I feel it 's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as Amazing Friends . For the Incredible Hulk , it 's the 1982 cartoon . For the Fantastic Four , it 's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot . For Batman , it 's the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by Filmation featuring BatMite . But for Superman , the rarest series is this one . < br /><br />Superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it . This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release . All in all , this 1988 version of Superman is well .... Super ! !
1 In my mind , this remains one of the very best depictions of Superman on TV , as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period.<br /><br />This series paid homage to both the Superman films of the ' 70s/'80s and the Superman comics series " reboot " of 1986-onward ( " Man of Steel , " " Superman Vol 2 , " " Action Comics , " " Adventures of Superman , " etc ) . The opening score and titles were stirring , based on the John Williams score from the films , updated for a Saturday morning action series . Marv Wolfman , one of the main contributors to the comics reboot ( writer of " Adventures of Superman " ) was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series . Overall , the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid - friendly.<br /><br />Superman was presented as believable , strong , and iconic . His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation . The Daily Planet characters Lois , Jimmy , and Perry were portrayed well . One of my favorite appearances was by Wonder Woman , and the story revolved around her home island of Themyscira ( " Paradise Island " ) . Both her design and that of her mother Hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted Wonder Woman comic book series of the era , and it seemed like an equally well - done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same.<br /><br />The one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on DVD / Blu - ray ! It deserves to be .
1 Kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents ' sex lives . And grown - up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido . Lastly , many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy , frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age.<br /><br />"The Mother " is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who is n't ready to stay home , watch " the telly , " and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades , and a controlling , dominating chap at that , packs it in with a massive heart attack.<br /><br />May ( Anne Reid ) and her husband have two children , each dysfunctional in his or her own way . The male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the Bankruptcy Court with her extravagant commercial venture . Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) , is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer . She 's attractive , not pretty , and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first.<br /><br />Back at her house after burying her husband , May determines to not stay there . Rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure , she goes to stay with Paula who has a young son . Paula 's boyfriend , Darren ( Daniel Craig ) , is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to May 's son 's house . May is quite taken with hard - drinking , coke - sniffing Darren whose treatment of Paula ought to have alerted May that he was , for sure , a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Cads.<br /><br />What follows is a torrid affair between Darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive ( dare I say reborn ? ) widow . The love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist May 's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama ( or debacle , take your pick).<br /><br />The theater in Manhattan was packed for today 's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of May 's age . That some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement . < br /><br />This blindingly honest look at an older woman 's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband 's desire that she stay at home and raise kids ( she also mentions he did n't like her to have friends - what a guy ) surfaces a number of issues . While May 's dalliance with Darren does n't constitute incest , there are real psychological dimensions , and issues , with a mother bedding her daughter 's lover . And Paula is n't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with . The affair , once disclosed , allows the peeling open of the mother - daughter relationship which , from Paula 's viewpoint , left something to be desired . Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother 's support as well as her love - she has n't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it is n't a bed of roses either.<br /><br />May is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect , indeed demand , a future of happiness . But she is also inescapably vulnerable . She 's fishing in uncharted emotional waters . Who controls her relationship with Darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand , much less resolve . In her sixties , she 's still a work in progress.<br /><br />"Something 's Got ta Give " recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited . After all it 's Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton cavorting in the world of the rich . And to insure that no serious psycho - social issues were explored , Keaton 's young girlfriend , Amanda Peet , daughter of Keaton , not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old(er ) would - be lover never hopped into the sack.<br /><br />No easy out here . Anne Reid 's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others . Her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others ( the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views).<br /><br />Kudos to director Roger Michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy.<br /><br />9/10 .
1 It 's hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as ' Notting Hill ' pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this , but well , here 's the evidence and it 's quite compelling . Several have alluded to TV drama , and yes , this does have a seventies Play for Today feel at times , but is always a cut above , mainly I think owing to some quite superlative acting from Anne Reid and to a fine script which shadow - boxes with cliché without ever getting one on the nose , except maybe right at the end . ( I did n't like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway , nor the oh - what - a - beautiful - morning final scene : she deserved a more studied finale than that I think , after all that hard work . The slippers business was a bit OTT too , on reflection).<br /><br />What I mean about avoiding cliché : well , I for one had a sinking expectation that the " mature " man May 's daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore , so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive , virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with . Instead , we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely , clumsy , not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow , who nevertheless does n't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman . It was around that point I started to sit up and pay more attention . Here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts . Almost Mike Leigh in that respect ( minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for).<br /><br />And of course I was , as everyone probably was , dumbfounded by what Anne Reid does with her character and with her body . She 's /not/ " the repressed , dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time " , this is far too simplistic for the character we have . Again and again there are allusions to her having been a " bad housewife " , not to mention that thing she does with trays , trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward . The daughter accuses her of having " sat in front of the TV all day " instead of , well , whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been : she has no answer . She never was a model wife and mother , at least not to herself - that 's where a lot of the poignancy comes from , the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply was n't good at , ever .
1 A fierce , shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote " My Beautiful Laundrette " , ( this is the best thing he 's done since then ) . It 's about intelligent people whose lives do n't add up to much . They 've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels . The only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex . He has his own motives but Kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion . This is a film in which people and places feel familiar , where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen . In some respects it 's a bit like " Sunday , Bloody Sunday " but it 's an altogether tougher piece of work . The director , Roger Michell , allows scenes to build instinctively . And it is beautifully acted.<br /><br />As the eponymous mother Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture . There is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived - in performance , and that very fine actor Daniel Craig displays shadings to his character than even Kureishi has n't tapped into . If the film strikes a false note it is , perhaps , in the character of the talentless daughter , caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces ( or should that be the other way round ) and even messier life , but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless . The film is also extremely beautiful to look at ( DoP Alwin Kuchler ) and must rank , unhesitatingly , as the best British film of the year .
1 [ WARNING : CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br /><br />I have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy . She came to mind when I reflected on the audience 's reaction to " The Mother . " < br /><br />People gasped when May ( Anne Reid ) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover , Darren ( Daniel Craig ) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings ' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex.<br /><br />Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ( " My Beautiful Laundrette , " " My Son the Fanatic " ) again proves why he 's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the Atlantic . His story 's not easy to take . This searing family drama is n't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it 's raw , complex , and often makes us very uncomfortable . Nevertheless , it 's powerfully good stuff.<br /><br />Kureishi and Roger Michell ( who directed " Notting Hill , " of all things ) craft an unsentimental , wrenching and superbly - acted portrait of an older woman who realizes , after all these years , she can and should still enjoy all of life 's pleasures . In a wonderfully epiphanous moment , when her son , Bobby , asks her not to be difficult , May shoots back , " Why not?" < br /><br />Why not , indeed.<br /><br />Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It 's subtle , restrained , powerful and sad , often all at the same time . Watch Reid when May observes Darren and Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub . Or , when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date . Reid 's eyes and face reveal all of May 's anguish and despair . In the film 's most devastating moment , May drops to her knees before Darren , willing to do anything for him , only asking him to be kind . This is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress.<br /><br />I enjoyed Michell 's use of natural sound , especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby 's place . It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots , the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them.<br /><br />This film , at times , reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh 's work , except " The Mother " hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat.<br /><br />My one quibble : Michell 's decision to give May and Darren 's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility . The lovers remain out of focus while , in the foreground , a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze . And the only sound is of May in the throes of passion.<br /><br />The problem with Michell 's approach is that both Reid and Craig , who completely envelops the role of Darren , plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it 's unfair to hide their characters ' almost primitive energy from the audience . Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral.<br /><br />This film does n't have immensely likable characters . We sympathize with May , but she , too , causes her daughter 's suffering . But I doubt Kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk . His point , I believe , was to unmask a family that 's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens . It 's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable .
1 Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate , I have to say that The Mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />I'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it , and even if they had , they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters.<br /><br />The story is revealed slowly and realistically . The acting is superb , the characters are believably flawed , and the dialogue is sensitive . I tried many times to predict what was going to happen , and I was always wrong , so I was very intrigued by the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie . And I must confess , I 'll forever look at my mom in a different light !
1 ' The Mother ' is that extraordinary piece of film making - it gets you thinking , it pulls no punches - and ultimately it leaves you thinking . Very much open - ended as to the lead character 's fate . Anne Reid ( which I only knew briefly from her appearances in some Victoria Wood - led projects and thought a fine comedienne ) is truly superb here . Not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all . And not all that free - spirited and adventurous at first . She plays her character just with the right note that rings true ( well , it did to me ) . Powerful cast . Great script . Renaissance of European cinema indeed ;)
1 A woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her son 's friend and handy man . In a slightly twisted story , the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself . The twisted part ? The handy man is also her daughter 's on and off love interest.<br /><br />As if this was n't strange enough , the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out , she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother.<br /><br />Though you may think badly of this woman , the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light . Beautifully played by Anne Reid , this character has dimension and portrays great emotion.<br /><br />A truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film.<br /><br />8/10
1 At the beginning of the film we watch May and Toots preparing for their trip to London for a visit to their grown children . One can see Toots is not in the best of health , but he goes along . When he dies suddenly , May 's world , begins to spin out of control.<br /><br />The film directed by Roger Michell , based on a screen play by Hanif Kureshi , is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she does n't even know it existed until now.<br /><br />May 's life as a suburban wife was probably boring . Obviously her sexual life was next to nothing . We get to know she 's had a short extra marital affair , then nothing at all . When May loses her husband she ca n't go back home , so instead , she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter 's home . It is in this setting that May begins lusting after young and hunky Darren , her daughter 's occasional lover.<br /><br />Darren awakes in May a passion she has not ever known . May responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes . May , who at the beginning of the film is dowdy , suddenly starts dressing up , becoming an interesting and attractive woman . She ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before.<br /><br />Having known a couple of cases similar to this story , it came as no surprise to me to watch May 's reaction . Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce , a widower , ends up frustratingly for May , who realizes how great her sex is with Darren . The younger man , we figure , is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from May. Finally , the daughter , Helen discovers what Mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made.<br /><br />The film is a triumph for the director . In Anne Reid , Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May. Also amazing is Daniel Craig . He knows how Darren will react to the situation . Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back . Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part as Bruce the older man in Helen 's class and is quite effective.<br /><br />The film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind.<br /><br / >
1 This is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity . Anne Reid , previously best known in the UK for her TV roles including ' Dinnerladies ' ( a Victoria Wood scripted series on in - company catering workers , if you 're wondering ) , gives a performance of finely judged understatement as May , a late-60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner - London borough . Her husband Toots ( Peter Vaughan ) dies on their visit to the male of the latter species ( Bobby ) , and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by Bobby and his family . May 's teacher daughter Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) lives nearby , however , and the relationship between May and Paula initially appears closer . Thus when May decides she can not live in her own home and comes back to London , she is able to stay in Paula 's house and do some child - minding of Paula 's more appreciative offspring.<br /><br />It is on May 's visits to Bobby 's house that she embarks on an affair with Darren , a mid-30s friend of Bobby who is working on a house extension . In what may be the first mainstream British film to so portray it , it is May and not Darren ( Daniel Craig * ) who initiates the encounter , and , at least to begin with , it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect . There is no explicit sexual content ( at least in the DVD I saw : differences in the IMDb cast list suggests the existence of other versions ) , and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively . More strongly portrayed is the relationship between May and daughter Paula , a recent convert to ' therapy and self - exploration ' , who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her . Paula is also Darren 's lover , and when she finds May 's explicit but rather poor drawings of Darren and May together , things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion . Only in an English film , perhaps , could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother , politely ask her to stand up , and duly wallop her.<br /><br />In the mean time , May is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older ( of her own generation ) member of Paula 's writing group . The contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with Darren is clearly made ; it is at that point that May starts to acquiesce to Paula , and Darren 's worm begins to turn ( he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money , if not all along , but for some of the ride ) . So May finds herself superfluous to both of her children 's needs , and finally does return home ( but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new).<br /><br />The film 's strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent - sibling relationships , where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no - one to care for them . This is not new , but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over-60s may well be . The darkness of the film 's content , from a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi , stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit ( it seems to be perpetual summer ) , and the overall mood is uplifting - it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy England . The ending is perhaps under - written , as we do n't know where May is going or for how long - perhaps she 's Shirley Valentine with a pension , she 's certainly no Picasso . Anne Reid is , however , revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever . Like Julie Andrews in Torn Curtain ( said by Paul Newman ) , " There goes your Mary Poppins { read Dinnerladies } image for good".<br /><br / > * Yes , he : announced Oct 2005 as the new James Bond .
1 Wow . Saw this last night and I 'm still reeling from how good it was . Every character felt so real ( although most of them petty , selfish a**holes ) and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter 's feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing . Top performances all round but hats off to Anne Reid and Our Friends in the North 's Daniel Craig ( the latter coming across as the next David Thewlis).<br /><br />And director Roger Michell ? This is as far from Notting Hill as it 's possible to be . Thank God.<br /><br />Watch this movie ! ! !
1 I am embarrassed to say that I missed " The Mother " when it was in theaters . I saw it this evening on DVD . I gave it a 10 vote , one of the very few I have given here . This English independent is filmed with such great care and quality . It drew me in relentlessly . The story , low - keyed and purely human , is brutally honest and utterly absorbing , thanks to the acting of Anne Reid , Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw . The cinematography is stunning . The score is hard - wired to the plot . The storyline is epic , brilliantly clothed by writer Hanif Kureishi in mundane lives . This story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting . And some of those big issues are highly controversial , which probably explains the lack of awards won , despite many nominations . It is simply one of my all - time favorite films .
1 I somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend 's recommendation . I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate dramatic film , which does so many things so well . The writing is crisp , realistic , nuanced , and even restrained . The cinematography and editing are understated but inspired , enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close - ups and framing of images , capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways . The acting is also wonderful , with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer . They reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected , raw vulnerability . A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi , and the rest of the team . A must see for serious film lovers .
1 What a moving film . I have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people do n't see her anymore , and she longs for companionship . Being in my late 40s I am beginning to see what she has been complaining about . You are no longer youthful , beautiful or touchable . When May says " ... this lump of a body ... " wow . How our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful . I love when she begins to change what she wears ... the colorful scarf ... no longer the frumpy wife.<br /><br />It is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time . Sad in that May betrays her daughter 's trust ... beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair , and chooses to move on and finally have her own life . I love the character 's daring to even initiate the love affair.<br /><br />Mostly I love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships , be they familial or not . We see Paula 's vulnerability , yet she will have what she wants at all costs ... (when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for Darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if Darren even wants a child ) . The movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change , and yet reveals what has been there all along , dormant . May has stifled her own creativity to raise a family . A family that she did n't really want , but was " something you just did when she was young " . I love the scene when Darren calls her an old tart , and she smiles and says " I was never called that before " . It was truly a gem of a movie.<br /><br />And Daniel Craig . Well , i just love him . I was pleasantly surprised . Not only is he pleasant on the eyes , he is a real talent . What a neat role . He is much more than any 007 that is for sure and I look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature . The scene where he is pleasuring May and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman , and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her . He is actually enjoying giving her pleasure . A wonderful scene . The contrast is the love scene with Bruce . Bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure ... two completely different men.<br /><br />Alas ... I wonder where is my Darren ?
1 With the death of her infirmed husband , May , an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible , dead from the neck down , and unwelcome in the pseudo- sophisticated yuppie homes of her son , Bobby and his shallow wife , Helen , and Paula , a self- absorbed , clinging , and minimally talented daughter . The central family is anything but warm , supportive , and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband . The Mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies , the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else . < br /><br />As May comes to realize the world is still important to her , the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter 's boyfriend , a carpenter and rough sort . May embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with Darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first , but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him.<br /><br />This is the kind of role Hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them , but would never appear in because the film 's frankness , overt sexuality , unglamorous wardrobe , little makeup , and social commentary on the vapidness of the very society most film industry women are enchrenched . The performance by the lead actress , Anne Reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face - lift , hair extensions , and liposuction . She bares more than her soul for the screen.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is the enabling handyman , Derrek who beds both mother and daughter . He turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow 's situation , but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen - house . His aimless character 's inability to say no to the ex - wife , boring girlfriend , and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence . While good with his hands at building a conservatory , he is unable to construct meaning in his life.<br /><br />One of the best films from Britain in years , it is simply adult in its storyline . The Mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for American audiences to tolerate having no car chase , no bling , no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by TV starlets and buff studmuffins . The Mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook , send to the retirement home , and get out of the way . May does n't know what to do as she is made alive by Darren , is n't willing to go to the old folks home , and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age .
1 Kureishi has n't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing . Recent adapted travesty 's like ' Intimacy ' have ruined great writing . But The Mother surpasses all his previous incarnations , eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundrette . A middle - aged woman overcomes widow - hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally - weak daughter . The fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing . And in Daniel Craig we have a strutting , brash , gruff anti - hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother . Beautifully shot , the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters , but as a study of inconceivable lust , it 's a winner .
1 I went to this movie only because I was dragged there and I would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and I felt out of place . However , the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people . The characters were all very real and believable and I found myself discussing the film , the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards . There are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better . All in all , this is a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film can not be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream . It 's a thrilling and interesting movie experience .
1 " The Mother " is a weird low - budget movie , touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema : denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter , and lust and passion in the third age.<br /><br />The characters are awful : May is a disgusting old lady and I believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her . She confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter . She cheated her husband twice with an intellectual . She steals the beloved man of her daughter , not to protect her from a guy without moral , that does not love her , but just because she feel horny with him . She is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way , destroying her daughter delusions . Paula , her daughter , is a fragile loser , who accepts her life the way it is . Her brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife , who insists in having her shop , a terrible business indeed . Darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody , even himself.<br /><br />The acting and direction are excellent : the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise . I liked this movie , but I recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Recomeçar " ( " Re - Start " )
1 While movie titles contains the word ' Mother ' , the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother 's love for her children.<br /><br />However , The Mother tells a different story.<br /><br />The Mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child , or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child . Here , Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother 's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.<br /><br />Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond , here , he plays Darren , a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother , and sleeping with her daughter as well . Anne Reid , who was a familiar face on TV series , takes up the challenging role of the leading character , May.<br /><br />The story begins with May coping with the sudden loss of her husband , Toots , in a family visit to her son , Bobby . While she befriends Darren , a handyman who is doing some renovation in Bobby 's house , she was shocked to found out that her daughter , Paula , was sleeping with Darren . At the same time , May was coping with life after the death of Toots . Fearing that Harry and Paula do not wanted her , May starts to find her life going off track , until she spends her afternoon with Darren.<br /><br />Darren was nice and friendly to May , and May soon finds some affection on Darren . Instead of treating him like a friend , she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple . Later , May found sexual pleasure from Darren , where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else . And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family.<br /><br />The Mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life , and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on . This can be told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her , where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.<br /><br />Anne Reid has made a breakthrough for her role of May , as she was previously best well known for her various role on TV series . As she do not have much movies in her career resume , The Mother has put her on the critic 's attention . Daniel Craig , on the other hand , had took on a similar role in his movie career , such as Sylvia ( 2003 ) and Enduring Love ( 2004 ) . If his reprising role of James Bond fails , film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career , and The Mother is one of them.<br /><br />The Mother may not be everyone 's favorite , but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones , accompanied by butter and jam .
1 " If I sit down I will never stand up again " , that 's what the mother ( the one of the title ) says to his son when he tells her to get some rest ( she 's just widowed ) . He means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do : to rest in peace , to neglect herself . But she 's not in the mood for " resting " , not yet . She also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life ... Suddenly , the revelation comes : sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her ( Daniel Craig , the brand new James Bond ) when she " thought nobody would ever touch her again " . It is a story that makes you reflect on many things , specially on what 's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies . It does n't look that we 've advanced that such in those aspects . I mean , nobody 's surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it was otherwise ? An old woman , a young guy ... nah , you ai n't ready for that , are you?<br /><br />The movie has intimist tones all along its length , except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul - mouthed dialogs . Those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother 's love affair ( pretty absurd -you'll know what I mean when you watch it- ) are the only discordant elements in " The Mother " . < br /><br />*My rate : 7/10
1 May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren . The visit is awkward because the grandchildren and " kids " do n't really seem to know each other as one might expect . The warmth that should be there is missing . After dinner , May 's husband says he does n't feel well , blames it on his daughter 's cooking , and irritably says he wants to go home . He dies that night.<br /><br />May , now a widow , is lost . She clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one , but she had a purpose . She had someone who needed her , and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years , she had something to do with her days.<br /><br />She is depressed and unmotivated . She goes to stay with her daughter , Paula , who shortly after her mother 's arrival , lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all . She lets loose with anger over her mother 's lack of nurturing . May seems disarmed and surprised , yet she also does n't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right . " I 'm your mother and I love you . " What does really say ? ( I 've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means . ) Paula is a bit ( well , more than a bit ) neurotic . Both women are needy , though they show it very differently.<br /><br />Paula has been involved with a friend of her son 's , Darren , who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son . While Paula is working during the day , May begins to have conversations and lunches with Darren . Darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son , Nicky , but supposedly does n't live in the home with his wife.<br /><br />May becomes attracted to Darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have . Darren becomes attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life . ( He also becomes too interested in money that May says she can give him to " get away from it all , " though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey . They end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day , and May enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years , nor had ever expected to know again . As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave the married Darren , this becomes part of May 's rationalization that what she is doing is okay.<br /><br />At a writing group that Paula leads , May is introduced , rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted . There is one scene where she has sex with the older man , who clearly can barely perform , and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on May 's face as she endures the one - time ghastly liaison.<br /><br />Eventually , Paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother , that indeed her mother and Darren have been having sex.<br /><br />This film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways . Sympathies will be divided . At one point , during Paula 's writing group , May reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day , and would leave for pubs after they were asleep , making sure to get back home before her husband.<br /><br />Clearly , a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub . May , however , also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband did n't like her having any friends , so she did n't have any . She did what he wanted her to do . She was miserable but she put up with it because , as she said , " it was easier . " So , while May was not the best mother , for those inclined to have any sympathy for her , one might see May 's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for " a few minutes " in her lifetime . A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her , to know her as a human being , to have a friend and a lover.<br /><br />Paula , though neurotic and unhappy , perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her . Certainly , it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother.<br /><br />It is a well - done film , with more complexities than I have mentioned , and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many , perhaps conflicting , reactions . It is a film worth discussing and debating , and above all , worth seeing.<br /><br />One thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life . No matter who is deemed " right " or who is deemed ' wrong " by each viewer , that theme of old age and loneliness , evoking a sense of dread in most of us , is inescapable .
1 " The Mother " tells of a recently widowed mid-60 's mother of two adult children ( Reid ) who , on the heels of her husband 's death , finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter 's married lover . The film dwells on the quietly passive Mom , her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter , the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover , and the convolutions arising therefrom . A somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents , " The Mother " does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism . Will play best with more mature audiences , possibly women , who may better empathize with the central character , her needs and issues . ( B+ )
1 This is a really interesting film . It 's the first time I have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist . For the director of Notting Hill this is a bold move to something serious
1 The Mother is one of those films that you know is good , maybe even great , but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in.<br /><br />The story is potentially distasteful in many ways : the death of a character within the first half hour , the December - May romance , the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother , the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty - something characters , the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives . This movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 , but is a throw back to a collection of British ( usually made - for - TV ) movies from the late 1980 's - it has a moral severity that never lets up , which produces an enveloping throbbing angst.<br /><br />The Mother is flawless , but that is in part the problem ; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of script , some lesser actors - it takes the edge off , but if such a film is so pitch perfect , the experience of watching it is raw and painful . Even the technical qualities - lighting , editing , etc . - make the viewer ache ; the London in this movie is bright and open , filled with harsh , cutting light.<br /><br />If you are tough as nails , or are one of those super - sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut - wrenching sad movies or novels , then you will enjoy The Mother . Anyone in between , give it a miss , or be prepared to squirm . And be warned : as tough as the movie is from beginning to near - end , the worst is to come.<br /><br />Toward the end of the movie , the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it ( for having slept with her boyfriend ) , and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her . The mother agrees to this , they both stand up , and - instead of a well primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer 's blow . Argh ! ! !
1 I am a college student studying a - levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film , in the mother . Whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film , any comment would much greatly appreciated . The comments will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam . So if you have any views at all , i m sure i can put them to use and you could help me get an A ! I am also studying ' About a Boy ' and ' Tadpole ' so if you have seen these films as well , i would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page . Thank you .
1 Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance . The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey , as I tuned in there 's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent.<br /><br />It turns out that eponymous mother 's carpenter love interest is also the daughter 's boyfriend , so there 's trouble brewing and not too many surprises . But I 'd been caught by Anne Reid 's compelling performance and I was hooked . The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves , when she exudes sadness.<br /><br />The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo - breaking . Should n't older women 's bodies remain covered up ? Not here and we 're treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mother 's sexuality . Even more startling are the drawings she 's made that ( SPOILER ! ) once discovered confirm her daughter 's suspicion that something 's going on here.<br /><br />Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did n't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast , but that could be me . With her waves of pre - Raph locks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla , whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind . Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did n't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses.<br /><br />The ending is weak . If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close - ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons . Whatever she 's done , she 's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years , and I found the lack of sympathy jarring . For a film so full of emotion ( and be warned it 's like opening champagne , you 'll never get the lid back on ) the ending is a cold contradiction .
1 As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale , this film with the new Bond starring in it was shown , from director Roger Michell ( Notting Hill ) . I almost turned it off for being a bit boring , but I 'm glad I stuck with it . Basically May ( Anne Reid ) is a single mother of Helen ( Anna Wilson - Jones ) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years . Her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend , Darren ( Daniel Craig , of course ) . After knowing each other only a few days , May and Darren have a secret affair . And at her age , with a 30-something , and the new Bond ? ! Anyway , they obviously want to keep it a secret , but May has regrets and wonders if Helen will find out . When she does , Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact , Helen asks her permission to hit her . Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots , Danira Govich as Au Pair , Harry Michell as Harry , Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English 's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce . Very good !
1 Fully deserving its prestigious Hollywood award nomination , this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises . Outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot ( and re - shoot ) of a WW1 trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non - com and the hapless McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman messenger  all under the beady eye of Ralph Sanford 's delightfully irascible Anguish ; a lost McDoakes guided and re - guided by equally perplexed Jack Carson ; assistant director Chandler rejoicing in a McDoakes - sent opportunity : " I 'm going to be a director ! " < br /><br />Ace comic O'Hanlon has a dual role , playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes ! Oddly , Richard L. Bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series , has turned down that opportunity here . In real life , Bare 's a youngish , six - foot Rock Hudson lookalike , but here he 's impersonated by veteran actor ( over 500 movies ! ) , Jack Mower .
1 This particular Joe McDoakes short subject was obviously inspired by the all star Warner Brothers spectacular Thank Your Lucky Stars , one of those all star wartime morale boosters of the period . In that one Eddie Cantor played both himself and a would be comedian who 'd like to break into films except for his resemblance to Cantor.<br /><br />George O'Hanlon who starred in the McDoakes shorts is both himself and McDoakes who 's just trying to get a break in film . Like Thank Your Lucky Stars a few Warner Brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this film.<br /><br />O'Hanlon 's been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a World War I film , but lookalike McDoakes gets the message . The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment , he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line . Maybe sounding like a real movie star would help.<br /><br />86 takes later to the exasperation of director Ralph Sanford and the patient Clyde Cook who plays a British cockney soldier they do find a niche in the film business for poor McDoakes . It 's worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an Oscar to find out what happens to O'Hanlon / McDoakes.<br /><br />Both of them .
1 This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I 've seen and so far the funniest one . In this one , Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman . When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio ( the company behind this series , incidentally ) , he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused . Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon ( who 's also McDoakes ) who speaks in his more normal voice that 's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director . I 'll stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end . The final scene was especially a hoot so on that note , go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres !
1 I 've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week . This is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60 's and on through the 70's . Woodstock , Easy Rider , The Beatles , The Death of Morrison , Hendrix , Joplin are all here . Vh1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the " Drug Years " . From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the American culture . From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country , the hippie movement , the conservative resistance , and how drugs effected the arts ( music , movies etc . ) Featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage.<br /><br />Drug Films : The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
1 I would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am so darn proud of him . This mini - series that in shown on VH1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it . The amount of time and effort that I have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all ( Ca n't Find My Way Home ) makes it that much better to watch him on TV . I know that he loves what he does and he does it well . His eloquence is shown in the interviews , which he did himself , and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary . From the music to the videos and everything in between , this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it . I appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it ( or did n't ) and would love to hear from fans ! Three cheers for uncle Martin ! ! !
1 I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff 's book " Ca n't Find My Way Home " which is chock full of info on the drug culture of America , spanning the years 1945 - 2000 . This guy knows his stuff ! ! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary . I particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era , and the 70 's stoner culture . The soundtrack was excellent . Whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era . Hopefully they will package them and sell them as a CD set . I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960 's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it . One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung ( played by Johnny Depp in the movie " Blow " ) , who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80 's .
1 I personally watched this to see the footage of the 60 's and 70 's . It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life . The interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous . You feel like you 're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time ... because it feels so good and familiar . I loved it , all segments from 60's - present day . I highly recommend this for all aspects , including rock music , the hipper movement , politics and good ' ol history . I check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler , only because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards , since I discussed what 's in all 4 segments , so just wanted to be safe .
1 I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it . I think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly IT HAS A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE ALL GENERATIONS . There is woodstock , there are Joplin 's , Hendrix 's and Jim Morrison 's deaths , there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse . It completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways . In my opinion this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the TV in these days . I am waiting for the DVD release . You should definitely see it ! ! ! This movie is stunning-- BIG TIME !
1 If you lived through the 60s , this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous . It 's all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time . These are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out : " do n't speak too soon for the wheel 's still in spin , for the times they are a - changin ' " . While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and it 's dissemination at the time , that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia , influencing engineers , scientists and aiding in the hyper - development of computer related activities . A salute to the filmmakers from one who was there - you 've captured the era better than I 've seen before .
1 The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini - series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV . It 's actually not long enough , in a way . All of the major bases in the decades are covered , and they 're all interesting to note as views into post - modern history and from different sides . But it almost does n't cover enough , or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time . For example , the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs ( partly the marijuana , later cocaine ) is really well presented , but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover.<br /><br />Overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs , pop - culture , government intervention , the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia , all felt the wave of various drugs over the years , and the interplay between all was very evident . Nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot)- goes to endorse drugs outright , but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun , and then tragic , about taking certain drugs . The appearances of various staunch , ridiculously anti - drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and America 's connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees . The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not ' just say no ' , because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought . It is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them ( as , for example , oxycontin continues on in the marketplace).<br /><br />Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary ? No , but for some summertime TV viewing for the young ( i.e. my age ) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago , as well as for the ' old ' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks , careless times , and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it . There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased , which is not totally untrue , but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social , political , and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving ( for better or obvious worse ) for enough of a fascinating view .
1 This is an entertaining " history " of the FBI , but it should be viewed as fiction , because that 's exactly what it is . What else could it be when J. Edgar Hoover personally approved and had a cameo role in the production . James Stewart is excellent , as usual , and the supporting cast , except for the talentless Vera Miles , is good . Murray Hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as Stewart 's partner and best friend . The FBI accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true . What is significant is what it leaves out.<br /><br />One of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the killing of John Dillinger . It is portrayed pretty much as it happened , but no mention at all is made of Melvin Purvis , the Chicago Bureau Chief who headed the operation . Instead , the operation is depicted as if the fictional Chip Hardesty were running it . It has been said that Hoover was jealous of the publicity that Purvis received after Dillinger was killed ; Purvis was subsequently transferred to a remote outpost , and shortly afterward left the FBI . This is no doubt why Purvis was never mentioned in the film . But this viewer , at least , paused to think that if Purvis was treated this way , what about all the agents who conducted all the other operations depicted in the film . Were they also completely ignored and replaced by the fictional Hardesty.<br /><br />The film is probably accurate in its portrayal of FBI activity up through the end of WWII . However , after that point , the film would have us believe that the only threat facing the US came from international communism , which is no doubt what Hoover believed . Never mind the Mafia . Never mind the lynchings that were still going on in the South . Never mind that blacks were being intimidated to keep them from voting in much of the South . I do n't know if the FBI had started wiretapping Martin Luther King by the time this film was made , but if not , it was n't very long afterward that it started.<br /><br />As I said at the outset , this is pretty good entertainment , but it should be viewed as the sanitized fictionalization that it is .
1 In the tradition of G - Men , The House On 92nd Street , The Street With No Name , now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light . While it 's 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive , it would be showed in no other kind of light.<br /><br />The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it 's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out . It 's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it . Some of that time is covered in the film as well.<br /><br />But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John ' Chip ' Hardesty was created . Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.<br /><br />In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency . It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film . Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration . When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in , he did just that . < br /><br />Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold . In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI 's story itself . Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple . We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with , arresting Ku Klux Klan members , a plot to murder oil rich Indians , bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties , their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War.<br /><br />There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own . That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight . Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.<br /><br />Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American . Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one.<br /><br />The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart 's best films , but it 's the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me . If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts , I 'd feel a lot better about it . There 's also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson.<br /><br />Vera Miles did n't just marry Stewart , she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates . It 's dated mostly , but still has a good and interesting story to tell .
1 < br /><br />Have you ever felt like your being watched , like someone keeps tabs on every move you make ? Well , just remember before you decide to break the law , the FBI will always be there . At least that 's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama , The FBI story . It traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world ( in 1959 ) , by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents , Chip Hardesty ( James Stewart).<br /><br />Chip was with the FBI from day one , and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world , even occasionally his family . The FBI Story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent , and how being one affects his personal life . The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them . The audience gets to see Chip stop Ku Klux Klan riots , go undercover to solve an Indian murder / estate scandal , bring fugitives into custody , rescue hostages , and helped fight in WWII . He even helped bring Communist spies to justice.<br /><br />Stewart , in a vaguely complex performance , is stellar ( as always ) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much . One of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both Chip 's family life and his job . We witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son . We also observe his wife having a miscarriage , and his marriage having rocky times . Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job . Vera Miles gives a spotty performance , but it 's very convincing , none the less . She was never a brilliant actress , but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her . Well maybe that 's just me ? Sadly , none of the other performances are worth mentioning , but the attention - grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested.<br /><br />The cinematography of this film was impressive , especially the scenes in the South American jungles . The colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film . Perhaps the greatest part of this movie was Mervyn Leroy 's fabulous direction . Every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story . It 's chock full of ingenious camera shots , some with a very Hitchcockian feel.<br /><br />All in all , The FBI Story is a spectacular , but overlooked film . Clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated , but if you get the chance I recommend jumping into this one . I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart 's spectacular performance , and the captivating story .
1 This is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about J.Edgar Hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting Klansmen , going after Indian killers , hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930 's , fighting Nazi 's in the US and South America during world war 2 and Commies in New York during the early 1950 's . Of course in 1959 we did not know about Mr. Hoover 's obsession for keeping secret files on honest Americans , bugging people like the Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr , but worst of all , his secret love affair with his deputy director , Clyde Tolson ( If you want to know more about that subject , I suggest seeing the film Citizen Cohn ) . Hoover aside , This story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes for a decent , but dated film . Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good . But Jimmy is the movie . As much as Hoover controlled production and always made sure the FBI was seen without fault , Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side , quite an achievement considering Hoover was always looking over his shoulder . The background score is also pleasant . I have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film . Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten . TCM was the last network to show it a long time ago and I hope they show it again .
1 Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who is serving when Hagarty 's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake . I watched this movie on a video that I had taped off of the television . When I watched this scene I thought I recognized the voice of Jones when the " waiter " laughed at the end . I rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter . Listen closely as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby , then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter , albeit , quickly .
1 I first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on DVD.<br /><br />James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty , a hardworking and dedicated FBI agent . His life in the Bureau is intercut with his family life , which is not all rosy . His wife ( an excellent portrayal by Vera Miles ) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job , and they even separate for a time ; Chip 's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall ( Murray Hamilton ) is killed in a gunfight ; Chip 's son , Mike , enlists in the Marines during World War II . Through it all , the family carries on with bravery and dignity.<br /><br />The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi - documentary style of the film works effectively . And the music by Max Steiner says it all ; fidelity , bravery and integrity.<br /><br />This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and , yes , to J. Edgar Hoover as well . If Mr. Hoover 's type of vigilance had been observed , we might have been spared 9/11 , the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we 've had to put up with since his passing .
1 The movie has a great written genre story . It features all of the usual Columbo ingredients ; The way Lt . Columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect , the way the mystery unravels for him , Columbo 's dog , the cat and mouse play , which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor , mostly involving the Columbo character . It 's all written despite the fact that it does n't even have a truly original concept . Columbo hunting down a detective / murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie.<br /><br />It 's also an extremely well directed movie from James Frawley , who after this directed 5 more Columbo movies , in the ' 70 's and ' 80 's . He provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences.<br /><br />It 's one of the slower moving Columbo movies , despite not having a too long running time . This style and approach does n't always work out well for a Columbo movie but in this movie it does , which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie.<br /><br />Most Columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film - making , as the movie its murderer . This movie stars the rather unknown 81 year old Ruth Gordon . She did n't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some , mostly for her role in " Rosemary 's Baby " , which also won her an Oscar . She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting , which some people might not like though . It earned her 4 more Oscar nominations throughout her career , prior to her win for " Rosemary 's Baby " , in 1969 . She has some great interaction as well with Peter Falk in their sequences together.<br /><br />The movie also stars a still young G.D. Spradlin . I say young because I only know him from his latest productions out of his career , despite the fact that he already was 57 at the time of this Columbo production . He is still alive but retired from acting , ever since 1999.<br /><br />An even better than usual Columbo movie entry.<br /><br />8/10
1 I like this episode quite a bit , Ruth Gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was . As has been stated , the music is very good , and it has a moodiness that does n't exist in all episodes.<br /><br />But one major plot hole exists , so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it . It is established that the light does n't work in the vault . Do n't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked ? You 'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note . Granted this is TV whodunit fiction , and various holes will always be found , but this seems much too glaring.<br /><br />It really does n't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light does n't work but the " death bed " testimony goes on unfound , apparently for days .
1 I loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact . While I like when a episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one , its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode , along with the uncovering of the murderer.<br /><br />The interplay between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless . At one point , Gordon , playing a famous writer , makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lt . Columbo , making a tongue - in - cheek allusion to the detective 's real life fame as a crime - solver . This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments .
1 This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha - Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe . Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation , while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York . He manages , however , to leave behind some clues , scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well - hidden note . Columbo enters the case , suspects her at once , and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers . Oh , and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon 's secretary and would - be blackmailer . Hartley is , I believe , the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner . I 'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button , which is on display during a belly dance sequence , but I 've always admired Skinner anyway.<br /><br />The murder is well handled . It 's a good plot , and none of the performers or crew fluff anything . But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon , only a skosh over five feet tall . She was over 80 years old and looked it . There are moments when she almost teeters , but she consistently exudes charm . Her acting is idiosyncratic . You can never be sure when she 's being serious or when she 's putting Columbo and the audience on . She 's given some good lines too . What humor there is comes from Gordon . Columbo does n't have any of his frequent comic moments.<br /><br />All in all , a nice job by everyone concerned .
1 * * SPOILERS * * Since the disappearance at sea of her favorite niece Phyllis murder mystery writer Abigail Mitchell , Ruth Gordon , has strong suspicions that it was Phyllis ' husband Edmund Galvin , Charles Frank , who was responsible for her death . In fact Abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident.<br /><br />Knowing that there 's no evidence to have Edmund arrested for Phyillis ' death and deciding to take the law into her own hands Abigail cooks up this elaborate plan to do him in and make it look , like Phyllis ' death , a tragic accident . Getting Edmund to secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination to her walk - in safe , as she 's about to leave on vacation for New York City , Abigail tricks him into going inside locking the startled and surprised Edmund in . With the safe being soundproof nobody at the mansion the butler maid and Abigail 's personal secretary Veronica , Mariette Hartley , hear him screaming for help and the next day Edmund is found suffocated to death . Veronica discovered Edmund 's body as she was about to put away , for safe keeping , Abigail 's latest murder mystery manuscript.<br /><br />Lt . Columbo , Peter Falk , is called on the case involving the strange death of Edmund Garvin to determine if it 's a murder or a tragic accident . Going through Edmund 's apartment Columbo is puzzled to find out that he does n't have a single photo of his late wife , who 's been missing for just a month ! This ties into what Abigail always felt about him in Edmund not being in love with Phyllis and also a suspect in her , in Abigail 's mind , murder . < br /><br />Columbo a big fan , together with his wife , of Abigail 's murder mystery novels has a hard time realizing that she in fact was responsible for Edmund 's death . All the evidence points to Abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was Edmunds . This all proved that Abgail was in fact in the house , not on her way to the airport , when Edmund was locked inside the walk - in safe.<br /><br />Going through all the evidence Columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is . That conclusion is quickly checkmated when it 's found out that Edmund did n't even have a pen or pencil as well as light , with the safe light - bulb burned out , on him to write it . There 's also something very odd that 's inside the safe that has been on Lt . Columbo 's mind ever since he came on the case . This has to do with the black paint residue that was found under the dead Edmund 's fingernails and on his belt buckle ! < br /><br />It 's that evidence , when put together with a number of other items in the safe , that in the end hangs Edmund 's murder on the tricky and very cunning mystery writer Abigail Mitchell . Edmund let Abigail unknowingly convict herself in his final attempt as the air in the safe was being used up , by his breathing , in using burnt out matchsticks to write on Abigail last manuscript who murdered him : Abigail Mitchell !
1 I have n't really seen too many of the Columbo films ... actually , I think I 've only watched one or two , apart from this one . I 've always liked Columbo , though , somehow without even having seen that much of him . Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character , because of his looks , his voice and his charm . The perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968 , the latest(and probably not last ) of the films was made in 2003 . That 's 35 years . And Falk was 40 back when he made the first one . The series consists of 68 films(unless my count is off ) , all of which are made for TV . Everyone knows the character , even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema . That is quite an accomplishment , if you ask me . The plot is pretty good . The only problem I have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning(though that may be the same for all of the Columbo films ) , leaving no mystery but how Columbo solves it , making it somewhat dull(since there 's not much to look forward to at the end of the film ) . The pacing is good , there 's hardly a scene where you 're bored . The acting is very good , particularly that of Falk and Ruth Gordon . They have some great exchanges of dialog in the film . The characters are well - written and credible . The dialog and script is unusually good for a TV - movie . All in all , the film is , yes , surprisingly good for a TV - movie , and definitely worth watching for any fan of Columbo and/or crime / mystery flicks . 8/10
1 It is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book . In this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure . To see the smug grin wiped off the face of Abigail Mitchell when she realises her victim has left " deathbed testimony " which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying.<br /><br />Please understand : while I admire Ruth Gordon 's performance , her character really , * really * irritates me . She is selfish and demanding . She gets her own way by putting on a simpering ' little girl ' act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age . Worse , she has now set herself up as judge , jury and executioner against her dead niece 's husband.<br /><br />When Columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off - the - cuff speech to an audience of high - class ladies . He turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work.<br /><br />Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice . Abby 's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self - respect not to do his job well . Here is one situation you ca n't squirm out of Ms Mitchell !
1 Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made . An example of the directing : When Candy ( Jean Peters ) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing , an alarm goes off in the background in the building she 's in -- as if it 's an alarm going off in her head . It 's not cartoon - like -- it 's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you 've seen the film a few times and it just " clicks " that there 's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart - alec -- he 's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for " Moe , " the street peddler / informer , played by Thelma Ritter . Later , in her apartment , you are not seeing a movie -- you 're seeing a real person . I 've never seen anyone " act " so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter 's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat . < br /><br />About a million other things just * worked , * from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy 's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe 's hand away from her brooch , to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy 's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet , like he 's been doing it in that way in that room for many years . " Pickup On South Street " is detailed moves ( directing ) with consummate performances ( acting ) and superb now - nostalgic visuals of the day , such as the panel truck , the boards leading to the shack out on the water , the dumbwaiter , -- and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings . Wonderful stuff.<br /><br />"Pickup On South Street " is also one of the few movies where , even though the characters are n't perfect , you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape : Skip as a " three - time loser " and Candy as a youngish woman who has " knocked around " a lot . When these people behave a little more badly than you 'd expect , it 's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you 're looking in at people you 'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human .
1 In this excellent Twentieth - Century Fox film - noir , the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another . Brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism.<br /><br />A prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway . It contains a microfilm , and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it . Two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information.<br /><br />Anti - hero pickpocket Skip McCoy is played with scornful assurance by Richard Widmark . He knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors , so he taunts them : " Go on , " he says to captain Dan Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) , " drum up a charge . Throw me in . You 've done it before . " In this pitiless world , the cops are just one more gang on the streets . Just as Candy the hooker bribes Lightning Louie to get a lead , so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that when Widmark made this film he was already in early middle age . The 39-year - old star , coming to the end of his contract with Fox , plays the upstart Skip McCoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager . Today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face , but by the mores of the period it signified toughness - and Candy , after all , is a fallen woman.<br /><br />Jean Peters is radiant as Candy . Here , right in the middle of her five - year burst of B - movie fame , she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart . She is the story 's victim , a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else . She means well , but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men - Joey , Skip and the cops.<br /><br />The real star of this movie is New York . Haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living , malevolent force . Like maggots in a rotting cheese , human figures scurry through the city 's byways . Elevators , subway turnstiles , sidewalks - even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity . People cling to any niche that affords safety : Moe has her grimy rented room , Skip his tenebrous shack on the Hudson River . As the characters move and interact , they are framed by bridge architecture , or lattices of girders , or are divided by hanging winch tackle . The personality of the city is constantly imposing itself . The angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan , and the card - index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the Manhattan skyline . When Joey 's exit from the subway is barred , it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him.<br /><br />A surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close - up . Character drives the plot , as it should , and the close - ups are used to augment character . When Skip interrogates Candy , the close - up captures the sexual energy between them , belying the hostility of Skip 's words . Jean Peters ' beauty is painted in light , in exquisite soft focus close - ups . The device is also employed to heighten the tension . The opening sequence , the purse snatch , contains no dialogue : the drama relies entirely on close - up for its powerful effect.<br /><br />Snoopers , and snoopers upon snoopers , populate the film . Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) makes a living as an informant , and her place in the hierarchy is accepted , even by her victims . When Skip observes , " she 's got ta eat " , he is chanting a recurring refrain . Just as ' straight ' New Yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber , the Underworld traffics in the commodity of information.<br /><br />And yet even the stool pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends . Joey 's feet on Moe 's bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code . Joey is beyond the pale . Moe will not trade with Joey , even to preserve her life : " ... even in our crummy business , you got ta draw the line somewhere." < br /><br />"Pick - Up " was made in the depths of the Cold War . Richard Nixon had just been chosen as the Republican vice - presidential candidate , having made his name with his phoney Alger Hiss expose - bogus communist microfilm and all . The McCarthy show trials were a daily reality . We see the cops in the movie inveigh against " the traitors who gave Stalin the A - bomb".<br /><br />New York can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats , squeals and murders . Containers form a leitmotif throughout the film . Moe carries her trade mark box of ties , and candy 's purse , container of the microfilm , is the engine of the plot . Skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate , symbolising his secretive street - wisdom . The paupers ' coffins , moving down the Hudson on a barge , are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis.<br /><br />The film is a masterpiece of composition . Candy is shown above the skulking Skip on the rickety gangway of the shack , signifying her moral ascendancy . When the gun is placed on the table , the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than Candy - violence is beginning to dwarf compassion . The lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore 's hook , reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute , but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city . Enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall , or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke . He is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage - a predatory phantom of the night . Camera shots from under taxi hoods , inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis . We are civilisation 's mulch .
1 The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that I 've seen ( including Park Row , Run of the Arrow , Verboten ! , Shock Corridor , The Naked Kiss , The Big Red One , and this film ) , Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs . It represents Fuller at his most controlled . I like him when he 's out of control , of course , but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect . The film is absolutely beautiful . Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies . Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend , played by Richard Kiley . Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back . She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter . Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other , which changes Peters loyalties ( that , and the fact that she learns she 's working for communists ; the Cold War stuff is really interesting ) . The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable , but it 's not so bad that it harms the film ( unlike Fuller 's previous film , Park Row ) . Richard Widmark is great . This must be one of his best roles , but I 'm not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure . Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance . Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance , and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema . I will never forget that . 10/10 .
1 Director Samuel Fuller concocts a brilliant visual set - up : cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a woman 's purse ; it turns out she 's a courier for the Communists , and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police . The Film Noir Formula is all its glory -- before the ingredients became clichés -- including waterfront locales , floozies , saxophones on the soundtrack , and one hell of a climactic fistfight . Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target , and the smart , sharp script is quite colorful . Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a " professional stoolie " . Exciting , atmospheric , tough as nails . * * * from * * * *
1 Directed by Samuel Fuller , who also wrote the screenplay , Pickup on South Street is a tough , brutal , well made film about a pickpocket ( Richard Widmark ) who inadvertently aquires top - secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents . Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex - lover Richard Kiley . It 's film - noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie . As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties ( and who also sells information ) she is terrific in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination . Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won . This should have been the role that copped it for her !
1 I watched this last night on TV ( HBO ) . I have to admit , that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies . I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment . It was classic . Ahh yes . The dames , the villians , the cigars and thuggish cops ! It has it all . This movie delivered all the goods to me . I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot , very common for this era of movie . Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days . I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre !
1 I really enjoyed this film . All aspects of the film were top notch including the most important , for me anyway , the screenplay and the acting . This is definitely one of Richard Widmark 's strongest roles . He is totally convincing in his performance . Just out of curiosity , imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role . This is my first exposure to Jean Peter 's work that I can remember . She impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work . Thelma Ritter , in an unglamourous role , deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant . This film works on every level . The black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning . Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance . Strongly recommended , 9/10 .
1 " Pickup On South Street " is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists . The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing . The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close - ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality . Samuel Fuller 's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere.<br /><br />Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy ( Jean Peters ) on the New York subway . She was being used by her ex - boyfriend Joey ( Richard Kiley ) to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her , she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm . Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft . One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey 's apartment and the other , Zara ( Willis Bouchey ) , visits Police Captain Dan Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) . Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group.<br /><br />In order to identify the pickpocket , Tiger calls in a " stoolie " called Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) who after being given a precise description of the " cannon 's " method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects . Once Tiger sees Skip 's name on the list he 's immediately convinced that he 's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him . When Skip is brought into Tiger 's office , Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he 'll co - operate with the investigation . Skip is flippant and arrogant . He clearly does n't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway.<br /><br />Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it . Candy pays Moe for Skip 's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger , he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money . When she recovers , Skip demands payment of $ 25,000 for the microfilm . She tells Joey about Skip 's demand and Joey 's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening.<br /><br />Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it 's because of their uneasy , developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police . It soon becomes apparent , however , that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action.<br /><br />The depictions of Skip , Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling.<br /><br />Moe 's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time . She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as " an old clock running down " and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island . Her belief that " every buck has a meaning of its own " leads her to sell any information regardless of danger , friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal . Thelma Ritter 's performance certainly merited the Oscar nomination she earned for her role.<br /><br />Skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past , lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again . Despite this , he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely , is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later , he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly . Candy is an ex - hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident . Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and like Ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction .
1 Every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one . This also happened in the ' 50 's with quite a few little movies , that not a lot of people have ever heard of . There are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the ' 50 's that are worth digging out . " Panic in the Streets " is another movie like that that springs to the mind . Both are movies that are n't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie . It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed . Like all ' old ' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it 's characters you 're in for a real treat with this movie.<br /><br />The movie has a really great story that involves espionage , though the movie does n't start of like that . It begins as this typical crime - thriller with a touch of film - noir to it . But " Pickup on South Street " just is n't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on . It ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch.<br /><br />I also really liked the characters within this movie . None of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses . Really humane . It also especially features a great performance from Thelma Ritter , who even received a well deserved Oscar nomination for . It has really got to be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen.<br /><br />Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great , original , special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!<br /><br />10/10
1 Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) pick - pockets Candy 's ( Jean Peters ) wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause . She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact . However , Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone 's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey ( Richard Kiley ) and Candy who want the microfiche back . Skip can only be traced through Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) who sells information on criminals . It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film , but he intends to hold out for a high price . This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean , who has fallen in love with Skip . Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss . < br /><br />Its a well - acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away . Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark , but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey . Its a good film .
1 Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket , unable to curb his instincts back on the street , he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train . What he does n't realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm , microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations.<br /><br />Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City . Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last . Based around a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory , Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda , something that many at the time felt was over done , but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice.<br /><br />Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed , the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece , a crook and a shallow human being , his heroics are not born out of love for his country , they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak . It 's quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s , and i 'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy , all grin and icy cold heart , his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent , and is the films heart . However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours , her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters , but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majestically.<br /><br />It 's a B movie in texture but an A film in execution , Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director . 9/10
1 Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America 's great directors . I 'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood 's great craftsmen . But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood 's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music . During the time he worked for Hollywood studios , he knew how to take an assignment , shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts ... on time and on budget . Pickup on South Street is a case in point . On the surface it 's one more of Hollywood 's early Fifties ' anti - Commie movies , complete with appeals to patriotism , a hard - boiled hero and a slimy ( and copiously perspiring ) bad guy . Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut , exciting drama with any number of off - kilter twists . The hero , Skip McCoy , is a three - time loser , a petty crook with soft fingers who does n't change his stripes until the very end . The girl in the caper , Candy , has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you 're so inclined . One of the most appealing characters , Moe Williams , is a stoolie . And in an unusual approach to Hollywood 's battle against Commies , the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears ; the hero is n't motivated by anything so ennobling . He just wants payback for a personal reason , and winds up becoming ... at least for now ... a good guy . < br /><br />Plus , all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio . He had to make do . Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star , but Jean Peters is a surprise . She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb , and no better than her boy friends ... or her clients ... want her to be . And Richard Kiley , who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway , is convincingly slippery and cowardly . It 's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us , I mean introduced to us , " The Impossible Dream " from Man of La Mancha , < br /><br />More than anything else , this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash , pursued by the Feds and the Commies , moves straight ahead with great economy . The whole enterprise , with a classic noir look , only takes 80 minutes to tell . The dialogue , with Fuller as screenwriter , has that party corny , partly pungent hard - boiled pulp fiction style . " That muffin you grifted ... she 's okay , " one character says to Skip about Candy . Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next . Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams . All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest , part comedy relief and part sad inevitability . < br /><br />The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller 's talents and strengths . In 2 minutes and 15 seconds , starting right after the credits , Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie , to establish for us what the story is about , and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- we 're going to be involved with . And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot , packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us . < br /><br />Says Glenn Erickson , in my opinion one of the best of movie critics , " In what should be an inconsequential story , Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up : stiff - necked , aggressive self - interest that when fully expressed recognizes what 's wrong and what 's right and is n't afraid to fight for it . As always in his work , the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort . " He 's right , and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years .
1 and anyone who watches this film will agree . This film was directed in the days when plot , character believability and theme actually mattered.<br /><br />Jean Peters , Widmark , and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight . Ritter is in top form as informer " Moe " she survives in the Bowery section of NY , acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police.<br /><br />The only other film in which I have seen Peters is " Niagara " , and she certainly proves her acting ability here , complete with Brooklyn accent . Widmark is appropriately menacing , as the anti - hero who must discern what the right thing is , despite his need for cash.<br /><br />The photography is brilliant . The neon , the subway station ( though it looks cleaner than the real thing ! ) the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient . Excellent use is made of the city , with " Lightning Louie " in Chinatown ; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here ; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop . 10/10 .
1 This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s . This minimalist and fast - working director has something unusual for his earlier films -- a cast with some stars . Richard Widmark , Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America -- and they 'll stop at nothing to succeed.<br /><br />The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents . They know she is a link in a long espionage chain . Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation -- a small - time pickpocket ( Widmark ) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying . Widmark thinks it 's just another purse he 's ransacked -- only later does he realize the seriousness of what he 's stolen . Now it 's Widmark on his own -- with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail.<br /><br />Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish . Although she did n't get top billing , a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter . This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon . Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady.<br /><br />As far as the script and directing go , they are very good -- but with one small exception . At first , I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted . It 's one of the few times on film you 'll see a woman punched square in the mouth ! Now THAT 'S tough . Later , inexplicably , they become amazingly close -- too close to be believable . Still , with so much great drama and such an effective Noir - like film , this can be overlooked . See this film .
1 Sam Fuller 's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50 's Cold War - influenced low - budget noir vehicles . With a running length of under 80 minutes , PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough , gritty , explosive and endlessly entertaining.<br /><br />Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy , who has already been picked up three times . Yet McCoy ca n't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster 's moll Candy ( Jean Peters ) . Candy 's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement , and it 's her last job for ex - boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery . However , when Widmark lifts it , Peters must do whatever it takes to re - claim the film she ( initially ) knows nothing about.<br /><br />It 's a tasty set - up , with Widmark 's character , while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH , a real live - wire , unpredictable and tough , yet curiously charming . When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get : a lone anti - hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end ( Bogart ) , or an overly - laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap ( Mitchum ) . With Widmark you just do n't know what you are going to get , and with his incredibly modern acting style ( his films always hold up well ) he is amazing to watch . Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film , or handing it over to the police and fighting the " Commies " on the right side of the law . And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.<br /><br />Peters gets her best role as the moll - with - a - heart - of - gold Candy . Widmark 's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters ; the gorgeous tramp quickly ( and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed)falls under Widmark 's spell , yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around . Peters hard - edged beauty , yet lack of over - lacquered Hollywood glamour ( Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role ) , is a major asset to the film . Candy is not innocent , yet she 's very vulnerable , constantly being passed between and slapped around by men . Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face , yet by the final act he 's a lot more tender to her ( after she cops one hell of a going - over from Kiley ) . The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark should n't work , but it does.<br /><br />Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe , well - deserving of her Oscar nomination . Ritter 's performance , like everything else in the film , is gritty , real and heartbreakingly honest . Her death scene is stunning . Fuller 's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting . Fuller loved a good close - up , and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable , cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot . Fuller is n't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old - Hollywood really allowed , yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter 's death scene to give the audience maximum impact . The urban locales and unusual , confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET , a bold , uncompromisingly modern look.<br /><br />10/10 .
1 Pickup on South Street ( 1953 ) , directed by movie maverick Samuel Fuller , contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication . Subway rider Candy ( Susan Peters ) collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool ) . She 's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm ; McCoy is unaware of grifting it . Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents . Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges . Candy is doubly watched ( Skip and the police ) and therefore doubly naive ; Skip , the overconfident petty thief , is singularly unaware , trailed by federal agents ; the feds , all knowing , are ultimately helpless . They ca n't stop the " passing " of government secrets or the spread of communism .
1 Samuel Fuller 's Pickup on South Street is anomalous : A " Red Scare " movie devoid of hysteria , in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot . Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm ; unbeknownst to either of them , it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War . Peters , as it happens , was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who 's running her , cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley . In trying to retrieve the precious film , both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter , a streetwise old jane who 's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears.<br /><br />Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story , which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality . From the subways to the waterfront , his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that 's almost pungent . The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender , and they 're scored to " Again , " a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House , also starring Widmark . The pace slackens for Ritter 's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir , and a kind of mirage - oasis in a film parched of sentimentality . This is writer / director Fuller 's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle ; his later explorations of American pathology ( The Crimson Kimono , The Naked Kiss , Underworld U.S.A. ) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street .
1 The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive . It 's too much for my budget at the moment , or I would purchase it , because the film is a good example of film noir ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark , Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much . That 's the case here for an 80-minute black - and - white , mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary , cinematography - wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here ( as opposed to visuals , actors , sound , sets , etc . ) as a pickpocket ( Widmark ) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters ' purse . ( say that three times ! ) . Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie : Widmark , the cops , the U.S. agents and the Communists and , especially Ritter as " Moe , " an informant . She and Widmark are the stars of this film.<br /><br />Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by " falling in love " with Widmark on the first meeting even though he 's nasty to her . Only in world of film ! ! Too bad , because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.<br /><br />This an average film noir which means good , but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25-$35 . For that price , one could do a lot better in the film noir market .
1 From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work ( RICHARD WIDMARK ) stealing from a woman 's purse ( JEAN PETERS ) , PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch . Partly it 's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast , the B&W photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters , and because Samuel Fuller 's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John ( ASPHALT JUNGLE ) Huston . In fact , it has the same urgency as the Huston film about a heist that goes wrong -- but the payoff is not quite as strong.<br /><br />JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard - edged girl whom Widmark describes as being " knocked around a lot " . She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro - film in her purse for her boyfriend ( RICHARD KILEY ) , something the FBI already knows about . They 're on her trail when the theft occurs.<br /><br />THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called " Moe " who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life . She 's particularly touching in her final scene with Kiley.<br /><br />This one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time . Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark , Peters and Ritter .
1 ' Shock Corridor ( 1963 ) ' was my first film from Samuel Fuller , and there I was impressed with the director 's astute blending of B - movie and big - budget aesthetics , even if the story itself was pure schlock . ' Pickup on South Street ( 1953 ) ' was released a decade earlier in Fuller 's career , obviously produced on a larger budget from a big - name studio , Twentieth Century - Fox . Nevertheless , the visuals are still notable in that there 's a somewhat raw , naturalistic element to the photography , not unlike Dassin 's ' The Night and the City ( 1950 ) ' and Kazan 's ' Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) ' { the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald}. In some scenes , Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors ' faces that they 're out of focus , bluntly registering the intimate thoughts , emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features , the eye . Though ( unexpectedly ) prone to melodrama , and with just a hint of anti - Communist propaganda , ' Pickup on South Street ' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City.<br /><br />When just - out - of - prison pickpocket Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) snags the purse of a woman on the subway ( Jean Peters ) , he pockets more than he 'd originally bargained for . The woman , Candy , and her cowardly ex - boyfriend Joey ( Richard Kiley ) had been smuggling top - secret information to the Communists , and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro - film . Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities , or sell it to the highest bidder ? If ' Pickup on South Street ' has a flaw , it 's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti - Communist agenda , reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII { Dwight Taylor , who supplied the story , also notably wrote ' The Thin Man Goes Home ( 1944 ) , ' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. For no apparent reason , every identifiable character  even the smugly self - serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self - sacrificing patriot , the transformation predictable from the outset . In traditional film noir , the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance , the rational punishment for his sins , but apparently not when they 've served their country ; patriotism wipes the slate clean.<br /><br />Richard Widmark , an actor who I 'm really beginning to like , plays the haughty pickpocket with composure , though always with that hint of ill - ease that suggests he 's biting off more than he can chew . The opening scene on the train is the film 's finest , as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim 's hand bag , recalling Bresson 's ' Pickpocket ( 1959 ) . ' Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street - woman who 'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it ( though , of course , she draws the line at Commies ) . Jean Peters is well - cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side , playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour ; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow - legged strut of a prostitute . Nevertheless , Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film 's attempts at realism . Fascinatingly , upon its release , ' Pickup on South Street ' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI , and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite . Go figure .
1 This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir , though changes the context from post - war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity . In " Pickup on South Street " , policemen are good guys , criminals are genuine guys , and the only enemies are " The Commies " , who are ultimately differentiated from the good - guys in that they are emotionally personable , driven by an actual care for their own worth , as shown in the constant tracked - in close - ups that speckle the movie.<br /><br />This movie revolves around characters . The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed : Skip the pick - pocket who is able to stare down any danger , and sometimes while going through their personal possessions ; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral , but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters ( and the audience ) ; Candy , the ill - named innocent girl who only thinks she 's doing government work and does n't fully comprehend the conspiracy she 's involved with ; and Joey , the ex - boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and , ironically , is the worst person at doing it . Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters ( such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen ) and " Pickup on South Street " treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
1 This film is a spicy little piece of film - making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best , most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy , a small - time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy 's ( Jean Peters ) pocket on a crowded bus . It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ( ex?)boyfriend , who 's working for the " commies".<br /><br />Superficially , there 's a mystery here regarding Candy 's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives  . Actually he seems to just initially assume that she 's a " commie " , going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture . But the real question is  what 's going on with Skip ? What are his motives , and why does Candy like him so much ? Why do we ( the audience ) want to like him so much ? Basically what the film - makers have done here is create a very striking " male fatale " in Widmark 's character and his performance . Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like " The Big Sleep " or " The Glass Key " along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face , the film - makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers . Widmark is handsome , and there 's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady , he robs her and then punches her in the face . Eventually the question becomes  would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck ( his comments to the police , like " you 're waving a flag at ME ? " make us suspect he would ) or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) ? I 'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way.<br /><br />Thelma Ritter 's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here . Fuller is n't afraid to give her plenty of " business "  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world , particularly her used ties . Another example of Fuller 's " business " would be the scene with Victor Perry ( an actor I 've seen elsewhere used to less effect ) using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy.<br /><br />The emphasis on Moe 's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema 's most revealing " honor among thieves " themes . In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police , with the notable exception of Capt . Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) who has a grudge against him . I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack . Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is " realistic " or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions.<br /><br />All told , I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the " film noir " school of film - making . A predictable plot is off - set by a host of colorful characters ( uniformly well - performed ) , cheap sets are disguised by the film 's unrelenting pace , and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is . This is the best film I 've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he 's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like " The Crimson Kimono " and " Shock Corridor " as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense . This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I 've seen so far  and Widmark was a talent that I 'm tempted to say ( based on the few extraordinary films I 've seen with him ) was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart , although arguably he did n't make as many classic films .
1 Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy , pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema.<br /><br />Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy ( a role he perfected over the course of many movies ) , who snatches a young lady 's ( Jean Peters ) wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much - wanted microfilm . This is 1953 , so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back . When the girl shows up at Widmark 's waterfront shack , sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film , Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her " comrades " down for big money . The plot thickens , people start dying , and Widmark and Peters fall in love.<br /><br />Fuller handles the love story clumsily , but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction . It 's as if he included a love story under duress , and so made it intentionally unbelievable , as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films . Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie , part gangster moll and part damsel in distress . When violence occurs against her , we genuinely care about her well being , and it 's typical of Fuller 's renegade , ahead - of - his - time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion.<br /><br />But the ultimate success of " Pickup on South Street " rests squarely on the world - weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter , who plays Moe , a feisty lady who makes money any way she can , whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant . Ritter gives the performance of her career ; in a breathtaking monologue , she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character 's life , and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle , crime and hardship . It 's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they were n't given a chance to vent in those other movies . The scene is the highlight of Fuller 's film , and a highlight of 50s cinema , period.<br /><br />Grade : A+
1 Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult following , particularly in Europe . Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable . He did however direct one really terrific movie in " Pickup on South Street " . Made pretty early on in his career , the movies that followed were vastly inferior.<br /><br />From the first to the last frame , " Pickup " works on all levels . It 's filmed with flawless fluidity , boasting fine performances all round . Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances , are at their peak . Widmark , who was no stranger at playing villains , while truly mean to the core , still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters character 's falling for him all the more credible.<br /><br />Fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie . There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark . It 's truly shocking in its reality . This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography.<br /><br />Less self conscious than many film noir 's of the period this remains a great example of the genre .
1 In what will probably find itself on my list of Fuller 's best movies ( that is , once I see more of them that just this and Shock Corridor ) , Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatale , as well as the male protagonist , are not the stereotypical ones in the genre . Like most of his other works , Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually absent in the Hollywood noirs . On a small budget- at least for the likes of Darryl F. Zanuck- Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere . The good guys are basically the ones who wo n't get violent with you even as they 're looking for an extra buck . < br /><br />Richard Widmark , Jean Peters , and Thelma Ritter are all terrific in the lead parts . Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could 've really pulled off this character . He 's a little like Bugs Bunny , as he can be a wise - ass who is a little sneaky . On the other hand , the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values in his life . He does n't go into other people 's affairs , and does n't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river , after being sent away for three years . He slips up , unbeknownst to him , when he pickpockets a woman ( Peters ) on the train , and lifts an item that 's under the eye of the Government . It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money . But at what cost is the centerpiece of the film , as it involves stoolie Moe ( Ritter is one of the finest , and most believable , character actors from the period ) , the woman 's ex ( a volatile Kiley ) , and the police department.<br /><br />Aside from the thematic elements , which are told with a keen dramatic , journalistic style ( as was Fuller 's previous position , along with boxer ) , the dialog is fresh and involving . There 's a spontaneity in many of Fuller 's camera moves . And what a third act . This is a lean , tight film - noir that is worth checking out even if you 're not familiar with Fuller ( it 's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works ) .
1 This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work , and its sad that he could n't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studios to do his stuff . The story line goes something like this . A tough hard broad ( read prostitute ) is riding the subway one hot summer day , and gets her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy . What Skip ( and the dame ) do n't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies . This opening shot without dialogue , and mostly in tight close - ups is a beaut , one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the movie . Playing the babe known as Candy is Jean Peters , who was never better nor better looking . One forgets how beautiful she was , and she handles this role very well . The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark , who had already made his mark , and set his style with 1947 's Kiss Of Death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh , and although he 's a little " softer " here , he 's still scary . These hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there , but its noir and nasty all the way . The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter , who plays Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral . Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance , but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B girl ( read prostitute ) in " From Here To Eternity . " Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad , and loves to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful . See for instance Shirley Jones in " Elmer Gantry . Set among the docks and dives of New York City , with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald , and some very good art direction . Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark 's shack near the river . Made at the height of the cold war and red scare , the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie , played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American .
1 Thelma Ritter did steal the picture . I just finished watching it again . I could n't help becoming emotional in her final scene . She did n't get the Oscar . That 's why you should n't put too much faith in Oscars . Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-D , flawed human being . Jean Peters was great as the streetwise , tough girl in her best role ever . And Richard Kiley must have been very good ; why else would I have hated him so . Yes , it was heavy handed on the patriotism ; but , without it , you do n't have much of a film . Watch their faces ! The top three stars did n't really need much script . I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue . If you 've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in " The Thief " , maybe you know what I mean . When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC , I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No . 66 . That 's when I knew that Hollywood could n't be trusted . But I did find the river.<br /><br />I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself . If you have seen it , no elucidation is necessary . Just maybe , someone who is reading these comments has n't seen " Pickup On South Street " . You will like it ; just do n't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City .
1 Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie . He is a professional pickpocket . He 's been in prison three times , yet at the beginning of the film , he tries to make it four . Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody . Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark.<br /><br />This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely . What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films . This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film.<br /><br />The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater . The sets show it is a limited budget film . The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift . Hoover wanted it changed.<br /><br />Instead , it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953 . The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year .
1 Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker , mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films . While " Shock Corridor " and " The Naked Kiss " represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and " The Big Red One " was an effective portrait of the horrors of war , " Merrill 's Marauders " painted war as necessary hell and " Pickup on South Street " is about the dangers of communist spies . All of his films make for very entertaining viewing , and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b - filmmaker , Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors . " Pickup on South Street " is no exception , and despite the dated themes , the film - making style is remarkably ahead of its time . Its also a very quickly - pace , tight , and occasionally brutal film noir.<br /><br />The acting across the board is fantastic . Richard Widmark makes for a great anti - hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend . The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however , in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie . The angles Fuller employs are great , making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal ( this is very violent for its time ) . The camera continuously moves around just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later . " Pickup on South Street " is a great action - paced noir thriller . " Shock Corridor " remains my favorite Fuller film , but this is a very close second . ( 8/10 )
1 This is a pretty decent example of film noir . The setting is the early 50 's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples . He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A - List about him . The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti - hero but through most of the film , an unlikeable anti - hero . That is not very normal . Jean Peters gave a so - so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold . That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool - pigeon.<br /><br />The plot had its fair share of twists and turns , wisecracks and tough talk . There is a fight scene near the end of the movie ( in the subway station ) that was pretty gritty and exciting.<br /><br />I think noir fans ( like myself ) will enjoy this film . For non - noir viewers , it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone .
1 I watched this flick yesterday and I have to say it 's the finest horror film made for $ 36,000 I 've ever seen ( Sorry Steckler ) The film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan . This movie reeks of soul and atmosphere . Some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film . VERY creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims . Brrrrrrr.<br /><br />Hot saggy Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the HORROR rears its undead corpse eating head . This film entertained from start to finish . I could n't ask for more than that . My only complaint is that is was too short .
1 This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing , little to no continuity , insane dialog , bad ( you might even say non - existent ) acting , pointless story lines , shots that go on FAR too long ... and it 's perfect for MST3K - style riffing , not to mention the " Corpse Eaters Drinking Game " : Scribble on forms ... take a shot - Sign your name ... take a shot - Catch a bad Foley edit ... take many , many shots.<br /><br />The only reason I did n't rate it higher than 8 is because there 's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness , it 's only an hour long - hell , a movie like this should have been at least 20 - 30 minutes longer !
1 Some war movies succeed where others do not , and that can be judged from a variety of angles . The humanistic angle , one where you can feel the raw emotions ( the terror of being under attack , the camaraderie amongst soldiers , the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat , etc .. ) are always movies I find compelling . Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film.<br /><br />This film succeeds on that level as well . It speaks of " The Highest Honor " and that honor is doing the right thing . These 23 soldiers did the right thing , they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with Western thought , but it is , to the very end , a true story of honor . Unforgettable movie . Based on the true story .
1 I had seen this movie long time back , but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me.<br /><br />A wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some Japanese ships at the Singapore harbor during the height of WW2.<br /><br />These commandos are caught in plain - clothes and they are considered to be spies by the Japanese captors . But something happens that has n't been explored much in any Hollywood WW2 movie that I have seen.<br /><br />A close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives . They begin to respect each other , while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior Japanese prison guard . This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart.<br /><br />Soon , one day as the two friends are conversing , the Aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the Jap ships in the Singapore harbor.<br /><br />He mentions that it was his team and not some other 's that had sunk the ships to his Japanese friend , and upon hearing this the Japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed . But the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the Japanese authorities.<br /><br />Finally , the Japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules . This is the Highest Honor accorded to the captured warriors in Japan.<br /><br />This is the most awesome part of the film where the Aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his Aussie friend confess being guilty.<br /><br />I wo n't give away the ending here . But it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears.<br /><br />All in all , an excellent underrated movie that possibly did n't get the recognition that it deserved internationally . Get one copy today and be mesmerized .
1 I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it . The movie shows the horror of war in a way that Hollywood usually glosses over . The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside . If you can find any type of copy of this -- buy or rent it . You wo n't be disappointed , just awed .
1 It 's been so long since I 've seen this movie ( at least 15 years ) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention.<br /><br />A unit of Australian underwater demolitions experts are captured in an archipelago near Japan following a successful mission to set mines in a Japanese harbor.<br /><br />Once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other POWs but to their dismay soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured . The consequences of such an infraction , by Japanese martial code , is execution by beheading.<br /><br />Despite their pleas , and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guard , the day of reckoning approaches like a ticking time bomb . The tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking , though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad.<br /><br />The ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here . But I can promise you-- you 'll never forget it . Good luck finding the video in the U.S.
1 I was overtaken by the emotion . Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people . The performances were faultless and outstanding .
1 This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid . Since they are out of uniform , they are , justly , treated as spies . As such , they are tried , convicted , and sentenced to death . The Japanese court - martial , out of admiration for their heroism , authorizes that they be given a warrior 's death . Of course , under the code of Bushido , this means that they are to be beheaded . A fate for which , as westerners , they are unprepared .
1 This movie is a true reflection of the Australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years . Not pompous like the British , not Gung - Ho like the Americans . If either of those countries had attempted what this crew did , it would have failed dismally . Either due to ignorance on the British part , or too much faith in superior firepower on the American side . " True " Australians ( i.e. non - imports ) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives . Just look at examples like Gallipoli ; Paschendale ; Tobruk ; New Guinea and Vietnam .
1 A delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way . Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor used its full potential . A young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind . In one of the compartments he meets with a girl . Words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations . The two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words .
1 What an amazing film . With very little dialogue , the whole story is told with glances and body language . Very involving almost voyeuristic . My only gripe is that it has not been released on video in Australia and is therefore only available on TV . What a waste .
1 I always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... Well , in time I wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia . Or did that " feeling " decide to pack its bags and say " goodbye " somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history , and then never came back ? Or did it ? Because for me , it came back the first time I saw " Ekspres , Ekspres " . And it was it 's old self again.<br /><br />There are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story , the warmth of the colors and , what I appreciated the most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication ( something many of other ( not just ) Slovenian screenwriters should at least consider ) . There is no use for words , when you can understand each other just as well ( yeah , or better ) by other means in use . Just watch Bakovic and Cerar . Uh.<br /><br />So this , in only so many words , is why I would recommend " Ekspres , Ekspres " to all of you , as a must - see Slovenian movie , regardless of what you may heard of Slovenian films ( if you ever even heard anything , that is ... ).<br /><br />Oh , and that scene , where Bakovic is dancing to Vivaldi 's music ... A treat.<br /><br />Treat yourself . Watch it .
1 ... when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary.<br /><br />Although few lines , it was kind of weird to see this movie , no subs , in a language unknown . A friend of mine sent a VHS , included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to English . with her translation next to me , I began watching this tale ( it is indeed a tale ) , and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits I was stuck . the colours , that minimal acting ( well , in most cases ) , absurd comedy , slapstick , thoughtful , beautiful ... along with a few other movies ( Paris , Texas and Nenette et Boni ) , this one is able to speak to anyone 's heart - without words . Whenever you get the chance , see it . Whatever you do - do n't miss it . It 's a once in a lifetime experience . Oh , acting is great , the soundtrack is brilliant , the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely ( never ? ) like this .
1 A kind of road movie in old - fashioned trains in the Slowenian late summer province . At the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth , and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases , you see that the trousers - part is missing on a flag of mourning ( appearently his father has died ) . In the train he meets a young lady , and almost without words , but many small gestures , a wonderful love story begins . It 's a somehow surreal , very poetic , and a little bizarre movie , with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents . Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details .
1 Go , Igor , go , you are the proof that Slovenian films may , should and must be different . There 's soul in it , and this is rare . Do n't let anybody put you down !
1 I ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a Sunday afternoon . Though it was obviously a cheesy TV movie from the 70s , the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention , and indeed I was hooked and had to watch it through to the end . I recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign DVD of this film ( oops , did n't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior ) , and was very pleased to be able to watch it again ( and in its entirety).<br /><br />I do n't wholly understand the phenomenon , but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary . The decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons , but are they actually scary ? No , not very . Likewise in the years since the 70s we 've gotten horror movies that are cooler , more exciting , have much better production values and sophisticated special effects , are more fun , funnier , have effective " jump " moments , and some very creative uses of gore , but again ... they are n't really scary ! There 's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films . The grainy film quality . The spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high - tech lighting rigs . The " edge of dreamland " muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently EQ'd scores . The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything . Everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s , in the case of horror , works in its favor.<br /><br />Specifically , in this film , the quiet , intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving . So much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling , slavering , and overtly hostile ( " Cujo " ? ) . The filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full - on supernatural form . The effects when that occurs , while unsophisticated by today 's standards , literally gave me chills . The bizarre , vaguely - defined , " I 'm not quite sure what I 'm looking at " look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be , rather than the hyper - real , crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter - day horror films.<br /><br />While the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit , the actors all do a decent job . The pairing of the brother and sister from the " Witch Mountain " movies as , yes , brother and sister , is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting , but they do fine . Yvette Mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular . Richard Crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses . His self - doubt as he wonders whether his family 's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he 's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled , though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he 's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté.<br /><br />The movie 's The - End - Question - Mark type ending is one of the only ones I 've seen that does n't feel like a cheap gimmick , and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they 'd be likely to do and how they 'd feel about it.<br /><br />Detractors of this film may say it 's merely a feature - length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots , but hey , you could say the same thing about " Blade Runner " . :-)
1 I 've seen this movie more than once . It was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then . The only problem I had was with the title for the obvious reasons ... One immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by Drake 's ! Leaving off the first part , ' Hound of Hell ' would have sufficed.<br /><br />Richard Crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does , anyway - whether the plot is good or bad . But this was an enjoyable Halloween fare offered by the CBS network . I loved the part where Crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast . He asks the cab driver how to find this guy . Great dialogue between the native cab driver and Crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people 's ethnic beliefs . ' Aw , Mr. Barry , I left that stuff behind when I came down from the mountains ... ' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people , and nobody knows how to really contact him . < br /><br />As far as supernatural fare goes , this movie is still enjoyable .
1 Yes it was a little low budget , but this movie shows love ! The only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to " Waterworld " and though the plot was good , the film never really tapped into it 's full potential ! Strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night .
1 Not only does this film have one of the great movie titles , it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards . I seem to remember this film being broadcast Halloween week back in ' 78 going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House . I missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film . Later , on repeat , I saw I made the right choice . The movie is not really bad , but , really lacks any chills or surprises . Although , I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail .
1 The Devil Dog : Hound of Hell is really good film . It has good acting by the cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong . The music is spooky and gives that devilish chill!I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns , frill like part on his neck , and acted really viscous!If you like horror films and have n't seen The Devil Dog : Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and I do n't think you 'll be disappointed !
1 Before Cujo , there was Lucky the devil dog . In 1978,on Halloween night the movie"Devil Dog , The Hound of Hell " premiered . A story of a family getting a new puppy ( from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables ) because their dog Skipper was killed . Coencidence ? Everyone loves the new dog , but there is something strange about him . < br /><br />It is n't long until the father Mike Barry(Richard Crenna , First Blood)starts to notice . His wife Betty(Yvette Mimieux , Where The Boys Are , Jackson County Jail , Snowbeast)is different and his kids Charlie and Bonnie(Ike Eisenman , Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards , Witch Mountain , Nanny and the Professor , Hello Larry , Tuff - Turf)also have changed . Does the dog have something to do with it ? He 's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family.<br /><br />This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies . This is one of the many 70 's made - for - TV horror movies that was actually scary for a made - for - TV horror movie . The music was creepy and even the ending which I wo n't tell made you think.<br /><br />This movie also stars Ken Kercheval(Cliff Barnes of Dallas)and R.G. Armstrong(who could n't stay away from devil movies remember"Race with the Devil"?)<br /><br />It 's worth watching .
1 No , this hilariously horrible 70 's made - for - TV horror clinker is n't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake . Still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute , unremitting silliness and atrociousness that 's quite tasty in a so - execrable - it's - downright - awesome sort of way . Richard Crenna , looking haggard and possibly inebriated , and Yvette Mimieux , who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in " Jackson County Jail , " sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann ( the psychic alien moppets from the Disney " Witch Mountain " pictures ) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . Boy , now does n't that sound really scary and disturbing ? Well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ai n't , but it sure is funny , thanks to Curtis ( " Night Tide " ) Harrington 's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish ( not so ) special effects , an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot , and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story ( besides the leads , both Martine Beswicke and R.G. Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman ) . Favorite scene : the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade . While stuck - up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo .
1 Those childhood memories ... when things were new , and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us ; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.<br /><br />One of the initial memories I have from childhood is this animated program " Galaxy Express 999 , " about a young boy named Tetsuro , who goes on a train ride around the galaxy , in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold - hearted , trophy gathering mechanical hunters . Accompanying Tetsuro on his journey is Maetel , a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago ... <br /><br />Back in the early-80 's , as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in Seoul , South Korea , " Galaxy Express 999 " was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from Japan , which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them . The memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9 pm before bed time ... <br /><br />Those were some wonderful memories , never to be had again ... <br /><br />As I moved to America , and while residing here for over 2 decades , I sometimes wondered about that time and place , in a country thousands of miles away divided from America by an enormously vast ocean , of this childhood program , with its hit theme song , and of the boy named Tetsuro , his protective companion Maetel , the enigmatic train conductor , and of the spacefaring train Galaxy Express 999.<br /><br />Many , many years passed ... <br /><br />Last summer while I was in Korea , I was able to track down a copy of the original " Galaxy Express 999 " ( 1979 ) on DVD , and it brought back a lot of nostalgic , heartfelt memories . " Galaxy Express 999 " remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago , opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries , an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life 's journey into manhood.<br /><br />Here 's to wonderful memories . " Good - bye , Maetel . Good - bye , Galaxy Express 999 ... <br /><br />Good - bye , to my childhood." < br /><br />10/10
1 I saw this as a child in the late eighties and I must say , Galaxy Express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time . If you 've never understood the appeal of anime , discovering this film may be your golden ticket to Otaku - town.<br /><br />The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner . The cell animation , while somewhat traditional , possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays Leiji Matsumoto 's great talent for character design and visual storytelling.<br /><br />This is one of those unique children 's films like Star Wars , The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz that completely transcends ' family entertainment ' status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film .
1 Yeah , it is . In fact , it 's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies . Number 15 , I think . Anyways , I 'm usually not one for plots , but I think plots work better in anime and RPG video games , ( Final Fantasy 7 , for example ) and not movies . But this one has it all . Vivid drawings of planets , stars , an extremely well written screenplay . While this is not really for children , they can still watch it , it contains no graphic blood , guts and silicone . But I do n't think they 're going to understand it .
1 Galaxy Express 999 ( Ginga tetsudô Three - Nine ) . Made in 1979 . Directed by Rintaro . Based on the original work by Leiji Matsumoto.<br /><br />What little I know of the history of GALAXY EXPRESS 999 , it was first published as a popular manga in 1970 's and was created by Leiji Matsumoto . GE999 is set in the same Star Wars - type of space universe as Matsumoto 's other famous space manga : CAPTAIN HARLOCK . In fact space pirate Harlock and other characters from that manga ( including Queen Emeraldas and Tochirô Oyama ) make appearances in GE999 . GE999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes . It was aired in 1978 . A year later came this anime film , which is n't a sequel to the series , but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie . < br /><br />The story is set in unidentified Star Wars - type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility . People of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years , maybe even forever . The protagonist , Tetsurô Hoshino , is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel Count Mecha , whose entire body is made of mechanical parts , kills Tetsurô 's mother . Tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body . To obtain it he must travel to a far - away planet with space train Galaxy Express 999 . However , since Tetsurô comes from poverty , he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket . By a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman , Maetel , who bears a resemblance to his dead mother . Maetel offers a ticket for Tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey . And so the journey begins  < br /><br />I first saw this film last October , about six months from now , and again yesterday . I feel that I must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film : it seems very rushed . Then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series ? Whatever the case , the situations change with a fast speed and Tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance . I feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes . < br /><br />However , there 's no arguing that GE999 has deserved its place as an anime classic . The animation itself , very faithful to the style of Matsumoto 's manga , is detailed and beautiful to watch . Even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become " out of date " but puts many later anime films in shame . The music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat " old " these day ( it was the 70 's after all ) . I have not heard any English dub of this film so I can only comment the Japanese audio which is good . Voice actors give life to their characters , most memorable ones being Masako Nozawa ( mainly known as the voice of Goku through out the entire Dragon Ball saga ) as the excited and young Tetsurô , and Masako Ikeda as the calm and mysterious Maetel . The supporting characters are not left in shadows , but also have a life of their own , most memorable to me being waitress Claire . < br /><br />The story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours , as well as for those who try to find deeper messages . GE999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as Tetsurô 's journey from boyhood to manhood . The whole film is told from his point of view , so we are forced to feel what he feels . I think many people can relate to Tetsurô , for despite the fantasy elements , he is a very realistic character : young , hot headed , awkward and naive . We follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not . Maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end , when she reveals who and what she really is , it does n't much answer to anything . Maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man , always close but just out of reach . < br /><br />It 's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between Tetsurô and Maetel that still awakes talking and questions , and fascinates after the decades . People have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends , of mother and son , or of two possible lovers ( which wakes a lot of critique since Maetel 's age is unknown and Tetsurô has n't even reached his puberty yet ) . Without any means to sound deep , I think the best term to describe them is " soul mates " . There is no question that the two feel devotion , caring and love for each others , yet it goes beyond that of friendship , family and lovers . I think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories , it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters . The ending scene , even if you already know what is going to happen , is still very touching and memorable.<br /><br />All in all , despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes , GALAXY EXPRESS 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like Katsuhiro Otomo 's AKIRA ( 1988 ) and Mamoru Oshii 's GHOST IN THE SHELL ( 1995 ) . The film is directed by Rintaro , who had previous experience of Leiji Matsumoto 's works as he had worked in CAPTAIN HARLOCK series . Later Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS ( 2001 ) that also questions the difference between humans and machines . < br /><br />GALAXY EXPRESS 999 ( 1979 ) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan .
1 One word can describe this movie and that is weird . I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting . Well it was , the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge . On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not . Very strange , if you are a fan of animation / science - fiction you might want to check this out .
1 Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie . This is a fine movie that tells about Tetsuro 's quest to avenge his mother 's death , but also grows up in the process . The journey on the train sort of represents Tetsuro 's journey from boyhood to manhood . The music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated ( you can tell it 's a 70 's movie ) and the animation is only slightly better than your average " Star Blazers " episode . But the story and the characters are so strong , it really does n't matter . A must - see for any animation fan !
1 What can I say ? An action and allegorical tale which has just about everything . Basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world ..... and more . He meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains , and has quite a time telling them apart . A definite must - see .
1 This early Anime movie was a rather good film that I caught once on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network . I quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet . This film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie , though I would rather watch the original Japanese version . Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed . This film features a young boy who boards a train called the Galaxy Express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot . He wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother , who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun . During the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother , a beautiful woman named Matel , who as with most woman in Anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero , or really bad . He goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series , so basically the Galaxy Express takes place in that universe . All in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending . There would be a sequel to this one , but it was not quite as good as this one , however the ending was a bit more final than it was here .
1 I 've watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered ( especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race , but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting I 've seen from the house of Bruckheimer . The casting , especially of the younger officers , was spot on , and the script and editing , the soundtrack , and the acting made this episode a tour d'force . If I were the producers I would submit this episode for Emmy consideration . It amazing how complete a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode ; that takes a lot of talented people doing their best . I hope there 's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated , because I 'm sure I 'll notice a lot that I did not notice the first time around .
1 What a stunning episode for this fine series . This is television excellence at its best . The story takes place in 1968 and it 's beautifully filmed in black & white , almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images . This is a story about two men who fall in love , but I do n't want to spoil this . It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America . Written by the superb Tom Pettit , and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc , we move through their lives , their love for each other , and their tragedy . Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning . Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters . Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan 's gorgeous , " Ah , but I was so much older then , I 'm younger than that now , " as sung by the Byrds . This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars . Beautiful .
1 This was one of the all time best episodes . Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in ' 68 . A dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting . His case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman.<br /><br />Further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love . This type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time.<br /><br />While this is n't the type of love I personally support , he was still a policeman and a human being and should n't have been killed for it . The sound track was excellent ( keeps me watching the DVR ) , and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing . I shall be watching this one in repeat !
1 this was a fantastic episode . i saw a clip from it on YouTube , and i vowed that should it ever show on TV , i would glue myself to the set in order to watch . i wound up watching it with a friend of mine , who happens to be gay , and the two of us cried at the end . this was a truly well - written , heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who , i felt , really were ( in Coop 's words ) " the Lucky Ones " . it is episodes like this one that really make Cold Case one of the most captivating and much - loved works of television magic on CBS . i anxiously await more episodes , and a re - run of " Forever Blue " because i will always watch it again and again .
1 I have watched quite a few Cold Case episodes over the years , beginning with Season 1 episodes back in 2003 - 2004 . And while most have been good , this particular episode was not only the best of the best , but has few rivals in the Emmy categories . Though some may not agree with the story content ( i.e. the male - to - male romantic relationship ) , I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit.<br /><br />The story is essentially about a case that was reopened , based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer . The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960 's named Sean Coop ( aka , the cold case victim who goes by his last name , Coop ) and his partner , Jimmy Bruno . < br /><br />In the story , Coop is single , a Vietnam war vet , with a deeply troubled past . Jimmy , however , is married , with children no less . Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship , but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time.<br /><br />The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white , with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout . Examples include their red squad car , the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in Jimmy 's bedroom , where Jimmy 's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink , fight , and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol - induced state . I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes , with everything else in black and white . I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale.<br /><br />The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode . One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy 's baby . In this scene , Coop 's father , Sarge , who was a respected fellow officer on the force , confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop 's relationship with Jimmy . One can feel sorry for Coop , at this point , as the shame and disgrace of Coop 's father was heaped upon Coop - " You are not going to disgrace our family ... and you 're not my son , either . " - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same - sex relationships of that era.<br /><br />Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go at it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled " Batman and Robin homos " . < br /><br />As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy , it 's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life . Once can see the tension in Jimmy 's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids , his church , and yet his undying devotion to Coop.<br /><br />In the end , Jimmy walks away from Coop , realizing that he can not have both Coop and his family at the same time . Sadly , Coop is killed , perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy , but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force.<br /><br />The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop , as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car , quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner : " Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones . Do n't forget that." < br /><br />The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode . I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett , playing the still grieving Jimmy , only much older by now , and clearly still missing his former partner , Coop.<br /><br />I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best . It is without a doubt the most well - written , well - acted , and well done of all Cold Case episodes that I 've ever seen .
1 A convict serving time comes forward to give the Cold Case unit information about the murder of a policeman , committed years before . The murder of Sean Cooper , a good cop , was never solved . Naturally , the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues.<br /><br />In flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of James Bruno 's baby . Sean and Jimmy were partners . There is tension as Sean , who is the godfather , arrives disheveled and late for the rite . Eileen Bruno does n't appear to be happy being there . The real mystery is revealed by her . She caught Sean , who was drinking with Jimmy in the backyard , kiss her husband , and more shocking yet , Jimmy responding willingly.<br /><br />Somehow at the station the partners become the center of gossip . Sean has not endeared himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business . Sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags Sean and Jimmy haul into the station all the time . The pressure is too much on Jimmy . Sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it . Cooper 's own father does n't want anything to do with a queer son . Even his superior McCree wants him out of his jurisdiction , but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force . Sean is killed because his homosexual condition , and for knowing too much on his peers ' involvement in taking dirty money.<br /><br />Tom Petit wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop . We thought it was a frank account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days . Sometimes the people involved with the show , fearing reprisals from sponsors , or the networks , do n't dare to present these real situations . Jeannot Szwarc , shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue , which is dealt without the sensationalism the case might have been shown with a different team.<br /><br />There is a rare Chad Everett appearance as the older Jimmy Bruno . His take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that does n't get out of hand . Shane Johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper . The cast is marvelous and it includes good all around performances from everyone under Mr. Szwarc 's direction.<br /><br />In this episode , Nick Vera , gets closer to his neighbor , the mother of the basketball player the detective took his ball away . Nick is heading for romance with the woman !
1 I watch Cold Case because of the real life experiences depicted . This one was very close to me and touched me deeply , so beautifully handled , thanks , Merideth . All the characters are well developed 3D especially Coop . The material is still difficult to approach , the US is far behind the developed nations of the world . only this kind of honest actual experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population . of course , not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10 . you 're reaching the hard ones - i will forever reserve the " best episode " place for this episode . Please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude .
1 Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing ! It has officially become my new favourite movie.<br /><br />I do n't know what all the hate here is about , maybe it 's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before . I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy . Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead , but there will be a lot of supporting male characters . This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers , Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked . All of the actresses delivered very funny performances ( especially Missi Pyle ) from a quirky and lovable script.<br /><br />The charm of this film , to me , seems to be in its subtle feminist message : accepting who you are , female success in the public sphere , the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles . Light - hearted though it is , each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more ' fun ' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all - female cast and lack of a big - name actor to get the studios behind it , and I have to agree . Everyone I 've recommended this film to has loved it and I think it 's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness has n't been widely accepted and successful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female - centred comedy .
1 Let 's set one thing straight : this movie does not seek to redefine the genre , it 's not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein . It 's a silly flick , with three great female leads ( ca n't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics ) , Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and indie queen Parker Posey , charming as ever . The story is basic : the three gals were " losers " in college , and are still after wards it . Poehler is a dog trainer ( who ca n't even get a date with a blind guy ) , Posey is an assistant for a senator ( who " has n't been touched by a man since Clinton was in office " ... i catched that one several minutes later ... i 'm a little slow , OK ! ) , and Dracht has a gay fiancée ( Seth Meyers from SNL , funny ) . They have to prevent the " uncool " daughter of the senator ( the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the TV series " Joan of Arcadia " ) to embarrass her during spring break . So of course they have to go to watch over her , and some hilarity ensues . All in all , a light , simple comedy , quite short , and quite enjoyable
1 I do n't think this movie is for everyone . But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny . I have n't laughed that hard during a movie in long time . I thought the entire cast did a great job . You will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene . I suspect some moviegoers ( especially the ones who take themselves WAY too seriously ) will be turned off by this brand of humor . Not me . The movie was a real surprise . And the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing I went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change . I can not wait to see it again ! If you 're in the mood to LOL then this is for you . Funny funny funny funny !
1 Anyone who lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this film . It is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a " spring break movie " PLUS it makes fun of the college film genre . It 's funny , it 's got a cast to die for ( Amy Pohler ! Rachel Dratch ! , Sophie Monk ! , Parker Posey ! Jane Lynch ! Amber Tamblyn ! Missi Pyle ! ) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud . Writer/ actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain . Wilson Phillips ! OMG ! ( I 'm just repeating myself now ... ) It will live on with girls who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they 're dumb .
1 This is n't Masterpiece Theater . You should n't go into it expecting that . This is pure girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads . Like someone else here said , this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be . And the only downside I see to this film is that Tina Fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet . The film is pure silliness on the surface , but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now . PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape .
1 For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them . Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception . It is the truth . It is the best " bad " movie ever.<br /><br />The " badness " of this movie seems to come naturally . Halfway through Satan 's opening monologue , the word " Hell " appears at the bottom of the screen . The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress . It takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other FOREVER to walk down the stairs . Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack.<br /><br />Anyways , Fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior 's film project . But it 's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful . You get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad , but never forced it.<br /><br />Never to be duplicated in wonder , Fatty delivers . Highly highly recommended .
1 No , I 'm not joking around . If you ever , EVER , have the chance to see this movie see it . If you need chop off your arm to see it , see it . It 's worth it.<br /><br />Fatty Drives The Bus is unlike any film you 've ever seen . It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art . While it contains poor shots , idiotic characters , bad dialogue , strange acting , and cinematography that belongs on public access in Iowa , it actually succeeds in its goal as a film . It strives to be the dumbest , strangest , most inane movie you 've ever seen . And boy does it ever succeed.<br /><br />I will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things ( the filmmakers obviously did n't ) , but really you need n't pay too much attention because the entire film 's plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits . In any event , FDTB ( as its admirers call it ) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago , which is led by Satan . You see , Jesus is in town , and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die , and all their souls would have gone to hell , except with Jesus in town , a lackey in hell calls off the job , and this angers Satan because , well he does n't like looking like a fool in front of the guy , so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly , but he 's a devil , so he needs to disguise himself , otherwise , who 'd go on a tour with him right , so he disguises himself as Roger and he gets on the bus , where the driver is never referred to by name , but he is kind of fat , so I guess he 's Fatty . The bus ( and the riders ) are on a collision course with wackiness!<br /><br />Examples of some lunacy : The title repeats on the screen 3 times . I do n't know why . A character appears on the bus in mid - trip without explanation or introduction , and occassionally sits next to the others , and they look at her like she does n't belong . I do n't know why . Two characters fall in love and exchange longing glances , that are really the same shots repeated over and over again . I do n't know why . After Satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes " Satan is going to transform . " I do n't know why . One character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag , and is referred to by other characters as " the glamorous Bridget . " I do n't know why.<br /><br />If there was one good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer it was getting my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus .
1 FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest , most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing.<br /><br />this movie is by no means up to Hollywood standards , or even that of a straight - to - video movie fluff comedy starring terry " hulk " hogan , in terms of camera work , editing , acting , budget , or anything else.<br /><br />what this movie DOES have though , is a very original and enjoyable story , and it is obviously done by people who love making it , and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting downfalls.<br /><br />this movie proves that you do n't need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great film , all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doing.<br /><br />simply the best movie ever . i do n't care how you get it , rent it , order it , steal it , download it , just see this movie.<br /><br />now i just hope they make a DVD version .
1 This movie is not only the funniest film ever created , it 's the greatest . My hats off to Mr. and Mrs. Zodsworth and the rest of the wacky , wacky cast . Good morning Satan , Want a donut ? See it post haste ! GO SEE IT NOW !
1 What an amazingly funny and original show . The cast starting with the hysterical Julie Brown(Homecoming Queen 's Got A Gun ) is just perfect . Add Amy Hill(All American Girl - Grandma Kim ) who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner(Asian restaurant - WOK - DON"T RUN ) I have laughed harder during this show than any other I have ever seen(including Newhart - one of my all time favorite shows ) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane- you will love this series ! ! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself . When she snubs Tammy at the dry cleaners , Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat . The picture is of Cindy Williams doing an unmentionable act with a bowling pin - upside down . It is awesome to see an actress like Cindy Williams being able to play herself like this . Soap opera like with many surprise twists during its short run . I can only hope that this will someday be released on DVD with special many bonus special features . Funniest series I have ever seen ! ! ! !
1 I really wonder how this show plays in the U.K. and the rest of Europe . IT IS SO SELF - LOATHING ABOUT BEING AN American(particularly white Americans ) . That could be a big reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this board . I love the show but it is with some reservations and I feel it took the easy way out by Spoiler Spoiler:<br /><br />Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season . Julie slammed the door shut on any hope of reviving the show unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farm . Who knows ? It was a funny , raunchy and on occasion , kinda scary show .
1 Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice . Florence who ? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen . I soon found out who Florence Rice was , A real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance . As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece . From 1939 , its a different time but therein lies the charm . It transports you into another world . It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious . Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine . She is absolutely delightful , at the same time strong , vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman . Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie . She made over forty movies , and I am going to seek out the other thirty nine . Alan Marshal is of the Flynn / Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence . Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some excellent comic moments , but the real star is Florence Rice . Fans of 30's/40 's movies , Do n't miss this one !
1 Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon did two movies together within two years . One is considered one of the great romantic films of all time , and the movie that made Olivier a great movie star ( and gave Oberon her best performance role ) : WUTHERING HEIGHTS . The other is this film , made in England a year earlier . THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy ( as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy ) . Olivier is a lawyer , Everard Logan , who is a dynamic barrister , but is also a total misogynist . One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people . It is a very foggy night ( the type of pea soup fog that London was known for up until a notorious " killer " fog in the 1950s ) , and the crowd ( who 'd been attending a party in the hotel ) need beds . The management tries to get Logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms , but he refuses . But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele . The granddaughter of a high court judge , she manages to get into Logan 's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there , but appropriates his bed ( he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).<br /><br />The next day they share a breakfast , and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women Logan finds Leslie very attractive . But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name . She is determined to learn more about him , and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating . In the meantime , Logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman ( Ralph Richardson as Lord Mere ) as a potential client . Mere suspects his wife Lady Mere ( Binnie Barnes ) of having an affair . In fact , he tells Logan her Ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that Logan knows he was in on the night of the fog . Logan ( naturally ) jumps to the conclusion that Lady Mere was his mysterious roommate that night . I will not go into the plot any further , except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made , and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.<br /><br />The script has the feel of a Wodehouse novel , but is slighter . Still the performances of Olivier , Oberon , Richardson , Barnes , and Morton Selden ( as Oberon 's grandfather ) are all splendid . It shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials . Take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what I mean : Selden 's first scene , complaining about his weak coffee to his butler / valet , who tells him off properly ( they 've been used to each other 's personalities for years ) . Or Olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office , who is certain there were two Lady Meres in the office two minutes before ( there were , but Oberon and Barnes left together ) , and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton . Or the waiter in the hotel who ca n't understand why the tenant in Olivier 's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man . As I said , a slight charming comedy - but it is very charming .
1 I have become quite fond of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks , and was thrilled when I discovered this gem . I have always found it wonderful when I run across a film where I do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is charming till the final scene , and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938 . I only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is well worth anyone 's time .
1 This is an absolutely charming film , one of my favourite romantic comedies . It 's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful . Though Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre . He manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor , who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways , to the lovesick puppy that falls for Lady X played by Merle Oberon effortlessly . The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting . Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well . I highly recommend it .
1 Laurence Olivier , Merle Oberon , Ralph Richardson , and Binnie Barnes star in " The Divorce of Lady X , " a 1938 comedy based on a play . Olivier plays a young barrister , Everard Logan who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room , when the London fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home . The next day , a friend of his , Lord Mere ( Richardson ) , announces that his wife ( Barnes ) spent the night with another man at the same hotel , and he wants to divorce her . Believing the woman to be Oberon , Olivier panics . Oberon , who is single and the granddaughter of a judge , pretends that she 's the lady in question , Lady Mere , when she 's really Leslie Steele.<br /><br />We've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time . With this cast , it 's delightful . I mean , Richardson and Olivier ? Olivier and Oberon , that great team in Wuthering Heights ? Pretty special . Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight , nervous barrister . Oberon gives her role the right light touch . She looks extremely young here , fuller in the face , with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her . She wears some beautiful street clothes , though her first gown looks like a birthday cake , and in one gown she tries on , with that hair - do , she 's ready to play Snow White . Binnie Barnes is delightful as the real Lady Mere.<br /><br />The color in this is a mess , and as others have mentioned , it could really use a restoration . Definitely worth seeing .
1 An incredible little English film for so many reasons . First it 's a rare look a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy . While his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century , he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister . Historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot . Being English it did n't have the big budget of the Hollywood films of the same era and it often shows , but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an England that would soon be gone . When we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest American counter part ` It Happened One Night ' were in their day as risqué as ` Fatal Instinct ' was in our time . But after watching and enjoying this movie the first time I ca n't help but feel sadness when I watch it today . With half of film shoot before 1950 gone , saving the remaining films means hard choices , and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important . The color shifting , lack of contrast , and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking . This movie along with ` It Happened One Night ' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch , or better yet why not a double feature .
1 A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort " The Divorce Of Lady X ( 1938 ) " . It marks the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon , before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century English moors . And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well - suited to screwball comedy , it all flows along nicely . Oberon is Leslie , a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer Logan 's ( Olivier ) hotel suite by way of a nasty English fog preventing travel . She does everything possible to irritate him -- but , in the crazy way films go , he falls for her . And she falls for him . But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon 's " Lady X " ( that 's all she leaves Oliver in a note ) is thought by Olivier to be a married woman . To make matters worse , and more amusing , Lord Mere ( Ralph Richardson ) goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear Larry thinks must be Oberon ! There is some nice battle - of - the - sexes dialogue , and fun exploration of sexual politics . You can see that Olivier is not too confident with the comedy , but in true Olivier he 's a consummate professional , and delivers . And he handles the screwball twists and turns , maybe not with ease , but with gusto . Oberon was no great shakes as an actress , but she was usually competent enough , and despite their reputed off - screen dislike of her , worked well with Olivier . This was filmed in early Technicolour that looks very primitive today ( everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson ) , but perhaps the print needs cleaning up .
1 I had really only been exposed to Olivier 's dramatic performances , and those were mostly much later films than * Divorce*. In this film , he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy Merle Oberon , and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm .
1 Obviously written for the stage . Lightweight but worthwhile . How can you go wrong with Ralph Richardson , Olivier and Merle Oberon .
1 It 's a cooking competition show , Americanized . It 's not going to be the Japanese version.<br /><br />The show is great . I could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch ... From the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman . Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV . < br /><br />You could critique the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh . It 's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize . < br /><br />Oh yeah and I 'm bitter John Besh is n't the new Iron Chef ... < br /><br />Ala Cuisine !
1 With all of the violence on TV and in the local news , it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language , yet is still entertaining . My children look forward to watching with us every week . Each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judges . We all enjoy Elton Brown . We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient , unique vegetables and seasonings . We play along at home to guess who the winner will be.<br /><br />It is a great hour of entertainment , as well as informational . Best of all in our hussle , bussle life , it is an hour the family spends together .
1 I know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original , however sometimes spin - offs can stand on their own merits . I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time caters to American spirit . I love Alton Brown as commentator , because he explains things with flair . The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting . I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time , but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them . Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when cooking , making comments and being flashy while creating . I have watched the series and find all the players work together well . The judges are not always the best choices , however . There are a few exceptions , like the lawyer turned foodie , but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served . I enjoy watching the chefs hustle and the challengers are surprising . The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen . Perhaps that is all anyone can ask , to want to really eat what is served . The only thing I would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little . Sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tense , and that is n't always fun to watch when you are expecting more amusement . I liked the version with William Shatner ( Iron Chef USA ) because it was so over - the - top like the original , but I can tell it was a pretty expensive proposition . I wish he had stayed with this version and been the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown , that would have me grinning for an hour . As long as you do n't expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits , you may find it to be an enjoyable hour .
1 What a night . Perry Mason then Have Gun , Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke ( when it was a half hour ) and finally at 10:30PM came ' Sea Hunt ' with its wonderful opening theme music and Mike 's boat sailing off to a new adventure . Terrific .. Regardless of the story it was the lead character ( played by Lloyd Bridges ) , strong , honest , sincere . A Man 's Man and a Boy 's Man . This brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years . Why they do n't show on cable or make it available on video , no idea .. Too bad .
1 I loved watching ' ' Sea Hunt '' back in the day , I was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch ' ' Sea Hunt '' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures .I loved it ! He took to you a place not very accessible at that time , under the great blue sea . Pre ' ' Thunderball '' or even before Cousteau became common , there was Mike Nelson sparking the imagination of kids .I'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .Underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show . Watch and enjoy ! ! !
1 Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series . What made it so good to me when I watched it was the real feel of going underwater . The show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious.<br /><br />The show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro , Mike Nelson . There were excellent shows , and the program always appeared to be well produced . Granted , the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it 's own with any other show produced during this era , the infancy of American television .
1 The freedom of having your own Sea Going Power Boat , the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged , an 's man of an adventurer and lovely(and so well endowed ! ) assistants in fine Bikinis were all definite selling points for " SEA HUNT"(1958 - 61).<br /><br />Just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going " gun for hire " * series . Let 's look closely now . There must be a some clues around.<br /><br />If we were to look back just a little , we see the RKO Radio Pictures production of UNDERWATER ! ( 1955 ) . It starred Jane Russell , Gilbert Roland , Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive Scuba Diving Adventurers working on salvage in the Carribbean , including a Pre - Fidel Cuba . The film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits . Fine , shapely Women Folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits ( Woo , woo , woo , woo ! ) are always a plus for the Guys ; and the presence of rugged , athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake " poses " is equally pleasing to the Gals.<br /><br />And there is one element that is a true legacy of this old RKO Feature . It is on the Soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes . It is the Recording of " It 's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White " , written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and His Orchestra.<br /><br />Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song ( with Lyrics)will not soon forget it . Its Carribbean Beat is so very lively and its rich use of the Brass Section of the Orchestra is Powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory . The 45 RPM Record of this Song made it to the Top 10 most Popular Songs of the Week for many Saturday Evenings on NBC TV 's " YOUR HIT PARADE " . We ca n't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got . ( Maybe some one can fill us in on that one item , please ! ) So , we got back to " SEA HUNT " and its own odyssey in getting on " the Tube " . The public had taken to UNDERWATER ! all right , but would they go for a TV Series.<br /><br />ZIV TV Productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that , for the most part , did n't get signed on by the Networks for the multi - station hook - up treatment . But they had been having some great successes with Television Syndication . * * By that we mean , offering a Series for Stations for showings on a one to a TV Station per each Market Area . ( Much like the various Newspaper Syndicates " sell " Comic Strips to various Papers around the Country , and World , even.<br /><br />So , we got ' Mike Nelson ' , himself , in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges . Mr. Bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of Boston Blackie movies ( with Chester Morris)to THEY STOOGE TO CONGA ( 3 Stooges 1943 ) , SAHARA ( also 1943 ) , HOME OF THE BRAVE ( 1949 ) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS(1951).<br /><br />Lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization , along with a fine , convincingly athletic physique , having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities . He took very well as the Diver 's Diver , whether it 's performing duties on board ship , or fathoms beneath the Sea.<br /><br />And Lloyd did take to the role quickly , but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there , he was not familiar with S.C.U.B.A. * * * prior to landing this Mike Nelson gig . But the Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a quick learner , as so many of the close - up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it , that it was Lloyd with the mask , the bubbler(air tank ) and the flipper fins.<br /><br />Stories almost always involved the helping - out some client for pay , much like a Private Detective would . So what if the client was a lovely Lady who looked good in the Bathing Suit , all the better.<br /><br />Like so many of the other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions,"SEA HUNT " possessed a fine , haunting Opening Theme and Closing , along with some original incidental music and queues.<br /><br />At one time , I believe that " SEA HUNT " was the top syndicated TV Series , a success that ZIV Series had known before with the likes of " SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE"and " HIGHWAY PATROL " . As far as the showing venue for this underwater saga , here in Chicago it was shown late night ( after 10:30 P.M. ) on WNBQ TV , Channel 5 ( our NBC Affiliate , now known as WMAQ TV).<br /><br />And I can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was . And there were even on scene commercials done by the Star ! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson , riding on his Power Boat . And as we were being invited to return the next week and watch " ..... another adventure of " SEA HUNT " , sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse , Wisconsin ' the makers of Old Style Lager Beer ! " , all while Mike was toasting us , raising an Old Style Bottle . ( Shame on you , Mike ! Drinking Beer on your moving Boat ! We 're tellin ' the Coast Guard ! ) Then , the Boat would leave the dock , accompanied by the Sea Hunt Theme and rolling the Credits.<br /><br />NOTE : * More figuratively than literal , Mike was for hire and things ran very much like a Deterctive Story.<br /><br />NOTE : * * ZIV 's Syndicated successes included " SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE " , " WEST POINT"(and its clone " MEN OF ANNAPOLIS " ) , " SEA HUNT " and " HIGHWAY PATROL".<br /><br />NOTE * * * And of course , SCUBA is a acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus .
1 I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me . I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero 's every week . You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt . We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure . Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies . So any ole way I believe I 've got what I wanna say . Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt . If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit , or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit , If this is so then I must go so lets do it .
1 This one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans , but I thought it was wonderful . It 's an episodic multi - character study of Tokyo 's poorest , who live in a city literally made from garbage . Though it looks like an A - Bomb just hit , the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor . The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum . All the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing , but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car . When not searching for food , they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house . An emotionally moving and beautiful film .
1 < br /><br />In 1970 , after a five year absence , Kurosawa made what would be his first film in color . Dodes ' Ka - Den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small Tokyo slum.<br /><br />The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train . We slowly get to know more of the people in the small community , the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have . The old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him . The very poor father and son that can not ever afford a house , so they imagine one up of their own . By the end of the film , the stories all come full circle , some turn out happy , others sad.<br /><br />Since this was Kurosawa 's first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows . Maybe too much . This movie goes in many different directions and it 's hard to settle down and get into it . But do n't get me wrong , Dodes ' Ka - Den may not be Kurosawa 's best , but coming from the greatest director of all time , it 's much better than 99 % of today 's films .
1 Another demonstration of Kurosawa 's genius , his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers , essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post - war shanty town . Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back , this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way , mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads , withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol . Mixing kitchen - sink realism with Kabuki - esque theatrics , Kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience , drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness . A wonderful , draining experience .
1 If there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong in making Dodes'ka - den , it was making it with the partnership he formed with the " four knights " ( the other three being Kobayaski , Ichikawa , and Konishita ) . They wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership , and instead Kurosawa , arguably the head cheese of the group , delivered an abstract , humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies . Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows , but it was because of this , among some other financial and creative woes , that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 . And yet , at the end of the day , as an artist Kurosawa did n't stop delivering what he 's infamous for with his dramas : the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity . That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most should n't be ignored , but it 's not at all a fault of Kurosawa's.<br /><br />The material in Dodes'ka - den is absorbing , but not in ways that one usually finds from the director , and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot . There 's things that happen to these people , and Kurosawa 's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole . The character who starts off in the picture , oddly enough ( though thankfully as there 's not much room for him to grow ) , is Rokkuchan , a brain damaged man - child who goes around all day making train sounds ( the ' clickety - clack ' of the title ) , only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother . But then we branch off : there 's the father and son , the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site - specific descriptions of his dream house ; an older man has the look of death to him , and we learn later on he 's lost a lot more than he 'll tell most people , including a woman who has a past with him ; a shy , quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father ( or uncle , I 'm not sure ) , who rapes her ; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around.<br /><br />There are also little markers of people around these characters , like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night , like clockwork , putting big demands on their spouses , sometimes ( unintentionally ) swapping them ! And there 's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman . And of course there 's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum , not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it 's about something erotic with a guy . First to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture ; it 's a little post - apocalyptic , looking not of any particular time or place ( that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets ) . It 's a marginalized society , but the concerns of these people are , however in tragic scope , meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force . Like Bergman , Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people , with one scene in particular when the deathly - looking man who has hollow , sorrowful eyes , sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it.<br /><br />Sometimes there 's charm , and even some laughs , to be had with these people . I even enjoyed , maybe ironically , the little moments with Rokkuchan ( specifically with Kurosawa 's cameo as a painter in the street ) , or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics . But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise , his camera movements still remain as they 've always been- patient but alert , with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots , painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper . Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories , with some of them ( i.e. the father and son in the car ) especially sad , Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in Eastmancolor like it 's one of his paintings . Lush , sprawling , spilling at times over the seams but always with some control , this place is not necessarily " lighter " ; it 's like the abstract has come full - throttle into the scene , where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath . It 's a brilliant , tricky double - edged sword that allows for the dream - like intonations with such heavy duty drama.<br /><br />With a sweet ' movie ' score Toru Takemitsu ( also responsible for Ran ) , and some excellent performances from the actors , and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career , Dodes'ka - den is in its own way a minor work from the director , but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms , which as with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality .
1 " Dô desu ka den " is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa , and surprisingly is not about samurais , ronins , warlords or battlefields . It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo , where the dwellers are homeless drunkards , beggars , tramps , abused women , losers . I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors , but indeed they are very sad stories , some of them heart - breaking . I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them ; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train ; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters ; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather . My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Dodeskaden  O Caminho da Vida " ( " Dodeskaden  The Way of the Life " )
1 Most people , when they think of expressionist cinema , look to the b&w German films of the silent and early sound eras -- films that emphasized canted angles , extreme contrasts of light and dark , exaggerated performance , and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional , naturalistic modes of cinematic representation . If we 're willing to accept that the Germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema ( and that those above - mentioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film ) , then I would argue that Dodes'ka - den ( DKD ) is a prime example of this type of film . < br /><br />Like Dreams , DKD is a little unhinged for a Kurosawa film , dabbling , as it does , in the unreal . However , DKD is also , unlike Dreams , a great film and probably my favorite Kurosawa picture . Why ? Mostly , I think , it 's the colors . This was , I believe , Kurosawa 's first color film , and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors , creating a completely unreal contemporary Japan . We are used to the neon lights and gleaming Tokyo skyscrapers ; we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons . < br /><br />DKD is , as I said , a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard , appearing to live in an alternate universe . That is , I think , the point -- these are the Tokyo outsiders , the people left behind during the great move forward following World War II . The film also represents one of Kurosawa 's more heartfelt movies ; there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos ( such as when the boy 's father describes their dream home ) . It 's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning , John Ford - like vistas and samurais . Everyone should have known Kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this ( Ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways ) . < br /><br />I will also argue , to the last , that this is Kurosawa 's greatest achievement . His samurai films , though capable pictures , pale in comparison to works by Kobayashi ( Hara - kiri is the greatest , most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid ) . Rashomon , Hidden Fortress , Seven Samurai , Yojimbo , Sanjuro , Kagemusha , and Ran are all fine films , but they 're merely good ( and , frankly , I think that word is too generous for Hidden Fortress and Kagemusha ) . DKD is a great movie , as is Ikiru . They are the crown jewels that show Akira was not a one - trick samurai pony . They reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema .
1 This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched . That 's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film . Kurasawa 's experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences . Not every episode is depressing and harsh , but overall this is definitely the tone . Let 's see, ... we have a case of incest / rape , attempted murder , wife swapping , alcoholism , infidelity , death of a little boy after eating tainted fish , a man with severe depression ( he never talks during the movie and looks very scary ) , a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia , a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments " driving " his street car through paths among the garbage piles , a man married to a total shrew ( I think I liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist ! ) , etc . , etc . In fact , it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan , as Bergman made MANY movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life . Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself ? ! So , did I like it ? No . It was not a fun experience . But , it was a very well - made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result , I really wanted to see what happened to these people . It was sort of like watching a train wreck -- you do n't WANT to see all the carnage but you ca n't help but watch ! Of all the vignettes , I think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who did n't really seem to fit in ( he was too well - adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump ) was perhaps meant to represent Kurasawa himself . Maybe . I dunno.<br /><br />If you 've seen a variety of Kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films , give this one a watch . However , do NOT make this your first experience watching his movies -- it 's sure to scare away many viewers !
1 The title of this movie does n't make a lot of sense , until you see it in operation , because it 's the sound that a retarded young man makes while he 's operating his imaginary trolley , which is what he does all day . And he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal & at times , tragic tale of a group of slum - dwellers in Japan.<br /><br />There are two drunks who trade wives , there 's a man with aspirations to be a architect , and his young son who he sends out to beg for food . There 's a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him , and there 's a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him ( and everyone else ) like dirt.<br /><br />There 's no particular plot to this , really , it 's a bunch of stories that drift back & forth between each other , sometimes funny , sometimes tragic . All in all I thought it worked pretty well , & I had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description . I was not in the least disappointed , and I 'd definitely recommend this . 9 out of 10 .
1 The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live . The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump . It 's a mix of laughter and sadness.<br /><br />First color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I 've wanted to see for a long time . Weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material . I was holding out for the full version , waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see , only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version.<br /><br />Finally sitting down to see the film last night I 'm of mixed emotions about the film . First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed . You can see every other of Kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie , down to the painted sunsets . Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with ( of course there are failed projects as well ) . The film is a visual work of art.(Though be warned if you 're going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot 1.33 so will appear in normal TV ratio . ) The rest of the film is a mixed bag . Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people do n't quite come together . As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they do n't hang as one . I do n't blame Kurasowa since one ca n't always hit things out of the box , especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi - character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself.<br /><br />This is n't to say that there are n't reasons to see the film . As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see his films , whether they work or not . The first trip of the " trolley " is one of the best things Kurasowa ever did and is worth the price of a rental . Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out . The father and son living in the car is touching ( though ultimately very sad ) and there are other bits and pieces that shine ( like the cast which is across the board great ) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas.<br /><br />Its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers successes.<br /><br />Between 6 and 7 as a whole , much higher in pieces .
1 The title is onomatopoeic , the sound of a streetcar clacking on the rails . It is metaphoric for all that the people who live in the dump can not have . The misery of those people is illustrated by the passing streetcar which represents the relatively unobtainable rich life of the middle class . The pathos of the little boy and his beloved yet sadly insane father is most touching . This was Kurosawa 's first film in colour and he uses beautifully shocking hues , colours seen only in dreams . The movie is surreal and surpassing in beauty . The compassion for humanity is the underling force , but as always , Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film . It is a masterwork by a genius of cinema .
1 I first saw this movie as a pre - teen , about the age when kids start to think through their identity . I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own . The eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father ( which Kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other ) . The man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts . The man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one , who still prefers her brother.<br /><br />Each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions.<br /><br />It 's a great film , even if it is not the greatest Kurosawa film .
1 This , and " Hidden fortress " are the Kurosawa 's that are most dear to me . I do n't hand out 10 's like candy , but this certainly deserved it , if anything . Even though it 's quite long ( like all Kurosawa 's pretty much are ) it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films ; the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving , containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description . Dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example " Hidden fortress " did ; despite its lenght , there was n't a single minute I would cut out.<br /><br />This is also a very unusual Kurosawa film in a way , it has no storyline , but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline , unlike any other Kurosawa - film I have seen so far . It also leans much on the dialogue , which he uses brilliantly ( especially in the story between the father and the son planning their " new house " ) . < br /><br />Still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is , is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically , without pointing fingers at anybody at any point . From the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance .
1 Kurosawa is a proved humanitarian . This movie is totally about people living in poverty . You will see nothing but angry in this movie . It makes you feel bad but still worth . All those who 's too comfortable with materialization should spend 2.5 hours with this movie .
1 Kurosawa , fresh into color , losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo 's slums . Kurosawa stretches for a style that was , in my opinion , his antithesis- that is to say , I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu picture . Poorly paced , poorly conceived , this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work . While Ikiru , while being mundane and depressing , was still interesting and well paced , and while Stray Dog depicted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy handed or boring , do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content , with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier Kurosawa pictures.<br /><br />Be warned , this is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged by .
1 I loved this movie ! It 's truly bizarre , extremely funny , morbid , witty ... It makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie , because then I 'd be giving out the outcome ! You have to see it without knowing what is it about ! Everything is connected and has its why & because . It starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine ! It 's even more fun to watch the movie the second time , once you know all the " tricks " . The actors are excellent , especially Ivan Trojan , whose final scenes are a real master piece ! I highly recommend this film , it 's one of the most original ones I 've ever seen !
1 This definitely is NOT the intellectual film with profound mission , so I really do n't think there is too much not to understand to in case you are n't Czech.<br /><br />It 's just a comedy . The humor is simple , pretty funny and sometimes , maybe , little morbid . Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári ( 2000 ) ( Jirí Machácek , Ivan Trojan , Vladimír Dlouhý ) so the authors are . But it does n't matter , the genre is really different and these two films should n't be compared in this way . Jedna ruka netleská wo n't try to give you a lesson , it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeed.<br /><br />Not bad film , not the ingenious one , but I enjoyed it . Some scenes are truly worth seeing .
1 Basic meaning of the story is a reality . Cruel true reality . Situations are very funny . You have to laugh when you see , how people can be stupid , obstinate and crazy . The best description will be , if you watch it on your own .
1 It helps if you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czechs obsession with ' The Professionals ' , but if not , ' Jedna ruka netlaska ' is yet another great Czech film . It is funny , dark and extremely enjoyable . The highest compliment I can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing.<br /><br />For a small country the Czech Republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature , from Hrabal , Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel , Sverak and numerous others . Czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising , but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it . This film is just that , it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings , but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise , good intent and optimism.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in . Enjoy it , it 's a film made for just that reason - anyway , it 's as close as the Czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending ...
1 The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories : smart and stupid . Simple enough.<br /><br />Jiri Machacek ( Standa ) plays a hapless , dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit . When he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil , former boss , the situation gets out of control.<br /><br />While Standa is genuinely ( but endearingly ) stupid , his buddy Ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time . Without Ondrej , Standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success . With Ondrej , life will never be boring , but it sure wo n't be without a lot of headaches!<br /><br />Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek , an evil genius type who degenerates into some Hitler - esquire delusional tyrant . Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek 's secrets safe.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films . For a relatively small country , the Czech Republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment . The best Czech movies I have seen are : 1 ) Peliky and 2 ) Tmavomodrý Svet ( Dark Blue World ) . If you see these two movies , you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema .
1 I like this movie much , it 's special type of humor by Ondricek and Machacek ... I think it 's better then Samotari ( Loners ) .. Maybe it 's difficult to understand when you are not Czech . If you are not watching that movie , just enjoy it , do n't mind about anything else .. just relax ! !
1 If , like me , you like your films to be unique , and unlike the majority of other movies , then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast . The film is a grotesque , erotic , fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological ' Beast ' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women . The film is very daring with it 's subject material , and that is something to give it credit for . The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo , and for good reason , I might add ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point . Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre , The Beast could have gone around it , and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps , but Borowczyk did n't do that , and he is brave in that respect , especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms , but the fact that he went ahead with it , in my view , means a big thumbs up for the guy.<br /><br />The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female . This opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience , in some ways , for the incredible , tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see . The scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking , and are bound to offend many people ( hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years ) , but these scenes are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer ; this film has a defining point . As said during the film ; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence . Both man and beast have instincts , only man knows how to control them . The Beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality ; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire , and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast . The film has strong themes of the age - old story of ' beauty and beast ' weaved into it , and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust , but not without a moral.<br /><br />Many criticise the scenes around the film 's shocking sex sequences for being boring , but these scenes are important to the film 's story . Without these scenes , we would n't get to know the characters or the story of the beast , and , most importantly ; the story of ' beauty and the beast ' would not be able to have it 's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience , and as that is one of the key elements of the film ; it would be a real shame . Besides that , Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes , not with shocks , but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family , along with the beautiful shots of the mansion 's ground would not be seen , and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.<br /><br />Overall , The Beast is a shocking film . It 's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone . However , if you can get over the film 's shock , and embrace The Beast ; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance .
1 " La Bête " by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story " Lokis " written by Prosper Merimée . Lucy Broadhurst(Lisabeth Hummel),an American heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished Marquis , arrives at the family 's crumbling château and learns of a mythical ursine beast purported to prowl the nearby forest . It is fabled that a former lady of the house(Sirpa Lane)once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and Lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident . " The Beast " is an art - house mix of surreal horror , explicit sleaze and porno . There 's implied bestiality , assault and perversion in the priesthood , copious fake ejaculate smeared on bared breasts , masturbation with a rose and , most graphic of all , the eponymous beast toying with incredibly big phallus . Still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless . The women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the time . Overall " La Bête " is a visual feast . Whether it be from the fetishistic attention to detail , or the visual motifs pregnant with information , Borowczyk 's masterpiece should be watched with care and attention . A must - see for fans of European cult cinema .
1 OK ... this one 's a weirdy .... Honestly , I ca n't tell you all the inner plot - points of THE BEAST , cuz I started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes - but just wait , it definitely does " pick up" ... <br /><br />The plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some French aristocrat chick screwed back in the day . Eventually you see " THE BEAST " , which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat - bear costume with a horse cock attached to it . The scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep . The sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared . THE BEAST pops up , rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her . Eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast 's " attention " which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes , including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere ( yeah , I 've got a twisted foot - fetish - so sue me .... ) ... The whole film is told in flashbacks and long - winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious . A " shocking " but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film ... <br /><br />THE BEAST is a film that I find kind of hard to rate . The cinematography itself is quite eye - catching and the sets , costumes and locations are elaborate . The plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat - bear . A good bit of tits , ass , and hairy 70 's French bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film . I have to honestly say , that if it were n't for the graphic scenes of the BEAST spackling all over the willing maiden , this film would have been a real bore - that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex ( the beginning has a VERY up - close and personal scene of two horses boning , including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina ... YUM ! ! ! ) . But the BEAST sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film , that I have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer . I have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they 've seen it all - the BEAST rape really is out - there and something to be witnessed . Also recommended to any fans of 70's/80 's sleaze films - this one ranks pretty high with them . Worth a look for you sick rat - bear beastiality lovers out there ( like me) ... 8/10
1 Polish film maker Walerian Borowczyk 's La Bête ( French , 1975 , aka The Beast ) is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too . This film tells everything that 's generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images . The images may look wild , perverse , " sick " or exciting , but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned . Sex , desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it . They interest and temptate us so powerfully ( and by our nature ) that they are considered scary , unacceptable and something too wild to be true.<br /><br / > A sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a French countryside to meet her soon - to - become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind . All are very exciting and each others ' parents and relatives wait impatiently to see the new people arriving to their families . The innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful French mansion , with all its humans and animals , and a mysterious " la bête " that turns out to be something that the characters , nor most of the film 's audience , could have never imagined to be real and ( in front of ) them.<br /><br />The film is about the same theme as Canadian David Cronenberg 's debyt feature Shivers ( 1975 ) , which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory parasites spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act furiously and violently in their lust for pleasure and fulfilment of instincts . Human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal , a beast , be it a lust for blood , revenge or sex and carnal pleasure . Humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals , that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us . The film opens greatly , and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes , showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race , but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there , not the close - ups of organs as could be so easily claimed . The horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat , in heat that 's much stronger than his will as he does n't have any control at that point anymore . The power of the instinct makes an animal a beast.<br /><br />After the memorable beginning , the characters get introduced , and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their blossom , to the adults and elders that all represent their own part of the lifespan , creating the face of human life on screen . A film does n't necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race , including the urban and countryside inhabitants , and both sexes . The mansion makes the protagonist girl 's sexuality wake as she saws the horses coupling and acting like she obviously has never thought of . For the first time she sees something unique and something that excites and feels almost vital for her and her body , like getting water when you 're very thirsty . The transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her , with his mother and camera and a letter - boyfriend , even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out . Flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal , but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades ? Man 's stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated.<br /><br />The film 's last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning , and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk . As the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire , she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the undressed form of ourselves , having lived in the woods without other people / beasts near him . The dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the film 's overall straight and honest attitude , and the images are so easy to be judged as " perverse " and " pornographic " , without a courage to go deeper into them , character reactions and thoughts behind what we see . The images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the dream 's ( more ) human character , and Borowczyk forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a " normal " sexual act between a man and a female , which is a beautiful thing and expression of love , another human need . Also the numerous , and cleverly blackly humorous love making scenes inside the mansion , between the young mother and the black servant , get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant , for example , and there 's no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least does n't become any more pleasant by the interruption . Borowczyk has managed to paint his images so beautiful and " sensitive " that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood , but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art . He uses dialogue only when it 's necessary , otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful.<br /><br />Death is also there , as flesh dies sooner or later , after years of life and instincts , it dies . The ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and " revealing " ending too . Another blackly humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for ! They visited the mansion of truth about flesh , us and them . The film reminds me of French writer Georges Bataille 's Story of the Eye with its same themes about eroticism , death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh . The book is well written and fantastic as well as this film , and naturally both have been blamed for their " too explicit " content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments.<br /><br />Borowczyk 's film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty , and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film . The sun shines through the trees , and to everyplace where humans live , and the beauty of it is always there , but so is the ugliness that originates by the inhabitants of the world . To every innocent white sheep there 's a selfish , evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep , present inside every human soul . It is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active . The fulfilment of some of our instincts is not a bad thing , and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad , they can be satisfied without exploitation , violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it . Human is not more than an animal with intelligence , intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment . Borowczyk 's film is a masterpiece , unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with ageless theme and also an example of how much can be achieved , expressed and given by a film maker , who is also only a human .
1 Youth , sexuality , and the French countryside -- one of the more unique films you 're ever going to see . If you can see it that is , no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it ( a combination of scarcity and censorship . ) It 's sometimes erotic , sometimes disgusting , and occasionally funny . A trifle boring also in the middle , but all in all you ca n't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you 've seen this one at least once .
1 Perhaps it 's me and my perverted ways , or the fact that I tend to have a very sick mind , but I rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise , I enjoyed it . < br /><br />Yes , I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured I was prepared for anything it would offer . I was clearly deceived after seeing ... well ... everything , to cut a long story short . I can see why it was banned , not only for such explicit sex scenes , but for beastiality . < br /><br />Of course , as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast , a personal favorite of mine , it tells the story of a girl 's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever - the - hell - that - thing - was - like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation . Of course , the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods . < br /><br />But that 's not all . Oh , there is so much more ! < br /><br />Not only do we get to see interspecial sex , but there 's also humping horses , the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she 's not humping the bed to get her ... er ... satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals . < br /><br />Creative and enjoyable , but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after I went to bed ... I was 15 . Words of advice when watching this film : make sure you 're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed . It may be fun , but I doubt there are other porn films like this one .
1 Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor . The movie is well written and the acting seems like real life . For all lovers of Columbo this is a superior piece of work . Because it shows what a talent Peter Falk is . He does n't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman . By the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again . The interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it ; the depth of its ' pertinence will be the only thing that varies . It is a shame that the liberals in Hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of . This would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play .
1 This film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it . It is earthy , grounded and a film that will make you think ... and smile . Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget . The soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting ; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air . This surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors ! Finally , a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today . Never have I walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart ; for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket . To see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it .
1 Sam Kleinman ( Peter Falk ) comes to his son 's place unexpectedly . His son Ben Kleinman ( Paul Reiser ) is quite surprised to hear that his mother , Muriel Kleinman ( Olympia Dukakis ) has left his father . Ben 's wife , Rachel ( Elizabeth Perkins ) and his three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go see a farmhouse that 's for sale . But that 's not the end of their journey . Their road trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father . Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks ( 2005).Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job . The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing . And he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it 's this good . Who would be better man to play the father than Peter Falk ? Nobody , I can tell you that . And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part . Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh . And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie . It 's just hilarious when they go fishing . And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick . The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times . But it can also be touching from time to time . You could n't tell a story any better than it is told here .
1 Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we do n't see , what we expect and what surprises us . THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS does n't set any new standards for film , but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.<br /><br />Sam Kleinman ( Peter Falk ) has been a workaholic , at times pushing his wife Muriel ( Olympia Dukakis ) , his daughters ( Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan ) , and his son Ben ( Paul Reiser ) into the background . One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving ! Her daughters , along with Ben 's wife Rachel ( Elizabeth Perkins ) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts , leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben . The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members . Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living . The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story 's warm ending . All is not what it seemed : it 's better and , well , different.<br /><br />Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are , but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen , reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film . Well worth viewing . Grady Harp
1 I wo n't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground.<br /><br />Just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the film very much . Peter Falk 's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film.<br /><br />A small scale ' road trip ' movie with Falk & Paul Reiser in upstate NY in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film.<br /><br />Very well written with an adult target audience in mind . Plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family.<br /><br />Really ca n't say enough about this film except that it 's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this does n't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does.<br /><br />It 's great to see Falk with a big leading man role again & he makes the most of it . It proves that his famous friend & writer / director John Casavettes was right in casting Falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s & 70s .
1 Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business . I have read both of his books and think that he is great . Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them . The combination of the two is magic.<br /><br />This is a story about a family really getting to know each other . Through a road trip a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midts of a family crisis . They do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life ... they are just doing them much later in life . The situations are very funny , but have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life ( not obsurdly over the top or cartoonish ) . This is the first time that I watch Paul Reiser and fully believed every emotion that was portrayed . At times , his eyes look so sad.<br /><br />Gret movie and great story and plot . It has comedy and emotion but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job also :)
1 It is no wonder this movie won 4 prices , it is a movie that lingers to any soul , it is n't a wonder why it took Paul Reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea . I can understand every part of it , this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear , or thousands.<br /><br />Story : 10/10 When Sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her , and while they do that they find something lost , Friendship , family , and affection for each other . At the beginning you know what s going to happen , but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end , it is a ride between a father and his son , and a husband and his wife . It is no wonder it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy.<br /><br />Actors : 10/10 Well you ca nt say anything else that what i about to say , hey it is with Peter Falk in it , he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic , when you use Peter Falk in a romance / comedy what do you think you get ? A perfect outcome , it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices . As the son Paul Reiser does an excellent job , although he is n't a great actor always that does n't mean that this did n't work actually Peter Falk and Paul Reiser plays the perfect Father and Son , the rest of the cast is good enough but you do n't see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more . < br /><br />Music : 10/10 It does n't always work when using music sometimes it just does n't fit but that is not the thing in this movie , the music is perfect in tune , it makes the movie even more compelling . This part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts , a great soundtrack for a Romance / Comedy that s for sure.<br /><br />Overall : 10/10 There are so many Romance / Comedy movies out on tapes , DVDs , Blu - ray and what not , but this movie is one of the special ones . it does n't happen everyday that you can create a story like this , it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it , a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul , see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age , i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made .
1 The movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father.<br /><br />The brilliant dialog , lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers.<br /><br />The core issues of parenting , communication and manhood are explored indirectly.<br /><br />In fun ways the curtain is pulled back , the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed.<br /><br />All of this happens amidst a road trip format . The backdrop is rural New York state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors . WOW !
1 Excellent endearing film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as father and dad.<br /><br />Dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage , mom ( Olympia Dukakis ) has left him.<br /><br />The rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dad 's thoughts off what has occurred . With them away , the daughters can play detectives.<br /><br />The story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life , what should have been , why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of life.<br /><br />We see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl . Both men seem to break out of their daily lives.<br /><br />The end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left . It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity . It 's never too late to change .
1 This movie did n't really surprise me , as such , it just got better and better . I thought : " Paul Rieser wrote this , huh ? Well ... we'll see how he does ... " Then I saw Peter Falk was in it . I appreciate Colombo . Even though I was never a big fan of the show , I 've always liked watching Peter Falk . < br /><br />The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall . They played off of each other so well that I practically felt giddy with enjoyment ! ... And I had n't even been drinking!<br /><br />This movie was so well done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it ! but I could n't find his number . Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything . It just came on and I thought:"Eh , why not ? Let 's see . If I do n't like it - I do n't have to watch it ... " ... and I ended up just loving it !
1 Who does n't have unresolved issues with parents ? And which parents do n't have unresolved issues with each other?<br /><br />I know , that sounds heavy . But this is played for laughs in the movie , making both the comedy better and the drama better . I 've always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk , and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie , I was enchanted from the very first scene.<br /><br />Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person . And Peter Falk 's monologue about being a hard - working , sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point . Without that scene being acted so well , the movie would have seemed far less nuanced , and the character far less interesting.<br /><br />Nicely done , Paul and Peter !
1 I enjoyed this film , perhaps because I had not seen any reviews , etc . It was delightful and a little bit of a ' romp ' . I do n't know why it did n't make more of a splash than it did . As far as the story goes , I could relate to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character , and I could " see my dad " in Falk 's character . Made me remember a lot of past times when I was a kid and listening to my grandparents , too . If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond , this is your movie . A " sleeper " , in my opinion , and one of those feel - good stories . Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles , yet nothing was overdone . I would say it rates at least an 8 , perhaps higher .
1 This is one of the best movies I have ever seen . I feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey . One sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that " history repeats itself " . Life is what it is shown in the movie : when people are young , they seem not to understand their parents , their own spouses ; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late ; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners ; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives ; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved ; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world , and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves , so that when life has to end some day , people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life . The actors and actresses are fantastic . They have understood the director 's intention perfectly . The movie 's charm lies in , to me , the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience .
1 The movie was very moving . It was tender , and funny at the same time . The scenery was absolutely beautiful ! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award winning performances . Olympia Dukakis was great . I understand due to the story line her part had to be brief , but I did wish I could have seen more of her - she is a true pro . You will be able to recall experiences from your own life , hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie . We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser at a Q and A after the viewing . He is a wonderful man , clever , eloquent and a " real Person " . It was truly an enjoyable night out!This is a must see movie . You will be so grateful you went .
1 I 'm disappointed that Reiser ( who wrote the film ) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever . Maybe that 's his idea of " adult " films , plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in ? I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie.<br /><br />Falk 's acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating.<br /><br />This might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles . But the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails . Certainly not worth spending money on , though it might be worth a watch for free on television .
1 The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father , but also that son with his wife , his sisters and his mother . Paul Reiser has written a semi - autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father . The movie is funny , poignant and thought - provoking . It led me to re - evaluate my own relationship with both my now - deceased father and my adult son . Peter Falk is excellent as Paul 's father - the role could not have been better cast . I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser are recognized in next year 's movie awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his script .
1 Oscar - caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar - caliber - written role . I loved the nuanced , balanced exploration of a long - time marriage - how often do we get that in films , where usually the movie ends when boy & girl get together ? This is a movie for adults , a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband , wife , son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story . On top of that , it gave me about 10 major belly laughs , and I 'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing . This was one of the few truly funny movies I 've seen . Great , original jokes .
1 Who would n't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk ? That guy 's right eye has more character than most actors today . This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores . Women are going to love it for all the wake - up romance advice for men , and men will love it for its spot - on father / son character study -- one great little scene after another . And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find . Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it 's like to be both a father and a son , as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life . The most fun part , though , was watching Reiser watch Falk . You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk 's special craft . Really delightful . Let 's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks .
1 saw this in preview- great movie- wonderful characterizations- witty and intelligent dialog- actors were fantastic- Peter Falk will be up for an Oscar- Paul Reiser was charming- photography was marvelous Reiser was at the theater when we saw the film , and he gave a vivid account about the making of the film- it had been a long dream of his to write a semi - autobiographical account of relationships between sons and fathers , and more specifically between him and his father- this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion- the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of family- i recommend this film to anyone who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
1 Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie . Peter Falk gives the performance of his life . It is worthy of an Academy Award . This was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year . Reiser 's wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom " Mad about You " . Peter Falk did a masterful job as his dad , and Peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time . The supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins . It is a must see movie for 2005 . We bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another . We have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie . We have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different .
1 Murder in Mesopotamia , I have always considered one of the better Poirot books , as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending . There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking , with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score . As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot , the comedic highlight of the episode being Poirot 's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night , and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings . The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances , but are careful not to overshadow the two leads , a danger in some Christie adaptations . Some of the episode was quite creepy , a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs , an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one . What made it creepy in particular , putting aside the music was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window . About the adaptation , it was fairly faithful to the book , but I will say that there were three things I did n't like . The main problem was the pacing , it is rather slow , and there are some scenes where very little happens . I did n't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer . In the book , I see him as a rather nervous character , but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer , and under - developing that , made him a less appealing character , though I am glad they did n't miss his drug addiction . ( I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer 's next victim . ) The other thing that was n't so impressive was that I felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of Amy Leatheran , like it was in the book , Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation . On the whole , despite some misjudgements on the writers ' behalf , I liked Murder in Mesopotamia . 7/10 Bethany Cox .
1 < br /><br />"Bleak House " is hands down the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on screen . Alway one of My favorite novels , I was exteremely pleased with this Television Mini Series . The late , great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock . The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book , oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story . over all a brilliant , moving and atmosphereic film .
1 This production was made in the middle 1980s , and appears to be the first serious attempt to put BLEAK HOUSE on celluloid . No film version of the novel was ever attempted ( it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other , so that it would have been very hard to prune it down ) . The novel was the only attempt by Dickens to make a central narrator ( one of two in the work ) a woman , Esther Summerson . Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle , who ( in typical Dickens style ) mistreat her . She is illegitimate , but they wo n't tell her anything about her parentage . Later we get involved with the gentry , Sir Leicester Dedlock , and his wife . Lady Honoria Deadlock ( Dame Diana Rigg ) is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor Tulkinghorn ( Peter Vaughn ) . We also are involved with the actions of Richard Carstone ( Esther 's boyfriend ) in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case , Jarndyce v. Jarndyce , which everyone ( even Richard 's cousin John Jarndyce - played by Desmond Elliot ) warns is not worth the effort.<br /><br />Dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction . Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS , Dickens looked closely at the law . Mr. Bumble said it was " a ass " in OLIVER TWIST and Dickens would consistently support that view . He looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in TWIST , that the law barely tries to cure . He attacks the Chancery and outdated estate laws , as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers ( Tulkinghorn , Vholes ) in BLEAK HOUSE . In LITTLE DORRIT he attacks the debtors ' prisons ( he had hit it also in David COPPERFIELD ) . In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills . In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial . Dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries , including Thackeray.<br /><br />But the novel also looks at other problems ( like charity and religious hypocrisy , the budding Scotland Yard detective force , social snobbery in the industrial revolution ) . He also uses the novel to satirize various people : Leigh Hunt the writer , Inspector Fields of Scotland Yard , and even the notorious Maria Manning . Most of these points were kept in this fine mini - series version . If it is shown again on a cable station , catch it .
1 I have bought the DVD of this version to compare against the current BBC 2005 version ( which is brilliant ) . The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft , who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and who died this year ( 2005 ) . I remember great acting , especially from Rigg and Elliott , and moving music . ( Music in the 2005 version is far more understated , but very telling . ) Just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points : Richard Carstone is Ada Claire 's boyfriend , not Esther 's . Esther had no uncle . Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version , nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS ! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version . Toby was played by Bernard Hepton.<br /><br />Both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of Dickens ' great novel . Now read the book ! It 's not perfect , and the sentimentality may make you wince at times , but I defy you not to cry - and laugh !
1 I like this presentation - I have read Bleak House and I know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be , and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very good show with the staged Nicholas Nickelby . I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock , even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy . I am sorry , I think she is the best Lady Dedlock ... I am not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce , but I am OK with Mr. Elliott . It is not easy to present these long Dickens ' books - Oliver Twist would be easier - this is a long , and if you do n't care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring . I think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring . I just LOVED Mr. Smallweed - it can be entertaining . There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves ... <br /><br />I have to say I loved the show . Maybe if I read the book again , as I usually do , after seeing the movie , maybe I can be more critical . In the meantime - I think it is a good presentation .
1 I ca n't say how closely the film follows the novel , never having read the book , but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it 's a good bet that most of the base are covered or , at least , we can say with some certainty that this is n't a Reader 's Digest condensed version.<br /><br />The production values are high , well up to the standards of other BBC classic series like Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes . We can believe Dickens ' London looked , sounded , and thought a lot like this . There are some occasional minor lapses -- some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took place.<br /><br />The acting too is to be applauded . Suzanne Burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good . She 's cute too , in a mature way , her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness . Denholm Elliott is her guardian ( and more than that , as it turns out ) . Burden and Elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way . Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people . Another is a poor and helpless young boy.<br /><br />I do n't think anyone else could have written this . It 's got all the earmarks of Dickens -- poverty , tragic deaths , capitalism in the raw , the generous rich guy in his gated home , hidden parentage , shadowy motives , and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system . Well , not the justice system as a whole but the chancery , which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property . ( So I gather from Wikipedia . ) It became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in England in 1973 . Twice , Elliott 's character describes it as " a curse . " The most impressive scene involves a money - scrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latter 's gymnasium during a fencing lesson . The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember from Dickens . The apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another , each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor , while the scarlet - faced old creditor shrinks back into his seat.<br /><br />A couple of things are missing . Often Dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog . ( " Humbug ! " or " The law is a ass . " ) Not here . " Bleak " house is the right title . Second , there are practically no Weberian " ideal types " -- no Mr. Micawbers or Artful Dodgers or Scrooges . Third , the atmosphere , the whole ethos , is relentlessly dismal . One tribulation follows another , usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the past.<br /><br />My God , it 's depressing . It 's as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew . Poverty , okay . He KNEW poverty . But one wonders what the chancery did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment.<br /><br />Maybe I should add that I 've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series -- and it 's better in two ways . There is more zip in the direction , so the pace is a little faster . And the business of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front , instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious " curse , " so the plot is easier to follow .
1 This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me . The representation of the court of Chancery as a ' character ' in the drama is magnificent . The acting is marvellous , from the sinister Tulkinghorn , to the Dedlocks , Smallweed , Crooke , Miss Flyte , and the two young lovers . But it is the spider 's web of chancery that holds the whole thing together , and the cinematography is superb . What mistake did the BBC make about copyright that meant that this version could not be seen in the UK on either video or DVD for many years ? I tried to find out from them , but faced a stone wall . In the end I got a DVD copy from Canada .
1 You do n't need to read this review.<br /><br />An earlier review , by pninson of Seattle , has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production . I can only amplify its basic arguments.<br /><br />Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work . This is taken too literally by the director , Ross Devenish , who piles on the gloom and fog too much . When Ada , Rick and Esther appear , half an hour into the opening episode , it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time . In some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my TV screen . I watched the whole thing in one day , starting in mid - afternoon . As daylight faded this became less of an issue , but I have a pretty good TV and I have never encountered this problem before at any time of day.<br /><br />The pacing is very deliberate ( i.e. slow ) . I am sure this was intensional , but it is overdone . There are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of Victorian London that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere . A good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty - minute episode , without losing a line of dialogue , just by trimming each of these scenes slightly.<br /><br />I do n't want to overstate these two problems . You soon adjust to the look and pace of this production . The more important issue is that it does n't always tell the story very effectively . Earlier Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House , but are not nearly so intricately plotted . For example , I recently re - read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath crammed an 800 page book into his two - hour movie . The answer is simple : the book is full of padding . McGrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements . This would not be possible with Bleak House . < br /><br />This production needs its seven hours . Probably , it needs even longer , because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear , or as well handled , as they need to be . A few random examples will illustrate the problems.<br /><br />The maid , Rosa , appears from nowhere with no background , so Lady Dedlock 's attachment to her is largely unmotivated.<br /><br />Sergeant George 's acquiescence in Tulkinhorn 's demand for a sample of Horton 's handwriting is somewhat fudged.<br /><br />It is not made clear enough that Esther is actually in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce . Neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement , or why.<br /><br />Ada and Rick 's secret marriage is omitted . In one episode they are merely lovers , in the next , people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife.<br /><br />Mrs Rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and Sargeant George 's estrangement from his family is left unexplained - as is the means by which she is discovered.<br /><br />Tulkinhorn 's dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the Dedlock family is understated , so his motive for persecuting Lady Dedlock is more obscure than it need be.<br /><br />The involvement of the brick makers with both Tom and ( later ) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque.<br /><br />It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanished.<br /><br />This is only a selection : there are others . They are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough . Nonetheless , they are minor irritations that detract from its power : you should n't have to puzzle over little plot points . However , there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stages.<br /><br />The whole business of Tulkinhorn 's murder is somewhat thrown away . Bucket immediately pinpoints Hortense as a suspect , which undermines the suspense of Sergeant George 's predicament and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell . It also diminishes the impact of the sub - plot in which suspicion is thrown on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked in front of Sir Lester.<br /><br />A more serious problem is that the murder , its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock , dominate the story for over an hour , during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand : the legal case and its effect on Rick . His failing finances , his gouging by Vholes and Skimpole , Ada 's despair , his declining health and so on , are all put on hold for an entire episode . This may be how Dickens wrote the book ( I have n't read it for years ) but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward together.<br /><br />Finally , Smallweed 's role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous . His discovery of the new will , that triggers the final phase of the story , is also thrown away . It happens off screen.<br /><br />Despite all of this , it is still a very good production . Many of the performances are outstanding . Individual scenes are beautifully realised . Its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful . I would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book , had it not been for the 2005 production . In fact , I probably would n't be fully aware of its defects if I had n't seen how Andrew Davies did it better . I have been critical of Davies 's Jane Austen adaptations , but I have to admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens 's sprawling books.<br /><br />This is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybody 's time . Nonetheless , its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a cross - reference to the near - definitive 2005 version .
1 This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right . The plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book ( but really how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a film version first ? I know of only a few ) . < br /><br />I think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who have n't a clue about the story - did you actually SEE the series or did you just bag a BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in the newer version?<br /><br />The series captures the mood , pace , characters and plot - drivers ( cutting out the Dickensian flourishes which are n't needed and detract from a film treatment like the Turveydrop story , the Smallweed family dynamic and the extra lawyers - Tangle , Vholes etc are very truncated ) . The only omission that I wish had been kept was the Jellyby incident but as the first episode is already a trifle slow ( after the first episode the pace is perfect ) I can see it had to go . < br /><br />The only other criticism I have is that Jo 's death could have been more faithfully done . I can see that would have practically canonized Woodcourt and he 's kept a little more human for not having that scene but really I think Jo 's death is one of the most poignant points of the book and I missed it even though it always makes me cry.<br /><br />Has theowinthrop actually seen the series ? HOW did he think that Esther was raised by her aunt and UNCLE ? ? Who is this uncle ? I suppose someone who could mistake the name of DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond is n't really an appreciator of English art ( film or literature).<br /><br />I also think he mistakes the treatment of the law . YES the law is drawn VERY badly in Bleak House . It fails the descendants of Jarndyce whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of litigation , it fails the deceased Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all who have faith in the suit . It fails Miss Flyte . In some sense it also fails Captain Hawdon who is driven to his death by the monotony of law copyist work . Yes it feeds the scavengers of Vholes and Tangle . But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to move beyond their station in life . Though not kind to social status - climbers Dickens clearly would have preferred that they were n't bound to being stuck in the station to which they were born ( contrast Jo and the brickmakers ' families to the climbing out of poverty by Charley Neckett ) . < br /><br />Also , the law , while misused by Tulkinghorn and the Chancery vultures , is actually the source of security for the wards of the Court Ada and Richard , and for Esther who is simply Jarndyce 's ward . Their security was ensured by the law which delivers them to Jarndyce.<br /><br />I ca n't see how anyone could have trouble following the story - remember you are n't supposed to realize Esther is Lady Dedlock 's daughter right at the beginning . Neither are you supposed to " get " all the connections immediately . Instant gratification just does n't happen in Dickens.<br /><br />As for " seeing clearly " through the fog - gosh the Gillian Anderson had such scatty editing that I found IT impossible to follow and I knew the plot already!<br /><br />I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant ( overacting and drama do n't make a good Lady Dedlock but if you think they do try the Gillian Anderson version).<br /><br />It 's ADA and Rick not " Kate " ! and you get all you need of the Rouncewell subplot .
1 Perhaps you wo n't care for the social commentary , or the film makers point of view ( I myself am mystified at the insignificance ' angle Kasdan seemed to promote  when clearly , the actions taken in the movie promote CERTAIN significance . The ending confused me ) . However , there 's absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented ; the magnificent symbolism throughout ; the threaded character arcs ; visuals ; dialogue  is absolute masterwork . I 've watched the movie dozens of times , and I still marvel at its perfection . There 's not a moment , action , cut , or line that does n't have everything to do with the theme . Realistic human performances from all the actors . Scene to scene it 's woven fantastically.<br /><br />I have a pretty level sap - meter . The buzzer never went off during this film . If you 're a thinker ( rather than a casual viewer )  this movie delivers . Exponentially . Absolutely mesmerizing . ( Do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display ? Who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not , was it interesting?)<br /><br />Personally , the movie affected me  significantly . In my top 5.<br /><br />Note : The front - page reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed African American perception . What he may have failed to recognize , is , there was a hand  shake . Not a hand - out . The spiritually dead white man ' , simply saw a man to respect , and admire . And he did something about it . The fact he was black had little , if anything , to do with it ( color is simply used to draw the parallel . And the chasm . It 's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either ) . If you view the blacks in this movie as token '  you may want to reassess YOUR angst . You may be seeing only black and white yourself , eh . Just a thought .
1 I 'll keep this one quite short . I believe that this is an extraordinary movie . I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it 's badly written , poorly shot , has a terrible soundtrack and , worse , that it 's not real in its portrayal of life . OK , so it may not be quite believable for its whole length , but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed . Hope that it is n't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives . Gangland violence is real , right ? Is it right , no ! This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised , rather than denigrated . I have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times , each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving ( well not until 2008 anyway ) . 9 out of 10 from me for this one . It 's very nearly perfect in my view . JMV
1 This highly underrated film is ( to me ) what good writing in a movie should be all about . Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at . The movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life . < br /><br / > Along the way we are asked question after question about life . Davis ( Steve Martin with a great beard ) asks himself ' Is my making a violent movie ( and by extension our enjoyment of it ) causing the violence in society ? ' Claire asks " What kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life ? ' Mack is not immune as he asks ' Is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and ( an even harder step ) finance ? These are of course not quoted from the film , but generalities . Others ask their questions too , and to be honest it raises more than it answers.<br /><br / > But that is the nature of life . We strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer , and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires . As humans we thrive on questions we can not answer . Some answers are real . Claire and Mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby , their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands . Some answers are not . Davis ` Sees the Light ' and decides not to make violent films , but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art.<br /><br / > We all seek answers . This movie does not answer them for ; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers.<br /><br / >
1 On second viewing of this movie , I like it even more than the first time . It is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidences in our lives to which we normally only offer the briefest of attention spans . Here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences , the meeting of a tow truck driver and client , the jogger hearing a baby 's cry from the bushes . The dialogue , acting , casting and direction are superb . No two by fours , no grand revelations . What I did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated . Kudos to all involved in this , we need more " Grand Canyons " in our lives . 9 out of 10 .
1 One measurement for the greatness of a movie is , ' if it came on t.v . right now , would you want to sit there and watch it again ? ' My answer for the Grand Canyon is as powerful a " yes " as it would be for nearly any movie I have ever seen . There are just so many powerful moments , such an intelligent and moving story , such incredible performances . < br /><br / > It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties . But it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love , think and care . In a slight way , the movie was of its time . It partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst . Because the country was in a recession , and so void of leadership , this was true of that time . But the movie is also timeless . I think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made , and it is the most overlooked film of all time .
1 I really liked this film when it was released , and I still do , because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general , and people too ... one of the things I like about the films of Lawrence Kasdan . In addition to the positive vibes from the film , there are other reasons to like Grand Canyon . For one thing , it has an outstanding cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover , for example . In my opinion , Crash , the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture , was very similar to this film . The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive . Crash had the opposite effect with me ; it was very dark . I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day .
1 I have to say that Grand Canyon is one of the most affecting films I 've ever seen . I 've watched it several times now and I still feel as I did the first time ; that this film , by itself , could make up the entire curriculum of a post - graduate course in film direction . < br /><br />A long time ago film trailers used to promise , " It 'll make you laugh , it 'll make you cry . " That 's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what Grand Canyon does . It takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell . < br /><br />Much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror . It 's always a short step , too . Just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius.<br /><br />Spoiler ( of sorts ) coming up . After getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum , the film throws a curve with a sequence that does n't go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat , through an accidental self - inflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches , to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house . In the moment of their relief , argument forgotten , cut finger forgotten , the earthquake survived , a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed . The couple rushes to his aid . I cried when I saw this sequence . I cried every time I saw it . I 'm crying now . It is n't sadness that does this to me . It 's not a particularly sad sequence . What tears me up is that this few minutes of film was PERFECT . That 's PERFECT ! Astounding . ( end of spoiler)<br /><br />There 's so much to say about Grand Canyon . It portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously . They are n't showy or overblown and there 's no long pause to examine the moment carefully . The film moves on at the pace of life . Even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened , they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience . < br /><br />Grand Canyon is a very human film .
1 I just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just New Age pap . A great film , one that takes its time to develop , it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative , affecting , and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its " coincidences " can see . I was angry at the time that movies like " Prince of Tides " and " Bugsy " ( though I liked the latter ) were nominated for best picture that year ( let alone that " Silence of the Lambs " won ! ) and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay . Upon revisiting it , I think history supports my initial reaction !
1 I revisited Grand Canyon earlier this year when I set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990 's . I first saw the film when I was 17 years old . How did I hear about it ? It was reviewed , and recommended highly , by Siskel & Ebert in 1991 , and I eventually caught it on video a year later.<br /><br />It 's a great film , a powerful film , a healing film , about the power of listening , truly listening to one another . I 've seen it six times now , and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing . But why the poor reviews for this movie ? Maltin 's movie guide gives it two out of four . Too melodramatic , too much coincidence , too sappy , are the expressions that I read the most . Yes , there is melodrama in this story , and yes , there is a lot of coincidence , too . But it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple . For all of the " plot " that exists in Grand Canyon , such as drive - by shootings , a police chase , an earthquake , a love affair , a woman 's discovery of a baby in the bushes , another shooting , a near accident by a new driver , and worldly advice from a homeless man , this movie wins because of the smart performances by Kevin Kline , Steve Martin , Mary McDonnell , Alfre Woodard , Danny Glover , and Jeremy Sisto . It also succeeds because of Lawrence Kasdan 's skillful direction and writing . You know that this is n't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves Kevin Kline being harassed by four black youths . Danny Glover plays a tow truck driver who assists the Kline character , but not before he gets harassed too , by the leader of the bunch . Listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to Glover,"Are you afraid of me because of me , or because I have a gun?".<br /><br />Grand Canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another . Steve Martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind . I think his character is a warning that " the good " can carry us forward , that idealism is a virtue , but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon.<br /><br />I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non - new releases at the video store . But with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents , I plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it , Grand Canyon is something special . If you loved Magnolia , another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes , you 'll love Grand Canyon , too .
1 Grand Canyon falls under a very scarce category : it is a very clever film , with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end . I have the impression that it never made it to it 's deserved ranking ( and never will ) , because of it 's simplicity . This kind of flick needs sensitive watchers . Pity thought that IMDb makes me write ten lines , because this is in no way necessary in this particular case . Anyway in order to fulfill this request , I will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting : not that it is bad but it could have been done much better . Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect . Go ahead and watch it .
1 If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s ( in L.A. ) then you 've missed a special treat . This is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for Americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today 's world in which we live in . It covers everything from raising a child , prejudice ( more than one way),love , adultery , empty nest syndrome , selfishness , etc .. and the list goes on . This story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life . It helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life . Makes us ask questions of ourselves . Have we done enough for others , are we like this , etc . ? ? ? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that I 'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime.<br /><br />Take note of Mary Mcdonnell , Kevin Kline and Danny Glover 's wonderful performance through this whole film . These actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us . These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now . I still enjoy it again and again . Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and do n't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it 's symbolism for the movie??hmmm ... I almost forgot this is probably Steve Martin 's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done . He , too does an excellent job in this movie . This may come as a surprise to most of you . Sit back , relax and enjoy truly good film making .....
1 This work is less about Steve Martin 's character Davis , than it is about Kline ( Mack ) and Glover ( Simon ) , and Kline and McDonnell ( Claire ) , but the dialog inserted via Davis is pondering , contemplative , near - poetic existentialism at its best . He is witty , intelligent , and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content . The writers deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />The performances are easy , relaxed , and natural ; just what you would expect from " A List " actors . Martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent Shopgirl , guiding you through life , love , and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness . Kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film , and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing.<br /><br />This work deals with life in all aspects . It engenders a true emotional investment in its characters , and leaves you feeling hopeful that Mankind is not doomed , after all , no matter WHAT you believe , deep down.<br /><br />All in all ? This is delightful , with a gritty moment or two , and easy natural dialog which draws you in , assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work . It 's definitely worth your time , though it may not be every one 's top choice as Friday / Saturday night entertainment.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited . It 's not typical , and was an unexpected surprise . Another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein . The couples and friends hold detailed conversations , which feel and sound fully honest and ( again ) natural . I was very impressed with this work , and will be adding it to the DVD collection soon.<br /><br />It rates a 9.1/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
1 If you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the Hollywood scene " made it " to where they are , the vast majority will tell you ( assuming they will tell ) that a strange coincidence took place . They happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects . Quinten Tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew Harvey Keitel . Kevin Spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role . And Robin Williams credits his career to Gary Marshall 's son who , after having seen " Star Wars " , suggested to his father that an alien should visit the Cunninghams of " Happy Days " . These coincidences , many times viewed as pure luck , shapes many of the careers in Hollywood today . Or is it pure luck ? Is possible something else is going on ? " Grand Canyon " written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan , proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable , aka the strange miraculous coincidence . The movie concerns several different characters whose lives intersect because of positive and yet inexplicable happenstance.<br /><br />Kevin Kline , a middle - aged father , experiences a break - down in one of the more dangerous areas of LA . After he phones a tow truck , a young gang accosts him . They threaten violence if he does n't leave his car . Just before the confrontation can escalate , Danny Glover appears as the tow truck driver and dampens the intentions of the gang . Although Glover denies it later , he probably saved Kline 's life . A producer ( Steve Martin ) of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience . He then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment . And Kline 's wife , Clair ( Mary McDonnell ) , while on a morning jog , finds a baby hidden in some foliage . She claims the baby cried for her and that her " rescue " of the infant was preordained.<br /><br />The movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships , end to relationships , and new beginnings . And all the while , a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going on.<br /><br />It is very rare in Hollywood , or for film in general , to explore such a purely esoteric subject . There are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable , but maybe that 's the point . What makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast . Although the miracles and coincidences may seem far - fetched , the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities . Maybe this is a subject we should explore more often .
1 A lot of the comments people have made strike me as ( sorry ) missing the point . Kasdan wants to present life , simply , ordinary life . The conventionally structured story , where characters have insights that change their lives , and then fade out , music up , and the film is over , is absorbed into this much larger canvas . Several characters in this movie have just such illuminations , and then they move on . Sometimes they can hold onto their insights , sometimes they ca n't , and that 's the way life really is . In other words , Kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life  there is no happy ending , only an eventual ending ; and everything before that is still in process , still always up for grabs  and , if you absolutely insist on a theme , an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives . What is a miracle ? Well , life itself , for a start . Then add in all the random incidents and cross - connections that make up a life , or several interconnected lives , and you have miracles by the bucketful . Kasdan underscores this theme lightly , rather than insisting on it , and bolsters it in various ways , most memorably by the device , right in the center of the film , of having Mac and his wife , lying in bed , each dreaming their own dreams , but as well showing , later on in the film , how those dreams have the power , within the film , to shape reality . This is not a film with an easy or obvious message . You just have to let it play out in front of you , and then let it sit in your mind for a few days , a month , a few years , and see what it has wrought there . This is , without a doubt , Kasdan 's best film , his most mature , his most humane . A major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors . The tragedy is , of course , that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now , mostly due to studio constraints around " Dreamcatcher . " Hopefully we have n't heard the last from Larry Kasdan . A great film from a great artist . Keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself completely in order to succeed .
1 Before there was Crash , there was this interesting film called Grand Canyon . Released about 14 years sooner than the former film , Grand Canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime . To me Crash was still a slightly better film , but Grand Canyon was no slouch either.<br /><br />Taking place in Los Angeles , an upper - class lawyer named Mack ( Kevin Kline ) takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time . He calls for a tow truck , and has to wait for awhile , only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car . Soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment , and out steps Simon ( Danny Glover ) to take the truck away . Both men are threatened , but Simon manages to get himself , Mack , and the car out of dire straits . It is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with Mack helping out Simon just as Simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier . You see Simon 's sister Deborah ( Tina Lifford ) is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children , and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people . Mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking Simon up with his secretary 's friend Jane ( Alfre Woodard).<br /><br />This is the main plot of the film , but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above ( Mary Louise Parker ) as well as Mack 's wife , ( Mary McDonnel ) who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son Roberto ( Jeremy Sisto in his first movie role ) has gone to camp for the summer , and will likely be moving on with his own life soon . The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes . This simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story.<br /><br />The director Lawrence Kasdan , whose biggest movie to this date was The Big Chill , has created a splendid movie here . The cast is excellent , and most of the ideas are well thought out , but alas it falls short of greatness because some points , that would 've made the film even stronger , are glossed over . The story involving the secretary is one , and the second involving Simon 's nephew is the other . These scenes should 've been more apart of the entire story , and then maybe Lawrence Kasdan 's views of life between the upper and lower classes would 've been more on a superior level instead of just very good . Still Grand Canyon exceeded expectations , and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after . There is also a small role for Steve Martin as Davis , a producer of violent films , who offers his own views on life , and has a small part to play in this movie 's ideas .
1 Well , maybe not immediately before the Rodney King riots , but even a few months before was timely enough . My parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know , the police got acquitted and LA got burned to the ground . It just goes to show the state of race relations in America . The plot has white Mack ( Kevin Kline ) and African - American Simon ( Danny Glover ) becoming friends after Simon saves Mack 's life in the black ghetto . Meanwhile , movie producer Davis ( Steve Martin in a serious role ) thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool ... until he gets shot . There 's also some existentialism in the movie : Mack and his family come to realize that they are n't living as they really want.<br /><br />It seems that " Crash " has somewhat renewed people 's interest in race relations , but this one came out much earlier . Maybe we 'll never be able to have stable race relations in this country . But either way , " Grand Canyon " is a great movie . It affirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor . Also starring Mary McDonnell , Mary - Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard .
1 The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film . To me this substantiates Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another . I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon . The major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release . I 'm not going to argue which one is better , but I will contend to the idea that they share the same message . I 'd love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject . I will start a commentary which you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249 . You may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share , because i have a true love for film .
1 Grand Canyon is a very strange bird . It 's a completely unique urban piece , where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much.<br /><br />It 's central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race , background and station . But to proclaim that THE theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope . Similarly , to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile.<br /><br />The film has volumes to say , though likely different volumes for every viewer , and says it all in such a non - preachy way from so many angles , that in the end , i ca n't even define its central message for myself.<br /><br />Nevertheless , it does it 's business with such laser precision ; every prop , line of dialog , and bar of background music contributing to it 's pervasive mood and powerful message , that i 'm pleasantly surprised , and come away very thoughtful after every viewing . Still it does n't feel at all stuffy . A sparkling film with a great cast and everything working .
1 I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7 ; and at the time it shocked me . I had seen a violent movie before , but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence . This movie not only shows this , but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness . What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful . Crash tried to show how racism was bad ( and Crash actually had a built - in anti Asian bias ) and to come at it from a morally superior position . Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash . Especially when you compare the endings . The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up . While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note , where you know nothing much will change in the character 's lives but that 's because life just goes on too , there 's no suitable ending . No matter how good ... bad you are . There is no ending of a chapter to begin another .
1 This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting . I never tire of watching it . I especially love the scene where Danny Glover 's character and Kevin Kline 's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together . Kevin Kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often . SO its a very ' real ' movie . < br /><br />One of the most powerful scenes in the movie however , is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack 's car has broken down . The movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there 's one person preaching his guts out to an audience . Instead the actors ' emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words . And lastly , Mary McDonell is brilliant as always .
1 ... but watch Mary McDonnell 's performance closely . Her body language . Her fine body movements . Her subtle , but powerfully effective , reactions . This is an accomplished artist at the top of her craft . And the rest of the cast were pretty damned good , too ! ; o)<br /><br />This is perhaps the 3rd or 4th viewing for me , and I see more in it each time . What /IS/ this world coming to , anyway ? -R.
1 In my opinion , the best movie ever . I love when people ask me what this film is about . I usually smile and say " life " . They shrug and probably never give it another thought . The fact that everyone from every background can relate to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing . Definately a must see for everyone .
1 This film could well have been one of those ordinary " soapies " relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined  .. broken relationships , building new friendships , street bashings , near accidents , hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes ! What a mixture of events!<br /><br />Fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers . He asks  in this chaotic world do things just happen , is it just luck when things turn out right or , taking a fatalistic view , is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective ? Most of us have had this uncanny experience.<br /><br />Is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important ? As one character says   he once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was.<br /><br />This is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships . Danny Glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role .
1 At your video store , you might find this gem.<br /><br />The human condition in modern times LA . No exaggerated drama , just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time.<br /><br />Helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life.<br /><br />The direction and cutting are top class . Cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation . And the CAST ! ! ! < br /><br />Excellent casting and excellent acting . No one out of place or out of character.<br /><br />And it 's NOT really as much a downer as you would expect . I gave it 7 of 10.<br /><br />If you have nt seen it , DO !
1 This movie awed me so much that I watch it at least once a year . At times I find it uncomfortable . At times I find it empowering . And I always find the characters human and real . It is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in LA , starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters . It is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference . Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take , whether intended or not , has powerful repercussions . I found this movie to be similar in many ways to Robert Altman 's film Short Cuts . Both had a star - studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other , for better or worse . Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message , ( hope in the face of despairing reality ) , than Altman 's film , although I found them both intriguing in their own way . This film is a definite must see ! ! !
1 Every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human . Lawrence Kasden done this again . I always felt theBg Cill was the anthem of it 's age and he has managed to do it again in Grand Canyon . Every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it . This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice . The juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius . I have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film . Danny Glover and Kevin Kline do their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless . Thank you again Mr. Kasden
1 This would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991 , except it got beat out by the brilliant JFK . This is such a wonderful movie ! I loved it . I love stories where different characters ' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives . Kevin Kline is good here , but is outshined by Danny Glover and , especially , Steve Martin . I 've never much like Martin or his style , but here he is great . I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end about the Grand Canyon . The writing was excellent . Larry Kasdan is , IMO , a great dialogue writer , along the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino . Here , he has formed several three - dimensional characters and well thought out storylines , and messages that give a positive feel to our lives . A truly excellent film . 4 out of 4 stars
1 Alain Chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old , if not older , than Shakespeare.<br /><br />Chabat is a " vieux garcon " , happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life . He has a problem , 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - the G7 - who decide he should be married . Enter the delightful , charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan . Charlotte has to pose as Chabat 's girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding . No more talk of marriage from the G7 . Of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control.<br /><br />There are very strong supporting roles from Lafont as the mother and Osterman as the tight - fisted brother of Gainsbourg.<br /><br />There are some fantastic scenes as first Charlotte has to charm , then revolt the family . French farce with an English .
1 There was n't a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema , having seen this gem of a film in a sold - out house as part of this year 's Hamburg Film Festival . And the tears shed were all of laughter . This film was hilarious , there 's no other way of saying this . There was n't one boring bit in it , I laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of French cinéma.<br /><br />Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific . A great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it . The performance was of course completely over the top , but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well . Equally great was Charlotte Gainsbourg who I love to see a lot , and the mother was also a very strong performance . The sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script - wise , but apart from that there is nothing to moan about . I had a great afternoon seeing this film while Hamburg was drowning in rain outside , and I wish films like this from France would get a regular release in Germany . But the distributors is this country do n't seem to understand that the French make good films . I at least ca n't wait to find a DVD which offers subtitles ( Hello Australia ? Please ? ) because that film I need at home to watch several more times !
1 Alain Chabat is a fine actor , writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an ' idea ' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when Aristophanes was still learning that it 's ' i ' before ' e ' except after ' c ' . But , like I said , Chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to . I 'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance . If you absolutely insist on knowing , the ' plot ' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single . This does n't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an ' arrangement ' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend , allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him , thus getting him off the hook . Naturally they wind up together but along the way there 's some sub - Benedek and Beatrice duelling and all things considered it 's a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the French box office that a sequel may not be out of the question .
1 Did n't know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the " no expectation " factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than I anticipated.<br /><br />The setting was interesting , strange but interesting . The storyline had gaps / jumps that I think throws the audience off a bit . There 's no great soundtrack playing in the background , creating the " romantic " ambiance . BUT they all did n't matter.<br /><br />The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite . There was some inexplicable strange chemistry that I could n't resist ; I fell in love with it and here I am , writing this review . The subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb , and I believe , that is the core of this movie.<br /><br />This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy ; in fact , not all of us will appreciate it . I had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things I did n't catch at first . I can not guarantee everyone will like it , but I hope YOU do .
1 From the opening shots of the lead actor , we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them , and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of ' normal ' life.<br /><br />Eric Lartigau , the director picks up on how so many European men feel that they are in complete control of their lives , yet without the help / support of the women around them can not seem to make things work . The use of facial image throughout the film is superb , and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family ( mother ) is spot on.<br /><br />While there are more than enough laughs in the movie , it still deals with single parents / adoption and the strength of family in society . Truly rewarding to watch , and again one that only the French seam capable to make.<br /><br />So far one of the best 50 or so Films I have seen this year , and well worth a five start rating . I look forward to adding this one to the DVD collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages .
1 I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world . I ca n't understand why some people say she 's not . Boring .... ? ? ? Maybe the one who said she 's boring is because he / she is boring . She 's a great actress and the movie was excellent . It has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers . The direction was great . I imaging myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and perfume , flowers , churches , problems , etc . When she goes to the sister 's shop is simply amazing . Everything 's great . We have a very good actress , wonderful , for long time . Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect . I like him more than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÊVES . And Eric Lartigau did a very good work.<br /><br />Ana
1 I have to be 100 % honest with you fellow IMDb users . I wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster . Does n't Charlotte Gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way ? I 'm in love with that woman ! I got what I expected ... but only half . This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations.<br /><br />While I do n't agree with another fellow IMDb user who states that the movie is overrated ; I must admit that " Préte - moi ta main " has plenty of flaws.<br /><br />My main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters . There is n't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment " of romance " or even a clue to suggest that they 're interested in each other.<br /><br />In fact , the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward ( when both are in the couch ) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest . I did n't buy the dinner sequence.<br /><br />Still , the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise . I mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days.<br /><br />I understand it 's a movie and that 's why I accept it as a funny situation . Plus , the humor is versatile . There are moments involving S&M , funny lines with Chabat 's best friend , some lesbian references , funny situations involving the family women , and more.<br /><br />Charlotte Gaionsbourg 's performance is top notch and she 's by far the reason to watch the movie . She 's funny , sexy , looks very thin and fine , and demonstrates she 's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Alain Chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance . I think the supporting cast do what they can.<br /><br />The score , art direction , and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film.<br /><br />Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits . It 's a good example of feel good cinema .
1 Rain or shine outside , you enter a movie house . It makes you happy . ( If not , come right out . ) Lights go off . You settle down with a bar of ice cream . Moving pictures begin to flicker on the screen . You feel content . In the dark , you are back in the beginning of time . Sitting around the campfire ... looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the scenario with rest of your clan / spectators.<br /><br />Those who are not happy with themselves , should not write comments . ( Long live romantic comedies ... )

1 I saw this film ( it 's English title is " Who 's Singing Over There ? " ) at the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival . It won raves then ... and disappeared . A terrible shame . It is brilliant . Sublime , ridiculous , sad , and extremely funny . The script is a work of art . It 's been 19 years and I 've seen only a handful of comedies ( or any other genre , for that matter ) that can match its originality .
1 This " tragicomedy " written by famous Serbian theatre / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category . And yet , its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value . A masterpiece one should not miss to see ( preferably with subtitles , and not dubbed).<br /><br />In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade , a looming war decides the passengers ' behaviour . Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come ; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie ( real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors , but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who 's plowed the road give a real - life performance).<br /><br />The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war , an insight into nation 's collective person : everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can , hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy . Using a simple movie language , director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war ( World War I ) , but also highlights personal portraits with success : provincialism of a singer , inexperience of the newlyweds , seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son , and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy.<br /><br />Brilliant in its narration , with memorable soundtrack ( especialy the Gispsy songs ) and adjusted atmosphere , well photographed and edited , this feature ( Sijan 's feature debut ) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter - sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s : " Maratonci trce pocasni krug " , " Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota " , and my other director 's favourite " Davitelj protiv davitelja " ) .
1 This movie is one of the funniest , saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the Balkans yet again , 45 years after the time depicted . All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger , sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response . The accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types , however , make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex - Yugoslavia to its madness . In fact , no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie , and its twin , * Maratonci trce pocasni krug . * Did I mention it is one of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ?
1 A milestone in Eastern European film making and an outstanding example of Serbian mentality . A group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord . With " Maratonci trce pocasni krug " makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word .
1 Superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit , absurdness and Serbian mentality . Movie is a great comedy , enjoyable , interesting , unpredictable . Best point in a film : characters , then humor itself , story and dialogs . Humor has ' inner development ' , rare in Serbian movies . So , it is consequence of characterization , is well motivated , spontaneous and cogent . Also it is sharp , intelligent and lucid . Most of the movies , unfortunately , had constructed humor ( devise a joke and put it into a characters 's mouth ) or ordinary situation comedy , burlesque , farce . Some of the ' art immortality ' are incorporated in this movie . Little masterpiece , hardly reachable .
1 One of my favourite " domestic " movies . I do n't know if there is any person in our country who has n't seen this movie ! It 's funny , and sad at some moments ... I do n't know how did people around the world ( who had opportunity to watch it ) accept this movie , because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of Serbs in the first half of the 20th century , to be able to understand it ! But as I see here , there is somebody from Canada who watched it ... and he liked it.<br /><br />I think that I 'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site , but first to find out how to do that ... <br /><br />Cheers .
1 The group of people are travelling to Belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son ( who likes to drive with his eyes closed ) . Their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation`s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes . The man who " steals the show " is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him . In the end , the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country .

1 This is the movie I 've seen more times than any other ( I believe I saw it on average once every year since it was released ) . And every time I see it , it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me . The cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex Yu cinematography . This movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover . In the same league : Maratonci trce pocasni krug , Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu . This is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection .
1 " Ko to tamo peva " is one of the best films I ever saw . A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God - forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II . I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution , and I had no chance to come across it ever since . It is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now . I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times , and alas - could find none . I would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie - making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy .
1 At first sight , Who 's Singing Over There just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy   with only a kind of unusual , quiet and slow motion : what a mistake ! < br /><br />Beginning with two singers on a desert landscape , then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors , it hides a gem ! < br /><br />The folded story , and a false rhythm induces you to think , yes it is comic , but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie . < br /><br />Not at all : very funny by instant , dark subtle cynical on others , its development surprises you all along the story   Very ingeniously and cleverly presented , all the characters are important , and the actors give them full life.<br /><br />And what is astonishing , it 's based on deep observation , great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings , and really everything , the general direction and how also the details are presented , that it simply makes you forget it 's a movie : it is like to watch a kind human society , you yet do n't know , shot by a friend behind a camera.<br /><br />And you 're the one behind him . It is simple , and simply exceptional ! < br /><br />Don't misunderstand me ; in no way that would means the script , the quality of picture , the music score have a kind of amateurish way , no , no ! It 's great Art ! < br /><br />Because it flows like a river   From high up in the mountain , down to the sea , with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea   from a tiny thing to a main stream.<br /><br />This metaphoric image I used is the very best way I can find to explain all the charm that has Who 's Singing Over There . For me , again , I take the hammer : simply exceptional ... <br /><br />I've seen that The Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir , which I know is quiet famous   But as I yet did n't see it , I had no idea about this gentleman.<br /><br />Others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film , I fully agree ! < br /><br />European Eastern Cinema is not well know because seldom translated , but I am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language , with good English subtitles . All in all : deep , delicious and exceptional ... <br /><br />For fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs , avoid it at any cost , it may be too subtle and good for you ! < br /><br />But if you 're interested in different genres and/or classics , I guess you wo n't regret this one , and in case of buying , it will have good companionship in your personal DVD library , with such no less than merited big names like Billy Wilder , Lubitsch , or Sacha Guitry among some of my preferred directors . At least for this movie ! < br /><br />***A film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles * * *
1 Actually I 'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie . I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American University . But nobody in USA has heard of it , which is a real shame ! The dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad . They are stuck together on a long bus trip -- someplace most of us have been ! ! But I never had one like this ! ! < br /><br />My favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral . Then the man & woman sneak off for some Lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing ! Just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way -- the consumptive starts hacking & they realize everybody is watching ! ! Talk about surprised ! But ... you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny ! When you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did ! Serb humor at it 's best !
1 I like this movie a lot , but it 's a fact , that you can not understand it , unless you 're from the ex Yugoslavia . Most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex Yugoslavia . I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection . Macedonia . Serbia . Montenegro . Bosnia and Herzegowina . Croatia . Slovenia.<br /><br />All of this was ex Yugoslavia , a melting pot of the Balcan nations . It could be a dream land , if Slobodan Milosevic , Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would n't poison the nation 's mind with their sick ideas .
1 I watched this film over a hundred times . It is really best Serbian movie made ever . I wood like to recommend this movie to everyone . It is very good comedy . I surely like it ! ! ! !
1 this is what i call a great movie . it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story . there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic . but the main theme is very cruel , like live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country ( jugoslavia ) on their way to the capital Belgrad . the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way , connect the people and the pigs that travel together . < br /><br />watch it and you gon na remember it for life ... its filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle.<br /><br />and another reason for its magic : it is hard to get ! !
1 This is the best movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I've seen the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 ( ? ) .<br /><br />That month they were showing a Yugoslavian movie every Sunday night.<br /><br />The next week there was another great movie ( involving a train , rather than a bus ) the name of which I do n't remember . If you know it , please let me know ! In any case , how can I get to see this movie again ? ? ? ? A DVD of this movie , where ? ? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl<br /><br />The next week there was another great movie ( involving a train , rather than a bus ) the name of which I do n't remember .

1 Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times . Believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it . But truth is that the humour in this comedy is special . It is caratherisic for serbia . And all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well ! ! ! So i think the rest of audience ( for example : In Europe)can't enjoy it so much . Because the subtitles ruin the hole thing . But they should at least try ! ! ! ! Yes it is ironic ! This is the best flick in Serbian history and the world does n't understand it ! :-) If you have got a chance to see this one , do n't blew up OK !
1 Along with the " Maratonci trce pocasni krug " from the same director , one of the masterpieces of ex - Yugoslavia comedies . If you want to understand Serbian mentality , you must see this movie . And if you want to see several of ex - Yugoslav great actors at the same time , this is a opportunity .
1 i 'm not sure if it is available worldwide - but if anyone who 's deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs - is reading this - please , please buy it ! ( if I was n't clear : GET THE MOVIE INTO VIDEOSTORES!)<br /><br />can't be explained - must see !
1 During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn , WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ? was finally unearthed for a screening . It is amazing that a motion picture , from any era , that has Weill - Gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens . The score stands tall , and a CD of the material , with Gershwin and Weill , only underscores its merits , which are considerable . Yes , the film has its problems , but the score is not one of them . Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy , and Fred MacMurray can not quite grasp the material . Then , too , the ' modern ' segment is weakly written . BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark , as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver . Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work . As a World War II salute to our country 's history - albeit in a ' never was ' framework , the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits .
1 First saw this half a lifetime ago on a black - and - white TV in a small Samoan village and thought it was hilarious . Now , having seen it for the second time , so much later , I do n't find it hilarious . I do n't find ANYTHING hilarious anymore . But this is a witty and light - hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />It 's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F who 's dying to get into one of the armed forces . He rubs a lamp in the scrapyard he 's managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes . ( Ho hum , right ? But though the introduction is no more than okay , the fantasies are pretty lively . ) MacMurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army . Poof , and he is marching along with Washington 's soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting USO where June Haver and Joan Leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are , and lavender wigs . Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy -- red - coating , German - speaking Hessians , not Brits . The Hessians are jammed into a Bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the Vaterland , " where the white wine is winier/ and the Rhine water 's Rhinier/ and the bratwurst is mellower/ and the yellow hair is yellower/ and the Frauleins are jucier/ and the goose steps are goosier . " Something like that . The characterizations are fabulous , as good as Sig Rumann 's best . Otto Preminger is the suspicious and sinister Hessian general . " You know , Heidelberg , vee are 241 to 1 against you -- but vee are not afraid . " < br /><br />I ca n't go on too long with these fantasies but they 're all quite funny , and so are the lyrics . When he wishes he were in the Navy , MacMurray winds up with Columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera . " Do n't you know that sailing west meant/ a terrifically expensive investment?/ And who do you suppose provides the means/ but Isabella , Queen of Queens . " When they sight the New World , someone remarks that it looks great . " I do n't care what it looks like , " mutters Columbus , " but that place is going to be called Columbusland." < br /><br />Anyway , everything is finally straightened out , though the genie by this time is quite drunk , and MacMurray winds up in the Marine Corps with the right girl.<br /><br />I've made it sound too cute , maybe , but it IS cute . The kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story . The adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story ( who are the Hessians ? ) unless they happen to be college graduates , in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say , " Wow ! Awesome ! "
1 If you have n't seen this obscure little charmer , you should seek it out . It is the story of a bumbling , wartime Sad Sack ( Fred MacMurray ) who is listed 4-F each time he attempts to join any branch of the military . He finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie ( Gene Sheldon ) , but the genie is even more bumbling than MacMurray is , sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants . It is cute , cheerful , and pure fluff , and you ca n't help but like it . The plots is much like a Disney film , particularly since the two stars ( MacMurray and Sheldon ) both made numerous Disney films in the 50 's and 60 's , although not together . Needless to say , it all ends well for everyone , and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good .
1 I happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made ! WWII had freshly ended and the so - called " Cold War " was about to begin . This movie could , therefore , be defined as one of the best " propaganda " , patriotic movies preparing Americans and , secondly , people from the still to be formed " Western NATO block " of countries to face the next coming menace . The movie celebrates the might of the US , through the centuries , while projecting itself onwards to the then present war , which had just ended . Nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the American Continent by Columbus and pretty the " espisode " of New Amsterdam and the purchasing of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian .. Must see it ( at least once , for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time ) ! :)
1 During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn , WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ? was finally unearthed for a screening . It is amazing that a motion picture , from any era , that has Weill - Gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens . The score stands tall , and a CD of the material , with Gershwin and Weill , only underscores its merits , which are considerable . Yes , the film has its problems , but the score is not one of them . Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy , and Fred MacMurray can not quite grasp the material . Then , too , the ' modern ' segment is weakly written . BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark , as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver . Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work . As a World War II salute to our country 's history - albeit in a ' never was ' framework , the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits .
1 Saw it as many times as I could before it left the scene . A delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars . Only wish I could find it again ! Would certainly buy / view it if I could . Please , somebody , bring it back . Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II , and his leading ladies , Joan Leslie , and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming . It was a musical , but also romantic , funny , and clever . This was my favorite movie starring June Haver , although I always liked her . Her dazzling smile lit up the screen , and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film . The supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles . A well - balanced and light - hearted film ; only wish we had more like it !
1 I adored this movie . Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu , although he is in practically all German movies that count . But also because he is NOT the main actor . The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat , who was the only reason to watch 2001 's Julietta , and who really carries this movie on his shoulders.<br /><br />A family moves from Italy to Germany seeking " the German dream " ( this is my own invention and ironic ... ) of cheap labor in steel and coal industries . However , they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming . From this point onward , the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family , Giancarlo ( Bleibtreu ) and Gigi ( Metschurat ) . Gigi 's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother 's determination to return to Italy . What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the choices you make.<br /><br />In the end , this movie does n't say which life ( Gigi 's or Giancarlo 's ) was more successful or fuller or more interesting . It merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved . and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country , which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration . The fact that director Fatih Akin 's moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy . The icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast , especially Metschurat and - this I really need to stress - the little boy who plays young Gigi . That kid 's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone ! Great movie , go see it .
1 After Fatih Akins first work " I m Juli " , which was fairly good , he created a really gorgeous italian family epic . Its a german movie , which is unfortunately a bad precondition , cause we rareley produce more than moderate movies ;) . But this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then . " Solino " is about a Italian immigrant who arrives in the " Ruhr " region of Germany during the 60s . The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region . The characters are excellent drawn . Especially Gigi , the main actor . You live every second , every feeling he does . His brother , played by Moritz Bleibtreu , is nt that good . Well , you just do nt believe him the role . But the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script . I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of " The Godfather " . Many people will probably hate this movie , say its boring . Not much tension ? - yes , but an outrageous movie . 9 out of 10 .
1 Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters . While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers , it was not simply about hate or jealousy . What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into . To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating . Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave . And as in real life , most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children . I could even identify with Giancarlo , the brother , who while being the more self assured and elder brother , had so many insecurities . A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry .
1 This film plays in the 60s and is about an Italian family : Romano , his wife Rosa and their two children Gigi and Giancarlo emigrate from Solino in Italy to Duisburg in the Ruhr area . I like this film , because I think it is quite realistic : it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country : they have to get used to a new culture , a new environment and this can be difficult : especially if you do n't know the language .... It is difficult for the family but they find a way : they open a restaurant which offers typical Italian food , and it is named " Solino " , like their hometown . The film also shows different conflicts - Gigi and Giancarlo fall in love with the same girl , and although Rosa has to work very hard , Romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers , etc . etc . But stop , I do n't want to tell you how it goes on . You should watch the film yourself , it 's a nice one - I have also made a Referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes . And there are a few ...
1 This movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great!<br /><br />It is n't an idealistic movie , I would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place . The characters are very nice but have also some " dark " sides , what makes you believe that these are real persons . Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time , but that you can find happiness with " fire and passion " as the main character Gigi would say .
1 Such a delightful movie ! Very heart warming . One ca n't help falling in love with the character of Gigi . He 's adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist . The whole movie revolves around him . He lives in a wonderful world  living all life  curiosity , desire and anticipation . There is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life . The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is the mother . I wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene  and have them cry and laugh . I also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother . His personality seems to have been trashed entirely . Passion and ardour  that 's the key to life . And looking through the camera  focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life .
1 I really enjoyed this movie . The script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding . It is a down - to - earth movie with characters one cares about . It brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards .

1 really excellent movie , one of the best i 've seen . Touching and simple - just like life , sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it 's just beautiful . not too much of anything , just as it 's suppose to be . Really loved the idea of the movie , noone is bad or good , all or just people , sometimes make mistakes mostly because of society 's pressure , everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you do n't have reasons to get angry - you can do it , but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although it 's hard , there lies the true happiness.<br /><br />Great actors and cast , the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie.<br /><br />nice nice nice.<br /><br />I recommend to see it , especially if you like to see italians ' life ...
1 this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end . it has a very humane story and very good selected music . The acting of Moritz Bleibtreu ( Giancarlo Amato ) and Barnaby Metschurat ( Gigi Amato ) is satisfying . Recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie .
1 I liked SOLINO very much . It is a very heart - rending story of an italian family moving to Germany . And it 's an story about brotherly love , hope and disappointment . And the film is never boring . Go and see SOLINO !
1 Todd Rohal is a mad genius . " Knuckleface Jones " , his third , and most fully realized , short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads . What the film is about at heart , and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this , is how a regular Joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration . Or not . You just have to see for yourself . The short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit , so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - you 'll be glad you did . It is hilarious . And check out Todd 's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time : " Single Spaced " and " Slug 660 " .
1 Whether it 's three guys in their tighty - whiteys rapping to a dude bound in twine or a girl saying " What up , dog ? " to a lump of roadkill , there 's something please everyone in Knuckleface Jones . It is strange and surreal and not altogether a completely comprehensible yarn ... yet it never loses you . The first time I saw it , I nearly laughed myself sick . And every night after I would come home and watch it again . Forget Coyote Ugly ... this is the movie that cemented my crush on Piper Perabo . See it ... before it 's too late !
1 there is a story , but more essentially , the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes.<br /><br />it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good . representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema , this film should be taught in every high school.<br /><br />*CHIASMUS *
1 THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York City knowing exactly what she wants : to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity . With her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon , but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love?<br /><br />Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy . With her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments , she is a dazzler . But her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress . She has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the Hollywood pantheon.<br /><br />An excellent cast gives Harlow fine support : Lionel Barrymore as the wily old tycoon , wise to Harlow 's ways ; handsome Franchot Tone as his son , smitten with love ; raucous Patsy Kelly , stealing her scenes as Harlow 's sidekick ; debonair Alan Mowbray , as a well - mannered English Lord ; elderly Clara Blandick as Barrymore 's feisty secretary ; hearty Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies ; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who catches Kelly 's flirtatious eye ; and Lewis Stone , unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman.<br /><br />It should be noted that this film was produced soon after Hollywood 's Production Code was instituted . A comparison with RED - HEADED WOMAN , made two years earlier , would be fascinating - in which Harlow 's character goes after the same ends , but uses very different means .
1 In this film , made JUST as the production code was being enforced , Jean Harlow is Eadie , and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking , man - chasing sidekick " Kitty " . Girl from Missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train , with Eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband , staying whole - some in the process . It does n't take her long to meet up with Frank Cousins , ( Lewis Stone , was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel , as well as Judge Hardy in the " Andy Hardy " films . ) , but all is not as it seems ... The censors must have LOVED Harlow 's line " A girl could n't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged . " Later , someone says " You know we 've never been alone together " and Eadie replies " Yeah , and we 're not going to be ! " Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige , another rich , uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie . At one point , Paige declares " You oughta scratch me off your list - I 'm not a ladies man " .... I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town . What was he really saying ? Carol Tevis seems to be the high - pitched " Baby Talker " as listed in the credits on IMDb . Looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 - 1939 , with " Munchkin " in Wizard of Oz being the last part she played . Fun , cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country . Look for Nat Pendleton as the lifeguard , who was an Olympic Wrestler 1920 ( silver medal winner ) turned film star ( he was in many of the Dr. Kildares , and would appear in four of Harlow 's films . ) Mistaken identity , plot twists , a young Franchot Tone , love stories , even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit in " Palm Beach " , although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop .
1 If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar it should . That 's because Anita Loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes . Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that film , Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means.<br /><br />And it 's men of means that Jean Harlow is after . She leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she 's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it . Her talents as a chorus girl are limited , but she 'll be able to trade in on that beauty.<br /><br />Her odyssey starts with her and friend Patsy Kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire Lewis Stone . But unbeknownst to Jean , Stone 's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns . Still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore notices . < br /><br />Lionel 's amused by it until Jean sets her sights on his playboy son , Franchot Tone . After that he is not amused and he looks to shake Jean from climbing the family tree.<br /><br />The Girl From Missouri went into production mid adaption of The Code so it went under peculiar censorship . I 've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film . Still Jean Harlow as a younger and sassier version of Mae West is always appreciated . What a great comic talent that woman had , seeing The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later.<br /><br />Ironically enough the casting of Patsy Kelly with Harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts Kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde , Thelma Todd . Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between that Patsy had with Thelma . Todd would also die a year later in a freak accident / suicide / homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given . < br /><br />Don't miss The Girl From Missouri , it 's bright and sassy , must be from all that sparkling jewelry .
1 This film has slipped through the cracks of film history . It is by far much better than some other New York films of the same era such as : " The French Connection " or " The Taking of Pelham 1 - 2 - 3 " . There is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line . It 's engaging from start to finish and has n't tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples.<br /><br />Ron Liebman turns in a bravura performance as " Batman " and it 's a shame his career did n't take off as a result of this project.<br /><br />Gordon Parks directs and , coming as it does after " Shaft " , it at first appears to be a strange choice . Yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film has not been made available on either DVD or VHS in the United States . United Artists really has a gem on their hands and it 's a shame they 're not doing anything with it .
1 Gordon Parks , the prolific black Life magazine photographer , made a true ticking - timebomb of a movie here - one that does not mess around ! Based upon the true story of two NYC cops - later dubbed Batman and Robin - who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs , this is a cop - buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula . Lightning paced , there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here.<br /><br />Man , early ' 70s NYC must have been a terrible place to be a police officer , from the looks of movies like this and " Serpico . " These two cops start out as safety - division rookies , busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time . But instead of receiving applause from the city police department , they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers . They have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption , boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets , ruthless drug kingpins , and a nasty ghetto neighborhood.<br /><br />Both David Selby and Ron Leibman are fantastic in the leads ; part of the entertainment is watching Leibman 's eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance , and Selby 's acting is low - key and wry . These two make all the comedy aspects of the story work - displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination . Director Parks , who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography , does not shy away from the grittiness of the story . Rather , the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit . Adding to this realism is the fact that the real Hantz and Greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film , and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists . It is a real tribute to the effectiveness of Parks ' direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy.<br /><br />Why has MGM / UA let this sit on the shelf for 30 years - barely giving it a home video or DVD release in the U.S ? It is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s .
1 I read the book and saw the movie . Both excellent . The movie is diamond among coals during this era . Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw . This film should have made them stars . Shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film . It could have easily been a franchise . Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film . Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed , no matter how late , watch it . You wo n't be disappointed . Do yourself another favor - read the book ( same title ) . It 'll blow you away . Times have changed dramatically since those days , or at least we like to think they have .
1 I loved this movie ! ! ! The characters were people that you could feel for . The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind . Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life . The looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well . The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together . The most touching scene however , was the young couple at his great grandfather 's house . I laughed in parts , cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie . In fact I 've re - watched it about 5 times . A definite must see for total romantics .
1 The arch title does n't fit this gentle romantic comedy . Donna Reed and Tom Drake do n't have much chemistry -- but their characters are n't supposed to . Both are extremely likable and attractive.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a dream -- with the exception of Sig Ruman 's annoying faux Russian .
1 My observations : Postwar hilarity . Tom Drake and Grandpa from " Meet Me in St. Louis " two years later ( the year I was born ) . Donna Reed charming and pretty . Margaret Hamilton good as always ; smaller part than in " Wizard of Oz " . Spring Byington way prettier , also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton . Tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious . As a two year veteran of Army tents , he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes.<br /><br />I used to work in a department store , and it was just as elegant as this one . Sadly , it has disappeared and faded into obscurity . We were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store , to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise.<br /><br />10/10
1 On the surface , this is an above - average post - war romantic comedy . Beneath the veneer , it is MGM character actor stunt - casting at its funniest.<br /><br />The leads are straightforward , but all the secondaries are cast much against type . Margaret Hamilton ( aka Wicked Witch of the West ) , Edward Everett Horton ( professional obsessive - compulsive fussbudget ) , and Sig Ruman ( the Marx Brothers ' nemesis in _ Night In Casablanca _ and the always - wonderful _ Night At The Opera _ ) , playing a well - intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together , instead of driving them apart as their " usual " characters would do.<br /><br />It also pokes fun at many romantic - comedy conventions , which is another indication that this could be not so much a " straight " romantic comedy , as it is a wry send - up of the many post - war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional , stock characters.<br /><br />I've seen it only once , with interruptions , so I ca n't be positive , but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made , but is less successful now that viewers " see " these secondary characters through a completely different lens . I 'm assuming this is the case when I give it 9 stars . I thought it was hysterical .
1 Charleton Heston wore one , James Franciscus wore one but Mark Wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth . I hope no one casts him as Tarzan . Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies but Estrella Warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way . Tim Burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at . Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain . She 's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end . As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints . Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy . This movie has three great actors Tim Roth , Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch . Superlative make up ( a certain Oscar ) costumes , sets , music make this the hit summer movie of 2001 .
1 Take this movie for what it is , not a remake , but a completely different approach to the same concept . It 's not an epic like the original , it 's more of a popcorn thriller . Visually , it 's incredible . Everything else was just OK . < br /><br />For what it is , I think the movie is awesome , but I like everything Burton has done . People need to calm down and stop acting like it 's the end of the world b / c of this movie . It was n't supposed to be a remake , and it 's not . < br /><br />The ending was cool . . I took it as a parallel universe .
1 .... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me ! ! ! ! Whatever happened to the old Burton who read " The Dark Knight Returns " by Frank Miller as research for his preparation to direct Batman back in 1988 - 89 ? By the looks of it Burton did n't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything WRONG ! This movie sucks ! It 's not as good as the original and it does n't deal with the same subject as the original . If you want a good ape movie watch the original.<br /><br />**out of****stars
1 ATTENTION , SPOILER!<br /><br />Many people told me that « Planet of the Apes » was Tim Burton 's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film . So I decided not to see it . Another friend of mine who had n't seen the movie yet , advised me to watch it in spite of this because ` a Tim - Burton - movie is still a Tim - Burton - movie ' . I decided to do it , and I found that he was right.<br /><br />It 's clear that a remake of such a famous film as ` Planet of the Apes ' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking . Still , Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as ` Beetlejuice ' or ` Batman ' . If you are already fond of Burton - movies , it 's hard not to like one of his films , even if it has some flaws : nerve - racking monkey squeals , over - dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been , without difficulties , replaced by anbody else.<br /><br />What the film gives us in the first place , is an answer to the question : What 's the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake ? First of all , Burton would n't be Burton , if he would n't refuse to call it a remake from the start ; it 's a ` re - imagining ' . On the other hand , Burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring Charlton Heston ( as human ) , and he knows that a remake does n't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared . So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film , e. g. by referencing to quotes . Concerning the story - line , Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first , and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  AND HERE IS THE SPOILER  Leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever . < br /><br />Now , this is the burtonesque answer to people 's expectations they hold because of the astonishing , shocking ending of the first ` Planet of the Apes ' . An ending , even more unexpected , more astonishing and : completely confusing , because  and here I 'm disagreeing with various ` Planet of the Apes'-homepages and -platforms  it does not make any sense . There can not be a meaning to it , or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective . Tim Burton is playing his cruel games , he does it with a grin and he does it well . Burton fans will sure like it , others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism . Well , and I do n't think producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake again 
1 Kim Basinger stars as Della , a housewife who has twin children ( Terri and Tammi - played by Luke Gair and Erika - Shaye Gair ) and an abusive jerk for a husband ( Kenneth ) , played by Craig Sheffer.<br /><br />The movie opens on Christmas Eve . Kenneth is on his way home from work , driving a nice car too I might add . He is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner I would assume . When he gets home , he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about . This angers him even more and he takes up with his wife , Della , asking her why the house is always a mess . He pins her up against the wall . The twin 's watch from the stairs . He punches the wall , leaving a hole in it and walks away . She tends to the children , trying to comfort them . After that is all said in done , she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper . She gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there . While she is looking for a parking space , she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her . She finally finds a spot to park , makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a " selfish jerk " . Then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping.<br /><br />When she finally does leave the mall , it is closing and many people have left already . Not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle . She also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there . Odd . When she gets to her vehicle , she gets in to start it up . She notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up . She gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car ( Chuckie - played by Lukas Haas ) she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends . Yelling ensues and a mall cop ( no , not Paul Blart ) makes his way over to them to see what the problem is , only to have his brains blown out of his head by Chuckie . While this happens , Della jumps in her vehicle , starts it and drives over the median in front of her . Chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase . Della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed . She manages to make it to the back of her vehicle , open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there . < br /><br />With that , Della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons . The first kill , in my opinion , is the best . The first kill that Della performs anyway . The last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing . < br /><br />I will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and I was let down a bit myself . As a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it 's 1 hour and 20 minute run time .
1 In all my 60 years of age , I have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification ( whether we want it or not ) implicit with an specific character.<br /><br />Sometimes because the character executes certain gesture , sometimes because the character speaks determinate word , or sentence  that we use or that we would like to use  in determinate situation.<br /><br />The movie in question , should be seen by this point of view . Who now find a parking space  in a mall , downtown , or in the street - taken by a car whose driver ca n't remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world?<br /><br />Who has n't the urge to " rubber out " the ill mannered spat?<br /><br />Haven said that I ask : - Did you identify with DELLA ( played by Kim Bassinger ) ? If your answer is : YES ! , then try not to find absurd details  comparatively with life 's reality  in the movie , because you 'll certainly find the movie ridiculous.<br /><br />Abstractions made , you will see that the movie has moments of surprise , such as : 1- In the sequence in which Della grabs the box of tools in the trunk ( does that box contains a gun , and does she haves the guts to use it ? ) ; 2- In the sequence in which Terry dies whilst falling ; 3- In the sequence in which Della gets attracted by Chuckie 's " mermaid 's call".<br /><br />If you have already seen the movie , or if are planning seeing , keep in mind that there are " realistic " movies , " fiction " movies , " political " movies , and movies in which you can " wash your soul "   To exemplify the last one , we can quote : " Tropa de Elite".<br /><br />According to newspaper 's , there was unanimous applause when BOPE officials take certain attitudes . ( As I have seen the movie in DVD , I could not ascertain the audience 's reaction )  < br /><br />As for the direction part ( Susan Monford ) , interpretations ( Kim Bassinger , Lukas Haas , Craig Scheffer , etc . Edition ( William M. Anderson  ' Dead Poets Society ' , ' Green Card '  exceptional edition , ' Robocop 2 ' , etc . It is well situated in context . In a scale of 1(Awful ) to 10(Master Piece ) , I rate " When She Was Out " a 7(Regular ) .
1 While returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip , an abused suburban housewife ( Basinger ) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn.<br /><br />Suffering the indignity of a straight to DVD release here in the U.K. , Susan Montford 's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves . This is a shame , as the standard of the writing , directing and acting is very good indeed , and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to DVD flick.<br /><br />Kim Basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband ( Craig Sheffer ) . While Sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence , it is in their brief scenes together that Basinger connects - showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths . It 's a truly great , understated performance , her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played.<br /><br />Lukas Haas I initially thought was miscast , as he ( along with the other three youths ) just did not seem much of a threat . However , had all four youths been more physically imposing , the later scenes in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all . The fact that these are four average men , albeit slightly unhinged , is the key to why the film works as well as it does.<br /><br />Apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there , what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over . Some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes , or the abrupt ending . Others by the at times brutal violence . I say give it a chance , it 's certainly more deserving of your time than Saw V.
1 For Columbo fans , such as myself , this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why Columbo was so popular , and just how good it really was . Ruth Gordon has a field day ( as ever ) playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist Abigail Mitchell . Seems Abigail calls her nephew - in - law to sign some papers making him her heir . She never got over her niece 's death , and is convinced her dead niece 's husband ( Charles Frank ) did the dirty deed . To tell more would be unthinkable . Mariette Hartley has a sly role as Abigail 's personal assistant . This episode of Columbo is in a class by itself . It 's a truly well made television movie . I recommend it most highly .
1 Do n't waste time reading my review . Go out and see this astonishingly good episode , which may very well be the best Columbo ever written ! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son - in - law to avenge his murder of her daughter . Columbo is his usual rumpled , befuddled and far - cleverer - than - he - seems self , and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk . Ironically , this was not written by heralded creators Levinson or Link yet is possibly the densest , most thoroughly original and twist - laden Columbo plot ever . Utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking . Truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all . 10/10 ... seek this one out on Netflix !
1 A top notch Columbo from beginning to end . I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the killer , Ruth Gordon.<br /><br />As an avid Columbo fan , I ca n't recall another one in which he does n't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes . In this one , as he 's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the " message " that the nephew left behind , it finally dawns on him.<br /><br />The music in this episode is very good as well , as it is in many of other ones .
1 Ruth Gordon at her best . This episode is my favorite of the whole Columbo series . Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame , regardless of the rest of their work . Even the music was outstanding in this episode .
1 I have a lot of time for all the Columbo films , but this one in particular was extremely well written , and the solution at the end very effective . However , my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film , between Columbo and the murderer ( I apologise if I 've not remembered every detail of this exactly ) . It 's the most striking image of Columbo I 've seen : the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered , and into the room beyond , which is lit up by daylight . Columbo is sitting in a high - backed armchair facing the doorway ( and us ) , contemplating the cupboard , and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light . There 's no sound . The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him . He 's deep in meditation , puffing gently on a cigar , swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks . Then the dialogue starts . Superb .
1 Ruth Gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that Columbo has ever had to deal with . And , the plot is ingenious all the way around . This is one of the best Columbo episodes ever . Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles . And Peter Falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with Gordon .
1 I love this episode of Columbo . Maybe it 's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell , an American version of Dame Agatha Christie . She is delicious to watch as the perky , lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident . She blames her niece 's husband , the nephew . She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her . I would have loved somebody else than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica . I never really like Hartley in anything personally . And of course with Columbo , there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica at a belly - dancing class . Ruth 's Abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk .
1 Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945 , viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me . At age 15 , it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals . Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players . Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days , as a solo singer , this was his first major film appearance . As another viewer noted , this seems almost to be a warm - up for On the Town . Sinatra may have had to work hard at it , but his dance with Kelly is credible , and he would do better in their next pairings . However , observing his physique , it 's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean . Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting , and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat . Though Gene Kelly 's personality and dancing dominated this film , his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force , almost the iconic figure , for MGM musicals , where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire . Finally , it was strange to see the fresh - faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a " thrill " killer in Compulsion , based on the Leopold - Loeb murder from the 1920s . An additional note : One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra 's love interest . She later played opposite him in On the Town , but Pamela Britton was featured in this film .
1 Overall this is a delightful , light - hearted , romantic , musical comedy . I suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long . But I 'm not sure what you would cut out . The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do ? No . The fabulous dancing that Kelly does ? No . The time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters ? No ( that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies do n't develop the characters).<br /><br />Some comment that Iturbi did n't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s . So what if he was n't an actor ? He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him . < br /><br />Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star . Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria . During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling . You can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before.<br /><br />This movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights . Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie . You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did . A nice counter - point in the movie is how Sinatra ( a ladies man even then ) played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave . You 'll feel good after seeing this movie . 7/10
1 This one has a lot going for it - Sinatra , Styne , Cahn , Pamela Britten -and a lesser amount of dross - Iturbi , Grayson - plus a little ho hum - Kelly . It was Sinatra 's first real movie where the producer 's spent a buck and you could see it on screen ( previously he 'd appeared in two low - budgeters , Higher And Higher and Step Lively ) but if they 'd only relied on the Sinatra pipes and deep sixed Grayson 's plus Iturbi 's ego - tripping piano spots we 'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra . As it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We Hate To Leave , I Begged Her - to his own solos , What Makes The Sunset , The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love Too Easily . Despite this Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget .
1 Joseph Brady and Clarence Doolittle are two sailors , who have a four - day shore leave in Hollywood . Joe knows everything about girls and ca n't wait to see Lola , while Clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls . They then run into a little boy , Donald Martin , who has ran away in order to join the navy . They take him home and meet his beautiful aunt Susan , who wants to be a singer . Clarence wants Susie to be his girl , but his shyness gets in the way . But he does n't feel shy with a waitress , who comes from Brooklyn , like he does . Soon Joe notices he 's in love with Susie . The boys are in a fix when they lie to Susie on meeting with a big time music producer they do n't even know . As they are in a fix with their feelings . George Sidney 's Anchors Aweigh ( 1945 ) is a great musical comedy . Gene Kelly is top - notch , once again , in his singing and dancing routines . Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn . Shy is n't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Frank Sinatra , but he plays his part well . Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott . We sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88.The 9-year old Dean Stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor . Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself . It 's magic what he does with the piano . Edgar Kennedy plays Chief of police station . Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse . There 's a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers . Just look at Kelly and Sinatra performing " We Hate to Leave".It 's so energetic."If You Knew Susie ( Like I Know Susie ) " is quite funny . It 's a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms ' Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell . It 's lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango " Jealousy " .The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world , and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse . Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler . They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused . The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score . Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment .
1 The United States was still fighting World War II ( the movie was released in between VE day and VJ day ) . Any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy , or Americans in general were singing and dancing . Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed . Most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number ! I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970 . Depressing how quickly we forget.<br /><br />This film could 've been called " The Search for Jose Iturbi " but now everyone wonders why . Allow me to explain . From 1929 - -his arrival in America -- until his death in 1980 , Iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage . He agreed to do a few movies in 1942 , but Hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time . Not only an excellent pianist , but a successful conductor as well , Iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years . < br /><br />The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt 's Rhapsodies was planned early on -- and has n't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children ? Joe Pasternak , who produced that movie & many other MGM musicals , credited Iturbi with interesting America 's youth in classical music . Grayson 's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time . Everyone wanted Iturbi back then . The joke among soldiers was that " GI " meant " Get Iturbi " ( he did a lot of concerts at military bases).<br /><br />Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer , but at the time this movie was made Sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to Columbia Records for four years . Kelly was already well - known as a dancer , but Iturbi had by then been a world - wide sensation for 20 + years.<br /><br />And as to the lack of a plot , Americans did n't need plot . They were tired of war , they were sick with fear for their loved ones , and worried about the future . They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end . They needed music and smiles and joy and romance . This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed.<br /><br />Enough lecturing . Mouse dancing aside , the best scene in the movie occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them " ignorantly " complimenting the other 's music.<br /><br />If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi , the Spaniard who conquered more of America than De Soto , Cortez , and De Leon put together , please drop by my website , www.joseiturbi.com , where you can find a plot summary , excerpts from movie reviews " of the day " and pictures from this and certain other MGM musicals of the 1940 's , as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi.<br /><br />Trout
1 This film ( like Astaire 's ROYAL WEDDING - which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night ) is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kelly 's record : Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room 's walls and ceiling , this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse . The sequence is nicely done . What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day , and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background . Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white " Pomeranian " navy uniform with blue stripes on it . Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene . He actually talks - a first that he did not repeat for many decades . He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place - Tom briefly appears as King Jerry 's butler , trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses.<br /><br />But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie . Far more of this peculiar film is taken up with Kelly 's story of the lost four day furlough in Hollywood , and how Kelly ends up meeting Katherine Grayson and ( with Frank Sinatra ) stalking Jose Iturbi at the MGM film studio , the Hollywood Bowl , and Iturbi 's own home . Except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing.<br /><br />Kelly has saved Sinatra 's life in the Pacific , and is getting a medal as a result . They are both among the crewmen back in California who are getting a four day leave . But the script writers ( to propel what would be a short film - Kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one " Lola " , an unseen good time girl in Hollywood ) saddle Gene with Frank . < br /><br />It seems Frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories ( particularly musical comedies ) who are socially underdeveloped and in need of " instruction " about meeting girls ( or guys if the characters are women ) . Frank insists that Gene help " teach him " how to get a girl . Just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy ( Stockwell ) who insists on joining the navy ( and wo n't give the cops his real name and address ) . When a protesting Kelly is able to get this information out of Stockwell by asking him some straight questions ( which the cops could not ask ) , they insist Kelly take the boy home to his aunt ( Grayson ) . Still protesting , Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems ( mostly due to Sinatra 's simplistic soul view of things ) . He misses seeing Lola the next day by sleeping late - Sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up . He keeps getting dragged back to Grayson 's house , as Sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself , but needs Kelly to train him in love making.<br /><br />I suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of ANCHORS AWEIGH , but I find this kind of story irritating . While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly , Sinatra , Grayson , and Iturbi are first rate , it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like Sinatra 's character seriously . In the real world Kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough - what right has he to insist ( as Sinatra does ) that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date ? That kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me - unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense.<br /><br />The stalking of Iturbi is likewise annoying . Kelly tries to get Grayson to like Sinatra when he says Sinatra can get her a meeting with Jose Iturbi to audition her singing ability . For much of the rest of the picture Sinatra and Kelly try to do that , and keep floundering ( at one point - for no really good reason - Grayson herself ruins Kelly 's attempt to get an interview at MGM with Iturbi ) . It is only sheer luck ( that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson ) that she does give him an audition of her talent . < br /><br />Kelly , by the way , ends up with Grayson . Sinatra 's conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her ( but not pulling Kelly into it , oddly enough ) and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress ( Pamela Britton ) from his native Brooklyn . And naturally , without any assistance from Kelly , Sinatra and Britton fall in love . Ah,"consistency " ! Thy name is not " screenwriting " necessarily !
1 Although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars Frank Sinatra , Gene Kelly , Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney , a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line - up is nothing to sneeze at , and in conjunction , the line - up makes Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws.<br /><br />Sinatra and Kelly are Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady , respectively , two Navy men . As the film begins , they 're just pulling in to the Los Angeles area for some much needed leave . Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola . Doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears , appropriately enough , and seeks advice on women from Brady in private ( publicly , scriptwriter Isobel Lennart and Sidney have all of the Navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other ) . Brady promises to help get Doolittle hooked up , but primarily because Doolittle wo n't leave him alone otherwise . A kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the Navy . He wo n't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives . Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home . When the boy 's guardian , Susan Abbott ( Grayson ) , finally shows up , Doolittle goes gaga for her . Brady tries to convince him to forget about her ; Brady just wants to get back to Lola . But they keep getting coaxed back to Abbott 's home , and eventually something of a love triangle forms . Things become more complicated when Brady lies about Doolittle knowing a famous musician , Jose Iturbi , who is in residence at a film studio , and claims that Doolittle has set up an audition for Abbott , who is a singer and actress , in front of Iturbi.<br /><br />Because of the story , the music is a strange combination of militaristic music -- because of the Navy premise , obviously , Broadway pop -- what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings , opera -- what Abbott 's character excels at , Liberace - like popular classical -- what Iturbi did , and Mexican music -- because Abbott frequents a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican section of L.A. The combination does n't work as well as it could . Plenty of the songs are good , and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician , but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence . Worse , there are a couple showcases for Iturbi , who was apparently a big star at the time , that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time . I just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music , Robert Altman 's Kansas City ( 1996 ) , but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film . Anchors Aweigh takes a similar tactic . Yes , this is a musical , but there 's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material.<br /><br />There are also some plot problems . It 's not very well established why Brady is so against Doolittle 's pursuit of Abbott . We can guess that Brady thinks Doolittle should n't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid , and who seems relatively " proper " and traditional , but on the other hand , Brady can tell that Doolittle does n't have the same womanizing disposition that Brady admits of himself . Abbott seems like a good fit for Doolittle , and furthermore , Lennart works hard to establish that Brady just wants to get Doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting Lola -- it seems that Brady 's character should be quickly pawning Doolittle off on any candidate , whether she 's a good fit or not . This might seem like a minor detail , but it 's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot . The story also seems a bit drawn out . Length is a problem . Anchors Aweigh , clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes , should have been cut down by at least a half - hour.<br /><br />The above surely sounds like I 'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8 . I just wanted to stress what I see as flaws , because the conventional wisdom on Anchors Aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws.<br /><br />Sinatra , Kelly and Grayson are certainly charismatic , separately and together . They turn in good , interesting performances . Sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29  30 while shooting . He plays an unusually naïve , virginal character -- completely different than most of the roles he would take later , and different than his public image as a crooner . For Kelly , this was his breakthrough film , and rightfully so . His choreography is varied and impressive , as is his acting . Grayson is charming , her performance is sophisticatedly understated , and she 's simply gorgeous . All of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing.<br /><br />And there 's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because Sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods -- the infamous Kelly dance with Jerry the Mouse ( of " Tom and Jerry " fame ) in an extended fantasy sequence . This is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation , and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you 're a fan of fantasy . The fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film . Matched in excellence to the dance with Jerry the Mouse is a long song and dance number featuring Kelly and Grayson , where Brady is imagining Abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her , having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony.<br /><br />As uneven and flawed as the film is , it is largely successful and entertaining to watch . Fans of classic musicals certainly should n't miss Anchors Aweigh , and neither should Sinatra fans , who 'll get quite a kick out of his character .
1 Right from the start you see that " Anchors Aweigh " is a great comedy . Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team ! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment . Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet . Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I 've never seen . If you are fond of piano , you 'll be amazed by José Iturbi . This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number . Undoubtedly one of Kelly 's funniest movies .
1 Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra , Kathryn Grayson , and Jose Iturbi star in " Anchors Aweigh , " directed by George Sidney.<br /><br />Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence , two navy guys on leave in Hollywood . They meet a little boy ( Dean Stockwell ) and on taking him home , they meet his aunt ( Grayson ) . Clarence falls for her . She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi . They try to help , but there 's a mix - up.<br /><br />This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra . Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence . Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings . Not one of my favorite voices , but she does well . Iturbi 's piano work is beautiful.<br /><br />Sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him , with those big blue eyes and boyish face . For Kelly , this was a major break for him at MGM.<br /><br />Wonderful movie , very buoyant .
1 Similar to " On the Town , " this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs , but it has its own charms . Kelly has three fabulous dance routines : one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of " Tom and Jerry " fame , one with a little girl , and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony . Sinatra , playing Kelly 's shy , inexperienced buddy , and Grayson , the woman who serves as the love interest for both men , do most of the singing . Iturbi provides some fine piano playing . At nearly two and half hours , it is a bit too long for a light musical but it does n't drag .
1 Usually musicals in the 1940 's were of a set formula - and if you studied films you know what I 'm talking about - a certain running lenghth , very " showy " performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc.<br /><br />THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT - and light years better and well worth it 's nomination for best picture of the year - 1945 ( although had no chance of beating the eventual winner - Lost Weekend).<br /><br />Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career - yes I know about " American in Paris " and " Singing in the Rain " . This one is different . He really gets into his character of a " sea wolf " thinking ( at first ) that " picking up any girl while on leave " is nothing more than a lark . And if you had to make up a " story " to get her - so be it - until . Sort of like the Music Man when he gets " his foot caught in the door " . The eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal ( Sinatra ) 's attempt to make the " story " good in order to " get the girl " that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love with . You are going to have to see the movie to see what I mean.<br /><br />Besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one , it 's a classic buddy story , nostalgia to a time when WWII was almost over ( the war ended about a month after the films release ) , a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being , great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that I ca n't think of right now.<br /><br />Why not a 10 ? Near the end - at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long . There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now . But overall , this ones a definite winner on every level .
1 Two sailors are on leave -- ladies man Joseph Brady ( Gene Kelly ) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle ( Frank Sinatra ) . They meet beautiful Susan Abbott ( Kathryn Grayson ) and both fall in love with her . There 's more but you 've probably guessed it.<br /><br />The story ( even for a 1940s musical ) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome -- gets annoying pretty quick . Also this movie is far too long . It 's 140 minutes and that 's way too much for such a silly story . There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra . Still this is worth catching.<br /><br />When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical . None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you wo n't care . It 's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had . The acting is OK -- Kelly is fine ( although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it ) and Sinatra is just great ( although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too ! ) . Grayson is given nothing to do but she 's incredibly beautiful to look at . Some shots of her literally took my breath away ! There are plenty of highlights here : Sinatra and Kelly 's big dancing and singing number ; Sinatra singing anything ; Grayson 's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry -- an animated mouse ! Tom does a funny cameo too . Also there 's little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he 's in.<br /><br />So it 's too long and the plot just does n't hold up but it 's still worth catching . This was a huge hit in its day .
1 Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly , as well as Kathryn Grayson.<br /><br />The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll 's score , and it garnered nominations for Best Picture , Best Actor for Kelly , and Best Cinematography , as well as a Best Son nomination for " I Fall in Love Too Easily " sung by Sinatra.<br /><br />It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself . The lovely Grayson ( The Toast of New Orleans ) dazzled us with her singing , and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra , as well as the artistry of pianist - conductor José Iturbi.<br /><br />A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by .
1 " Anchors Aweigh " is the product of the classic MGM musical production unit , and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by Jule Styne and others , excellent dancing by Gene Kelly ( and even a passable job by Frank Sinatra ) , and a funny well - paced script . The only major element I would criticize would be the casting of Kathryn Grayson , whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo - operatic warbling from the petite Miss.<br /><br />Kelly plays a naval serviceman named Joseph Brady , a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose Valentino - charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle - American name of Clarence ( Sinatra ) . Upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving Clarence 's life , Joe reluctantly agrees to help Clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life . They are drafted by a policeman ( Rags Ragland ) , who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy ( Dean Stockwell ) who wants to join the Navy into returning home to " Aunt Susan " ( Grayson ) . At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing " Aunt Susan " but eventually Kelly 's character emerges as the more likely candidate.<br /><br />There are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to Kelly 's more famous work in films like " Singin ' in the Rain " and " American in Paris " . The closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with Kelly 's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with Jerry , the mouse from " Tom and Jerry " ( although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse ) . It 's a startling sequence for its time but does n't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time . I actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation , where Kelly was using semi - balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of " Alice in Wonderland".<br /><br />Eventually the characters find their way to Susan 's favorite bar , a somewhat sanitized Mexican restaurant / bar in Tijuana . There the patrons happily allow Ms. Grayson to chirp her arias with abandon , and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that Clarence and Joe have extended for her to sing with their " friend " Jose Iturbi ( playing himself with a light humorous touch ) . Of course they 've never met their " friend " Iturbi and they spend much of the film 's length trying to reach him ( in an amusing scene Sinatra 's character meets Iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career ) , sneaking into the studio and the Hollywood Bowl , where Iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you have n't seen anything like this outside of " 1000 Fingers of Dr. T " . Iturbi himself is a kind of a god - figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine . Everyone is 100 % sure that as soon as Mr. Iturbi so much as hears Ms. Grayson , her operatic career will be a reality . The 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film 's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down - to - earth " real " mannerisms of the maestro . And speaking of Iturbi 's contributions to the film , he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of " Donkey Serenade".<br /><br />When all is said and done , this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss . The majority of the music was written for this film , a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other Kelly opuses like " Rain " and " American " . Kelly is still at his early peak , adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character . Sinatra 's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing . Stockwell is a charming addition to the clan , and Grayson 's character is endearing when she is n't posturing on stage . Iturbi adds that well - grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic - era MGM musical . This is one of the better ones .
1 ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I would n't rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON . This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together . Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle , two sailors on leave in Hollywood who befriend a young boy ( Dean Stockwell)who introduces them to his attractive young aunt ( Kathryn Grayson ) a struggling actress who is working as an extra at MGM . Though both guys are initially attracted to Grayson , she eventually voices a preference to Joe but Clarence later hooks up with a waitress ( Pamela Britton)who , he learns is from his hometown of Brooklyn . The paper - thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including " We Hate to Leave " , Joe and Clarence 's lament to their fellow sailors as they 're leaving the ship ; Grayson 's torrid rendition of " Jalousie " ; Sinatra 's dreamy rendition of " I Fall in Love Too Easily " ( a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film ) , and " The Worry Song " , a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame . Kelly also does a sort of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his Pirate 's Ballet in the later THE PIRATE . Kelly is in peak form here , in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra 's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy . An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory .
1 Incredibly ARTISTIC NOBODY COULD MAKE THEM NOW I THINK.It seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry . I'M Italian AND ADMIRED BY American MUSICAL . why ca n't you do something like that now?American were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie.there are words to describes the perfection of this movie . all of a sudden my heart sings , what makes the sunset ? i fall in love to easily , jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry . the greatest without reserve . if you you does n't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate ... wake up !
1 A recent viewing of THAT 'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties . ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN . The songs are n't as good , nor is the chemistry between the characters . But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites , such as Tchaikovsky . And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl , with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top , and then running down the steps , while dozens of pianists play on the piano , is the best scene in the film , even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous . Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing . Sinatra then croons , " I Fall in Love Too Easily , " before having his epiphany about whom he loves . The color is beautiful , Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution - free air ( Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties , let alone the mid-1940s ? ! ) , and the piano music is absolutely glorious . MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these .
1 One of the first of the best musicals , Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences , such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse , Kelly dancing with 7-year - old Sharon McManus , Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano , Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting , and much more . The Technicolor is perfect , with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath , through transparent keys , and Grayson singing , seen through the finder of another camera . The plot is thin , but you get involved from Kelly 's & Sinatra 's enthusiasm . Sailor 's on leave , they have to take home a runaway boy ( Dean Stockwell ) and Sinatra falls for his aunt . To set him up with the aunt ( Grayson ) , Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi . But Sinatra 's young and naive in this one , and in his own sung words falls in love too fast . While they 're trying to contact Iturbi , who 's never available , he starts to fall for another girl ( Barbara Britton ) ; but Kelly 's now falling love with Grayson . Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live - action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry , but there 's a lot more here that 's worth a look . I 'm giving it nine stars because , while it 's not quite as good as the best musicals - Singin ' In The Rain , The Music Man , Oklahoma - it is one of the first of their class of Technicolor big productions ( perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was the first ) , and better than most others .
1 I really liked this movie . I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best . I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris . Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers , but not in this movie . It is definitely worth renting .
1 Ah , a Kelly / Sinatra sailor - suit musical . So familiar , right ? Yes , but this is n't the one you usually hear about . On The Town 's that - a - way . But if you stick around , you might learn something . Okay , probably not . Anyway , Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three- or four - day leave . Joe is the " Sea Wolf " and Clarence , the bookish type , begs Joe to get him a " dame " . Now , after they 're picked up by the coppers they get little Donald home . That 's where they meet Susie , that temptress , that jezebel . Just kidding ! Clarence falls in love with her . At least he thinks he does . Is he right ? Or is he a moron ? Or is he just misguided by society ? Find out all this and more when you watch { trumpet fanfare } ANCHORS AWEIGH!<br /><br />P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but sickeningly sweet , try Kiss Me Kate ( 1953 ) .
1 For such films like ` Anchors Aweigh ' , few have been bestowed with as many Academy Award accolades in a warm up for happy hour . Either 1945 was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by Billy Wilder 's ` The Lost Weekend ' that they wrote anything starting with A on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public . Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in ` Singin ' in the Rain ' , then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at MGM . Of course , the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of Hollywood itself , handy for those stuck on the other side of the world.<br /><br />Yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce , despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today 's audiences would n't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime . There have been many longer pieces before and since , but in this case all of the charming Kathryn Grayson 's scenes could have been eliminated . Until the viewing of ` Kiss Me Kate ' it may have been necessary non - opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand . < br /><br />If there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949 's ` On the Town ' , then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted ` Susie ' rendition . Few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of MGM . Then few are even luckier to be attended to . There are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson , but it makes the continual non - opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both . < br /><br />But for all , the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight , but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale , makes ` Anchors ' at least does n't question picking the wrong MGM film . The direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography . Whenever anyone bursts into music or song , the film makes for a joyous occasion.<br /><br />The natural highlight of the film is Gene Kelly 's cartoon adventures in a fantasyland , climaxing in a brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse . This is a well - deserved masterpiece number of Kelly 's career , and it 's nice to know he thought of it before Fred Astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings.<br /><br />It 's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour , rainbow sprinkled , chocolate wafer , cream and cherry and banana split sundae , but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt , is still a pleasant feeling.<br /><br />Rating : 7/10
1 This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot . It is another sailors on leave film , zippier than Astaire 's ' Follow the Fleet ' but not as good as ' On The Town ' . < br /><br />Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra work well together . Their ' If you Knew Susie ' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it . ' I Begged Her ' is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing . Sinatra 's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story . Fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like Grady Sutton , Rags Ragland , Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi as himself , to keep one watching.<br /><br />Kelly is the star of the film , although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children , which Astaire never did . Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the Kelly character . He also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the Pomeranian ( ! ) navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse . In another scene he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl , Sharon McManus , that is entrancing and sweet . < br /><br />Very pleasant then but a bit too long . A taster of better musicals to come .
1 Yes , this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly , not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson . The music and dancing is superb . I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly ; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse , which is quite unique for the time . Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra . She is one of Hollywood 's great underrated stars . I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes . Never get tired of these old musicals . Whatever happened to Hollywood ? ?
1 Lots of singing and dancing in this one , especially by Gene Kelly . Two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance . They meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business . Musical lovers only .
1 Though I liked On the Town better I really liked it . I 'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly . Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently . The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene 's . I think that is better too . But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it 's an awesome movie and I love it . Frank and Gene make a good team . I have yet to see them together in Take me out to the Ballgame . But I 'm sticking to my guns bu saying that I really enjoyed it , and that I love it !
1 Virgil Manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse . Chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property , Manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods . He reports the crime to the police but there 's no body to be found . Troubled by disturbing visions , he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn  " Soft for Digging " is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare . This minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue . Some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent . The location sets provide plenty of creepiness : the eerie Maryland woods rival those used in " The Blair Witch Projcect".Give this strange horror film a chance.9 out of 10 .
1 I really think I should make my case and have every(horror and or cult)movie - buff go and see this movie ... <br /><br />I did!<br /><br />It - is - excellent : Very atmospheric and unsettling and scary ... <br /><br />Incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low(read-"no"!)-budget they had .... <br /><br />Synopsis taken from website : " One morning , an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat . He finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse ... " < br /><br />On this website(IMDb ) there is no trailer , but I will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there IS a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out ... <br /><br />www.softfordigging.com
1 Do n't be swayed by the naysayers . This is a wonderfully spooky film . This was a thesis project for the writer / director , JT Petty . He did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat . I never really knew what to expect , and for a jaded horror - movie goer , this is Nirvana ! The film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods . One day , while searching for his cat in the woods , he witnesses the murder of a child , or does he ? He agonizes about this the rest of the film . What is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes . I found this to be intriguing . The writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug . Give this film a go , you wo n't be disappointed .
1 The premise of the story is simple : An old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child , and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred . Though very little dialog is provided throughout the film , the visual narrative told by the camera 's eye alone made the film quite engaging . The setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness , which complements the quietness of the characters themselves . We can also sense helplessness in the old man 's inability to convince the police of the murder , which parallels the silenced child 's inability to tell her own story.<br /><br />True horror lies in feelings of hopelessness , helplessness , and irrationality . This film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone , rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak.<br /><br />Cleverly , the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments . The ending is also unexpected and believable . Reminiscent of Japanese horror films , such as " The Ring , " and " Dark Water , " or English horror films , such as " Lady in Black , " and " The Innocents , " this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror . I recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try.<br /><br />By the way , if you have n't seen the films I just mentioned above , you might want to give them a try as well .
1 An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat . He wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind ? Is he just getting old ? The movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on . There is very little dialog in this movie but it does n't need words , the whole movie speaks for itself . You knew what was going on and I liked it.<br /><br />The other part that I liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter . Those were pretty but the only thing I did n't like was the view of the old man in his underwear . He could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that , it was a pretty deep movie .
1 This is an excellent film and one should not be put off by its strangeness . There is genuine skill in manufacture of this work . It manages to be intrigiung , funny and frightening at various times . Work with it for the first few minutes and you wo n't be disappointed
1 Saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it . I 'm a student of screen writing and I loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal / climatic happened in a scene . < br /><br />I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking - at one particular point Barbara Stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter 's boyfriend ; AND rekindling some passion in her husband whom she has n't seen in ten years ; AND with the gunshot signal ' two shots and then one ' she hooks up with her old shag mate Dutch ( the reason she left town in the first place ! ) ALL AT THE SAME TIME ! The moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50's.<br /><br />Love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co doing the ' Bunny Hug ' is good enough reason to rent this film on DVD.<br /><br />One of the best films from that period I 've seen in a long time .
1 Barbara Stanwyck gives this early Douglas Sirk - directed , Universal - produced soap just the kick that it needs . Not nearly as memorable as Sirk 's later melodramas , it 's easy to see by watching " All I Desire " where Sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years . Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown , U.S.A , after deserting them a decade earlier . Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return . Some of the cinematography is amazing , and Stanwyck is tough - as - nails and really gives this film a shot of energy . Overall , a fairly good show .
1 Yes , I call this a perfect movie . Not one boring second , a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors , a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with , perfect lighting , crisp black and white photography , a fitting soundtrack , an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works . It 's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest , the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning . There was nothing this actress could n't do , and she always went easy on the melodramatic side . No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford , and this movie confirmed my opinion . Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments . It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career , and this one is by far the least interesting.<br /><br />The title fits this movie very well . It is about desires , human desires I think everyone can understand . Actually , no one seems to be scheming in this movie , all characters act on impulse , everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else . The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here.<br /><br />I liked what this movie has to say about youth , about maturing and about the necessity to compromise . The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt , it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America . The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang 's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night , made one year earlier , where Stanywck stars in a similar part . I can also recommend it .
1 This early Sirk melodrama , shot in black and white , is a minor film , yet showcases the flair of the German director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art . Set in the 1910 's , Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small - town husband and family for the lure of the Chicago stage . She never fulfilled her ambitions , and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre ( a high school production , that is ) . Back in her old town she once again comes up against small - mindedness , and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter , bewildered ( and boring ) husband ( Richard Carlson ) and ex - lover . The plot is nothing new but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions , with every frame carefully shot , and he is aided immeasurably by having Stanwyck as his leading lady . It runs a crisp 76 minutes , and that 's just as well , because the material does n't really have the legs to go any further .
1 Most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two Demons films . And with the " Demons III " in the title , one would assume it would . The problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the Demons series . The distributors only a " Demons III " above its original title " The Ogre " to cash in on the other films popularity . The new American DVD release of this picture has the title " Demons III : The Ogre " on the box art but the film itself only says " The Ogre " . I do n't know if past releases had the title " Demons III " on the actual film itself , but this new release just seems to be a little white lie . If you can get past the " Demons III " in the title , you might some enjoyment in " The Ogre " . It starts out with a creep intro , and stays pretty creep throughout . There 's no gore and the film movies slowly , but I still dug it . Just do n't expect it to be like the other Demons films . I give " The Ogre " 7 out of 10 . Italian fans should try it out .
1 To anyone who has n't seen this film yet , I have a friendly warning : do n't watch " La Casa dell'Orco " expecting any demons at all , because you wo n't find them here . This film is not a third installment to the " Demons " series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever , except the fact that Lamberto Bava directed them . As a matter of fact , Michele Soavi 's " The Church " is also known an unofficial " Demons 3 " and it 's a deceptive title in that case as well , so go figure . It is obvious that due to the " Demons " films success ; they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles , even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story . Having said that , I think it 's unfair on the other hand , to say that " La Casa dell'Orco " is not worth the look . Honestly , the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations , I thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole . Nevertheless , I think it 's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate Lucio Fulci 's " The House by the Cemetery " . Of course , that 's just a speculation I have , but I think I have my valid evidences . For instance , in both films , Paolo Marco is the man of the family , in both films , there 's an irritating little son named Bobby , in both films , the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty - something , who seems to be the only one to see that there 's something really wrong in the new house , and in both films , there 's something really , really wrong going on in the basement . I 'm sorry but I can relate both films very easily and I 'm not saying that as an accusation . For the contrary , my point is that those who enjoyed " The House by the Cemetery " are probably going to enjoy this movie as well , keeping in mind of course , that " La Casa dell'Orco " is far less pretentious , less scary , not nearly as atmospheric , but the formula is still there.<br /><br />In " La Casa dell'Orco " , Charel , her husband Tom and their little son , Bobby , go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle , situated in the heart of an Italian villa called Trifiri . Leaving aside the beauty of the place , shortly after their arrival , Charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before , which is impossible , considering that she had never been to Trifiri before . Sadly , Charel ca n't get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions , come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her . Tom , who is not a very patient guy to begin with , advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation . However , the woman 's visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy , suddenly turn into a living nightmare . The old nightmare from Charel 's childhood becomes real and this time , she wo n't be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first.<br /><br />As it is expected , the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence , it is hard to fill an hour and a half . This means that " La Casa dell'Orco " offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character , walking around the castle for several minutes , reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else . It gets rather tedious from time to time , but overall , it 's nothing serious . Like many Italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties , this movie is pretty stylish and effective , but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments , that make the movie unforgettable in a way . For instance , the part in which Charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like I would have expected , she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac . The funniest thing however , is the fact that two minutes later , they 're a happy couple again , as if punching each other like that , was the most natural thing in the world . I know it 's silly , but I myself , found it absolutely hilarious . The ogre ( which is obviously the villain of the story ) looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let 's face it : a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit , it 's twice as welcomed . It reminded me of Michael Jackson in " Thriller " , but much more natural and human , of course . But if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that I mentioned before : the music composed by Simon Boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same , it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension . So if I have to give my final statement regarding this movie , I 'm going to have to say that I ca n't help loving it , including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical Italian horror movies from the late eighties , wo n't be disappointed by this one . It has all the typical and always well received clichés , like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth , the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch , a creepy castle , a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility , to stay away from the infamous lands . I would say that " La Casa dell'Orco " deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse 's face , as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story . Take this movie for what it is and enjoy it .
1 The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and was n't intended to be a sequel to Demons as Lamberto Bava even mentions it on the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD , but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series . The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80 's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror Demons III : The Ogre is a architectural horror so that 's how Demons III is n't a proper sequel to Demons but I still like this film.<br /><br />The music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in , The Ogre is another thing why I like the film . There are two other films that are classed as Demons III and that is Black Demons ( Demoni 3 ) and The Church ( Demons 3 ) . Demons III : The Ogre is a good film as long as you do n't compare it with Demons and Demons 2 .
1 Alright , before we review , I have to ask : why is n't this listed individually ? It may have been merely a TV item in Italy , but to international Lamberto Bava fans this is its own FILM . In America this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as either " The Ogre " or " Demons 3 " . Yes , I know it has nothing to do with " Demons " apart from one cast member and the crew . But yes , I personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so useful.<br /><br />Finally , let 's review " The Ogre " . I 've seen the trailer for this many times on YouTube and honestly found that rather scary . The movie itself ( it is feature length , therefore making it a movie ) has many many strong parts and does manage to scare . I was displeased by the last act , but on the whole I do n't regret having bought the DVD before seeing it ( available from Shriek Show ) . I guess the film 's TV origins explain the last act . I wo n't give out any spoilers.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat familiar : an American horror writer vacationing at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares . There are faint echoes of " The Shining " , but this is a different brand of supernatural horror . The woman ( Virginia Bryant ) finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares , but her husband wo n't believe her . Great atmosphere and terror follow.<br /><br />The multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky . The Ogre cocoon effect was good , it reminded me a bit of Uncle Frank 's resurrection from the first " Hellraiser " . There 's also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene . I give them props that the film never stooped to imitating American films with similar concepts , namely " A Nightmare on Elm Street " . " The Ogre " is an original . And the monster itself was a scary one , when it was presented correctly.<br /><br />On the Shriek Show DVD there is a Lamberto Bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic " Demons " series . He also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed . Indeed , this setting contributes a lot to the film . The Simon Boswell music helps too.<br /><br />There 's lots of good stuff here . " The Ogre " is not perfect , but it is very much worth seeing . Take it is a lesser Lamberto Bava achievement .
1 The Ogre does n't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 , and I guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle ' Demons 3 ' in order to help it sell better . Well , the film is directed by Lamberto Bava ; the man behind the first two Demons films , and ogres and demons are somewhat alike ( in that they 're both ' monsters ' anyway) ... but other than that , this film has no connections to the other two films . It is , however , rather good ! Italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films , and while it 's not completely obvious ; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from Hellraiser . The plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in Italy . She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement . It 's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return ... and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there 's a murderous ogre living in the basement.<br /><br />The film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for Italian TV , so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant ; but for what it is , this is certainly a very decent horror film . Lamberto Bava may not have as keen an eye as his father Mario did ; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well . The central setting , a large castle , makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and Lamberto makes the best of it ; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times ; such as the Inferno - style pool scene . The plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange ( particularly between the husband and wife ) . There 's not a great deal of bloodshed , but Bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects . The ogre itself looks really silly and it 's a good job that we do n't get to see it very often . We do boil down to a fitting , if highly predictable , ending and overall I have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended .
1 Best - selling horror novelist Cheryl ( a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant ) , her husband Tom ( the likable Paolo Serra ) , and their son Bobby ( nicely played by Patrizio Vinci ) go to a remote castle located in the countryside for summer vacation . Local legend claims that the area is cursed . Cheryl discovers a creepy , hairy , nasty ogre ( hulking David Flosi in a strikingly hideous costume ) living in the basement . Cheryl has to surmount her deep - seated childhood fear of the beast so she can defeat the foul find . Director / co - writer Lamberto Bava does an expert job of creating and sustaining an eerie and unnerving nightmarish mood . Moreover , Bava eschews the standard blood'n'guts fright flick routine in favor of crafting a compelling and provocative dark adult fairytale - like fable on how the best way to overcome that which frightens us is to face said source head on . Sturdy supporting turns by Sabrina Ferilli as friendly school teacher Anna , Stefania Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria , and Alex Serra as batty painter Dario . Gianfranco Transunto 's glossy cinematography boasts a few fluid tracking shots and plenty of great atmospheric lighting . Fabrizio Sforza 's gnarly make - up f / x , Simon Boswell 's splendidly spirited spooky'n'shuddery score , and the dank , dark , cobweb - covered cellar set all hit the skin - crawling spot . Well worth watching .
1 Director Edward Montagne does in a little more than one hour what other , more expensive and hyped films fail to do . Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. that while , is not one of the best of the genre , it keeps the viewer involved in all that 's going on.<br /><br />This is clearly a B type movie . In fact , the best thing going for " The Tattooed Stranger " is the opportunity to take a peek at the way New York looked in those years . The crystal clear cinematography by William O. Steiner , either has been kept that way through the years , or has been lovingly restored.<br /><br />There are great views of New York in the opening sequence . Later we are taken to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section and later on the film travels to the Bronx and the Gun Hill Road area with its many monument stores in the area.<br /><br />John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great detective team . Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert from the Museum of Natural History . Jack Lord , who went to bigger things in his career , is seen in a non speaking role.<br /><br />It was great fun to watch a city , as it was , because it does n't exist any more .
1 This police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few . Obviously it is following in the steps of " Dragnet " and " Naked City " but emerges as an enjoyable programmer . The best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gone ... the lower class New York of the late 40's / early 50 's . Here it is in all its seedy glory , from the old - school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons . These old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized , soulless cityscape of today.<br /><br />Also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts - and - bolts scientific aspect of solving the crime ... in this case , the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car . Our main heroes , Detectives Tobin and Corrigan , do the footwork , but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the " lab boys " , they 'd get nowhere . Although the technology is not in the same league , the cops here use the dogged persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to track down their man.<br /><br />The way some reviewers have written about this movie , you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and acted by extras from his movies . What bosh ! I enjoyed John Miles as the gangly ex - Marine turned cop Tobin ... he had a happy - go - lucky , easy - going approach to the role that 's a welcome change from the usual stone - faced histrionics of most movie cops of the period . Patricia Barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime . Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective Corrigan . I rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic " Dragnet " approach.<br /><br />The mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot - out certainly wo n't rank amongst the classics of crime cinema , but during it 's brief running time , " The Tattooed Stranger " more than held my interest .
1 The Tattooed Stranger was another of those rare B - movies that BBC2 screened over Christmas / New Year 2005 - 2006 . See also They Live By Night and The Brighton Strangler.<br /><br />In this one , a man walking his dog in Central Park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside . She was shot and police then try to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue . After being identified , the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the end.<br /><br />Most of this movie was shot on location in and around New York , so we get to see some areas of the city we do n't normally see , especially the back streets.<br /><br />Mostly unknowns are in the cast , with John Miles getting top billing.<br /><br />The Tattooed Stranger is worth seeking out . Excellent but rather obscure.<br /><br />Rating : 3 stars out of 5 .
1 This is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time . It has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse , a weary middle - aged cop Corrigan ( Walter Kinsella ) and his rookie sidekick Tobin ( John Miles ) , a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the Tobin in the shape of a female botanist Mary ( Patricia Wright ) who helps solve the crime . There 's also a terrific shoot - out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard.<br /><br />Watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt . Corrigan refers to the dead woman as ' Tatooed Tilly ' BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo ( confusing huh ? ) . Also later when Tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did n't catch him !
1 Its not sophisticated , and nobody in the credits had a great career , but taken as a whole , because there are no famous personalities ; the film seems more realistic than some high budget , well cast films.<br /><br />A film made for a few bucks , that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actors.<br /><br />The problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time . TV was taking over the revenues of the film industry , and this film could have easily been shown on TV . In 1950 , all the fare on TV would qualify for a " G " rating . The film industry began to make more " adult " films that could not be shown on TV during the days when TV would n't dare show the sex and skin of today 's commercials .
1 The story : On the island Texel , photographer Bob , who makes a photo shoot for a magazine , meets the mysterious Kathleen . Her free spirit and lust for life intrigues Bob , who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before . Her life is not so simple as it seems , however . Through Kathleen , Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network . Will Kathleen be able to win his trust?<br /><br />Review : The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character 's ' psychology ' would have been worked out a little more . Why do these people do the things they do ? What motivates their choices ? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view . The story never reaches an emotional climax , even though the characters go through enough to justify that . So you do n't get to know the characters on that deeper level . The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and ' believable ' way , but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress , as this character 's naiveness does n't quite work for a grown - up woman . Camera - work is nice , and there are some great shots of the nature on the island . I give the movie a 7/10 .
1 I happily admit that I 'm a sucker for a beautiful film , and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film . Not one the length of Gojoe though , even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography I 've seen since the Korean period piece MUSA . However , Gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images ( as does MUSA ... do n't which to imply a contrast ) - it 's second greatest strength is superb acting , and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy . I must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end , but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way . Vague ones , but definitely thoughts : p < br /><br />One department in which the film could have been better is the action . There 's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film , but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close - ups , and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground . It does create some very intense and impressive visuals , but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves , something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone.<br /><br />Still , the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films I 've seen for quite some time . Recommended !
1 This movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies . Many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably wo n't understand why I find it so enthralling so I will try to explain ... <br /><br />The movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights , and while it has a few minor anachronisms , they are completely forgivable . The story is a retelling of the famous duel between the Monk Benkei and the young Prince Yoshitsune on Gojo bridge . During the fight according to legend Yoshitsune bests Benkei and the monk becomes the prince 's loyal retainer . This movie is a revision of that story however and involves war , dark prophecy , and political maneuvering.<br /><br />One of the main themes in the movie is " Mappo " , which is the prophecy by the Buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos . It was believed in Heian Japan , after the eruption of Mt Fuji and the civil war between the Taira ( Heike ) and the Minamoto ( Genji ) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse . It is a time of demons.<br /><br />Next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of Yoshitsune 's sword training by the Tenku ( Raven Goblins ) of Karuma . Defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off . This is said to be where ninja clans began historically . Yoshitsune 's depiction in Gojo nicely accommodates all of this.<br /><br />Then there is Benkei , and the various strains of Buddhism depicted , including a lot of Esoteric Buddhism of the Shingon sect . These are all depicted quite accurately , and just to add a little extra , the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story , i.e. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.<br /><br />All - in - all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true - to - life for the period . The scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic . The soundtrack is great , very brooding and ominous . I also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good . Benkei is a great brooding anti - hero , Shanao ( Yoshitsune)is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power , and Tetsukichi the scavenging sword - smith makes for and interesting depiction of the " common man " and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.<br /><br />As to the plot , to see why it is so good , I really suggest you dig up an old book on Japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted Robin Hood vs Little John story into a gory tale of intrigue , violence and infernal karma .
1 One of the less widely lauded of recent Asian period action affairs Gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering , exciting , layered and beautiful . I 'm sad to say I know virtually nothing of the Buddhist philosophy or Japanese history and legend that surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me , but even without contextual knowledge this is still rich fare , taking a traditional fantasy structure into a , impactful higher plane . The story is of Benkei , a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of Gojoe Bridge : Prince Shanao , himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons . Thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in Benkei 's case , indecision , a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge , for Benkei to come to terms with his true nature and for Prince Shanao to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become . Benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world , even when not in open conflict he is never at ease . Director Sogo Ishii handles this one as an epic , with measured pace , camera work always stylish and often frenzied , without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in , there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere , there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy . The cinematography of Makoto Watanbe is important here , vivid and detailed , a richly evocative affair . Actingwise Daisuke Ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as Benkei , while Tadanobu Asano has a driven , cold arrogance as Prince Shanao . Of the leads Masatoshi Nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man , smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are . The film all fits together well , it is however a touch flabby at times , it begins slowly , some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary . As for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves , it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans , often obscured by objects , flashing blades and fast moving individuals , whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day , it is invigorating to watch but in the end I could have done with a little more traditionalism . There is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well , it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting . Overall though I found this to be a pretty great film , its not one for regular action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another Azumi , rather a deeper and more mystical beast , its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare . But as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously inclined it might do so too . Well recommended at any rate .
1 I personally thought the movie was pretty good , very good acting by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer fame . I really ca n't say much about the story , but there were parts that confused me a little too much , and overall I thought the movie was just too lengthy . Other than that however , the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot , great effects , and a lot of sword play . Another solid effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion . Well I really ca n't say anymore about the movie , but if you 're only outlook on Asian cinema is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers , I would suggest you trying to rent it , but if you 're a die - hard Asian cinema fan I would say this has to be in your collection very good Japanese film .
1 I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie . The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.<br /><br />I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world . The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text ( Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China , Korea and Japan ) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar ... people back then really thought that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has the action , story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer . I strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene ( I ca n't give anything away -- sorry ) .
1 Sogo Ishii has taken the old myth of Musashibo Benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark , gory , spellbinding and terrific - looking movie . Those unfamiliar with the legend wo n't need to be ; the story explains itself nicely as it goes along . Well worth seeking out even though there are no English - language home video versions .
1 I am glad I saw this film having seen some of the director 's other films in the past . I thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge . It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes . They were hard to follow at times.<br /><br />Ultimately , a moral tale . It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought of the film . It is a film I would like to see again.<br /><br />Some scenes like the ones where Benkai and the Prince were fighting on a " psychic " level were well done.<br /><br />I did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here . Intense .
1 Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre . Successful , and not , in varying degrees.<br /><br />Buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary ( and very active ) demon at the Gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment . While not at the forefront , Buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie , much like Kurosawa 's " Ran " . It probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it 's nowheres near " Ran 's " league . < br /><br />Stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length . The lead actors are uniformly excellent . The music is really good . The two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes . The movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing . And the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close - ups . This works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat . Another recent film like this is Tsui Hark 's " Seven Swords " , great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing . Asano really does n't move like a sword wielding demon , his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene.<br /><br />Good movie , you 'll probably find it interesting just do n't expect traditional sword fights .
1 As incredible as it may seem , Gojoe is an anime- and Hong Kong - inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message . This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist ( a great acting job done by Daisuke Ryu ) , a killer - turned - to - boddhist - monk Benkei . Benkei has sworn never to kill again , but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion ... <br /><br />Gojoe is a film difficult to rate . It 's visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful , but it uses too much trickery ( circling camera and high speed drives , expressionistic shots , leeched colors , digital effects etc . ) , so the end result is somewhat tiring . That said , the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful . If only the director Sogo Ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks.<br /><br />Other problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence . For a film with such an anti - violent message Gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes . Also , the way the violence is shown is always on the edge of being self - indulgent ; in fact , a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the films signature images . Luckily , Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly , tragic side of violence as well . Still , it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he 's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory . The audience ca n't be sure of this , either , until the very end of the film . The powerful ( albeit cynical ) ending is what saves Gojoe ; it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore - fest .
1 GOJOE takes a little getting used to at first , but the final result is very satisfying . The tale , about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate , but dangerous samurai , is worth more than a watch . There is a lot at stake here , from physical survival to soulful salvation . The movie may seem a bit similar to other anime - inspired Samurai film at first , but it does eventually delve into more mature / adult territory soon after.<br /><br />Not to be missed . GOJOE is one of the better samurai movies to come around post - Kurosawa.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films )
1 Well , if you are one of those Katana 's film - nuts ( just like me ) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical Katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick.<br /><br />Starring Tadanobu Asano ( Vital , Barren Illusion ) & Ryu Daisuke ( Kagemusha ) . This samurai war between Heiki 's clan versus Genji 's clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at Gojo bridge . The body - count is countless.<br /><br />Demons , magic swords , Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest.<br /><br />A good Japanese flick for a rainy summer night .
1 Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema , taking very creative directors , editors and photographers and working on historic themes , what the Japanese call " period pieces " . Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color , photography , and editing . Brilliant , even . The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism , demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture , but not really explored in Kurosawa 's samurai epics , or the Zaitochi series . Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji ( 2001 ) . I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors . Other recent Japanese period pieces I would highly recommend include Yomada 's Twilight Samurai ( 2002 ) and Shintaro Katsu 's Zatoichi : The Blind Swordsman ( 2003 ) .
1 At two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles . The battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between ' demons ' , bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse.<br /><br />Be prepared : following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement .
1 I saw this film and heard the writer - director , Juan Gerard , speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival.<br /><br />All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year - old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family.<br /><br />Its opening scene will bring to mind " Cinema Paradiso " . In fact , the film is filled with references to classic films : The Roulette Wheel ( Casablanca ) , " chicken clucking " ( Rebel Without a Cause ) , references to Bunuel , " Touch of Evil " ; you 'll find more . The homeless man ( Georg Stanford Brown)is a reference to Cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of Greek chorus.<br /><br />What this film really is is the culmination of a dream . Gerard 's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life.<br /><br />This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real , as are the events depicted . Gerard is actually an architect and engineer ( and passionate film lover ) but his dream was to make this movie . He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an " angel " who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it . Keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather " Che " . Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast . Iben Hjejle ( High Fidelity ) and Gael Garcia Bernal ( Y tu Mama Tambien ) offer strong support in key roles.<br /><br />Truthfully , the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines , and some overracting , but stay with it . The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet , and honest climax . It is the first effort of Juan Gerard , but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through , in this sincere first effort . I would definitely see it again , and hope that he continues his film career.<br /><br / >
1 Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife ( who produced it ) took a Q&A afterwards.<br /><br />I found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.<br /><br />Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso , it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba . However , do n't expect this to be a movie about the revolution , it 's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous . Many references to the directors obvious love of film history ( a great " Bicycle Thief " homage " ) and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.<br /><br />Enjoy !
1 This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution . It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love . < br /><br />The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film . DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense . It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people 's daily lives and pursuits . That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history.<br /><br />The excessive use of the voice - over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could.<br /><br />The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies , but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love . < br /><br />The revolution , like the film JULIE , never seems to have an ending .
1 Harvey Keital 's best performance so far the new century . Very nicely photographed , a beautiful snap - shot of pre - Castro Cuba . The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections . It 's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger , much more complex world that he does n't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor , the direction is crisp . Over all , a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema . The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync - sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US . Unfortunately , this just makes the film a little less convincing . But if you can see beyond this , you will find a heartfelt trip to another world . Recommended .
1 Although some may call it a " Cuban Cinema Paradiso " , the movie is closer to a How Green Was My Valley , a memory film mourning for a lost innocence . The film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides ( pro - Castro ? anti - Castro ? , focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family . Filled with good acting , in particular from Mexican actress Diana Bracho , who plays Keitel 's wife . A masterpiece , filled with references to classic movies , from CASABLANCA to Chaplin 's CITY LIGHTS . Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story . TV director Georg Stanford Brown , in a rare return to acting ( remember THE ROOKIES ? ) , plays a homeless bum who acts as Greek chorus , superbly . It is a pity that this movie , originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA , has been released in the States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD , which has nothing to do with the movie .
1 Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way . I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise . It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution . Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end , when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy 's father . The majority of the film is the boy 's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else . There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to . A class A film with fine acting and directing . This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists . It is a film about people and their lives , their mistakes , and their triumphs . A good film worth watching several times annually .
1 Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script , and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana . To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre . The director 's cut was 3 and a half hours long . It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand . It was the second film of Gael García Bernal ( the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director . In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear . Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid . They are great actresses and they keep the story together specially Diana . Check her out in other things you would be surprised .
1 I 've watched this movie twice now on DVD , and both times it did n't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude . It seems more like a depiction of reality than most other Hollywood fare , especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed . Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint , it does n't fail to question it , and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost , not matter what , and cruelty is a common denominator.<br /><br />What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over - dramatize . Nowadays truly good movies ( in a nutshell ) are few and far apart , with mainstream fare being enjoyable ( if you do n't have high expectations ) , but terribly commercially spirited . I think this movie comes off as a truly good movie ( without being a masterpiece ) , because it sticks to itself , and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it , instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence . This movie is cool , observant , and generally light - handed in its judgement , which is GOOD.<br /><br />The story has its flaws , especially Jewel 's Character comes off doubtfully , but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic , that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life , even by liberally taking each next guy . Still she does n't come off as weak , in fact I think she 's one of the stronger characters , she 's always in control of the relationships , with the men just tagging . And I take it very gratefully that she 's not a weeping widow . I believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now . You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries , so the prospect of of someone dying , while surely causing grief , did n't traumatise people like it does now . People did n't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now , and I like that attitude.<br /><br />My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie , if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare . Do n't watch if if you want non - stop action or heart - renting emotion .
1 Easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire . But do n't watch this movie expecting to be " entertained . " Ang Lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War . What is beautiful about the movie , like all of Lee 's films , is that he does n't " side " with his characters . He creates characters , embodies them with life , problems , and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable . This film has action , but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters , it is real . And as you would expect about one of mankind 's most horrific wars , the violence is horrific.<br /><br />But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the Civil War , it is a masterpiece . Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism ? Lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the Blue and the Grey . Neither is about idealism , though , as seen in Gone with the Wind . It is about freedom , about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it . As you watch the characters , you will ask yourself " how can they be fighting to preserve slavery ? " The fact is , I do n't think they really are , and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the Civil War.<br /><br />The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to " home " though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values . The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle . Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits . And when the tension finally snaps , and these characters find themselves suddenly " free " ... we see the birth of new men.<br /><br />All this mixed in with Lee 's beautiful incorporation of humankind 's environment with breathtaking vistas and frames . Lee has a style which is his , somehow European in its " art " ( a slow camera , unrushed ) , Asian in its epic - ness and development of story , and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in North Americans.<br /><br />Relax , let go of your preconceptions about what the Civil War is , what the " western " as a genre is , what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you into a world so fragile , so hard , so real that few of us can comfortably see it.<br /><br />In this , Lee continues what he wrought in Ice Storm . Again , the movie is slow paced and without apparent " direction " ... a sure sign of Lee 's ability to direct without " imposing " himself on the story or screen . His direction is amplified by what he brings out of Jewel ( yes , the singer ) , a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.<br /><br />A movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic .
1 < br /><br />In anticipation of Ang Lee 's new movie " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , " I saw this at blockbuster and figured I 'd give it a try . A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch . Luckily though , I had a good feeling about this director . This movie was wonderfully written . The dialogue is in the old southern style , yet does n't sound cornily out of place and outdated . The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie . Toby Maguire was awesome . I thought he was good ( but nothing special ) in Pleasantville , but here he shines . I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor ( but nothing special ) , but here he is excellent as well . The big shocker for me was Jewel . She was amazingly good . Jeffrey Wright , who I had never heard of before , is also excellent in this movie . It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand . A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa . This movie had the perfect combination . The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular . This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others . It lets you really get to know the characters , which are all very dynamic and interesting . The plot is complex , and keeps you on the edge of your seat , guessing , and ready for anything at any time . Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were " too quiet " ( brilliant directing ) . This was also a beautifully shot movie . The scenery was not breath taking ( It 's in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez ) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings . Has that rough and rugged feel , but keeps an elegance , which is very pleasant on the eyes . The movie was deep . It told a story and in doing so made you think . It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story . Specifically , it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for . There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie , too many to pick out . It was like a beautifully written short story , filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done . If you like great acting , writing , lots of action , and some of the best directing ever , see this movie ! Take a chance on it .
1 This movie is one of the sleepers of all time . I gave it a 10 rating . The story is of the famed ' Bushwhackers ' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States . The clothing they wore were authentic , the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched . There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted ... but not bad for Hollywood . The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them . I suspect it was a combination of great directing , super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors . Not just one or two ... this movie really jelled ! It has action , romance , suspense , good guys and bad guys ( sometimes depending on your individual perspective ) and history all rolled into one movie . Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel . And she 's good !
1 Taiwanese director Ang Lee , whose previous films include ' Sense and Sensibility ' and ' The Ice Storm ' , turned to the American Civil War for his latest feature . Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell , it follows the exploits of a group of Southern guerrillas , known as bushwhackers , as they fight their Northern equivalents , the jayhawkers in the backwater of Missouri.<br /><br />As one might expect , there is plenty of visceral action , but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family . Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) is such a man , or rather , boy , as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri . He is the son of a German immigrant , but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a Unionist , he joins his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles ( Skeet Ulrich ) and rides with the bushwhackers . Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men , he remains loyal to the cause . So does his friend Daniel Holt ( Jeffrey Wright ) , a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the South.<br /><br />Lee handles the subject with aplomb , never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting . The action is unglamorised and admirably candid , recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities.<br /><br />The performances are superb , with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified . Up - and - coming Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a cold - blooded killer , while Skeet Ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant . Lee never flinches from the reality of war , but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship , the demonstration of courage and , on a wider scale , the emancipation of oppressed peoples . Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience .
1 For those who commented on The Patriot as being accurate , ( Which basically satanised the English ) , it was interesting to see this film . By all accounts this was the bloodiest war that Americans have ever been involved in , and they were the only nationality present . It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint America as either martyrs or saviours . All in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict , and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts , often culminating in the suffering of the innocent . This was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all .
1 Strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in Denmark , so I had to wait for the video release . My expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed . As always with Ang Lee there is fantastic acting , an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming . Along with Unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90`s.<br /><br />People who expect something along the line of Mel Gibson in The Patriot(corny ) or Braveheart(acceptable ) will be sourly disappointed , all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it . 9 out of 10 .
1 The War Between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America ; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed , and in all probability never will . And , as in any story about any war , beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving . It is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective , which is what director Ang Lee provides in ` Ride With the Devil , ' a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the War itself , and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the War , the infamous raid on Lawrence , Kansas , by Quantrill and his raiders , which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the Confederate point - of - view.<br /><br />In 1863 , the Union influence predominates in the State of Kansas , and even across the border in neighboring Missouri , those with Confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching Northerners , especially without the aid of what could be considered any ` regular ' Confederate troops . And when things begin to really heat up around their own town , Jack Bull Chiles ( Skeet Ulrich ) and Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) form a band of their own and join in the fray , doing damage to the Union cause wherever it is practicable . Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing ; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right . < br /><br />There are others , however , even among their own , men like the young Pitt Mackeson ( Jonathan Rhys - Meyers ) , who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality , perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims . And so , for Jack Bull and Jake , as well as many just like them , it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested ; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood . And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself , against seemingly insurmountable odds.<br /><br />As with all of his films , director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive , yet subtle examination of the traditions , cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting . And in so doing , Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers , perhaps , a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged . Whether it 's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters ( ` Eat Drink Man Woman ' ) , the effects of class distinction ( ` Sense and Sensibility ' ) , the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies ( ` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ' ) or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above ( ` The Ice Storm ' ) , Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level . This film is no exception ; and ( as he does with all his films ) , Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography ( in this film , by Frederick Elmes , who also did ` The Ice Storm ' brilliantly ) , which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry . It 's that special Lee touch , and it adds a wistful , reflective sense to whatever story he is telling , which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.<br /><br />As Jake , Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops , and his character along with it . Most importantly , Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him , which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation : His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those ` murdered ' in the various skirmishes and battles ; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere , even in such troubled times ; the betrayal , which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace ; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly . It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance , and it is no small accomplishment . It is , however , the kind of studied , understated performance that is often taken for granted , which is unfortunate ; work like this is worthy of acclaim , and should be recognized.<br /><br />Skeet Ulrich is effective , as well , as Jack Bull , and Jewel ( in her motion picture debut ) turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley . It is Jeffrey Wright , however , who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt , as well as Jonathan Rhys - Meyers , who brings a chilling Christopher Walken - like menace to his role of Pitt . Also , in what amounts to a cameo role ( one scene ) , Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes James Caviezel ( Black John ) , Simon Baker ( George Clyde ) , Tom Guiry ( Riley ) , Tom Wilkinson ( Orton Brown ) , John Ales ( Quantrill ) , John Judd ( Otto Roedel ) and Kathleen Warfel ( Mrs. Chiles ) . The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation ; but hopefully , as time goes on , it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like ` Ride With the Devil ' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing . In light of more recent events , it is something that is sorely needed , worldwide . Film is a powerful medium ; it can be educational as well as entertaining , and perhaps in the future more filmmakers , like Ang Lee , will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are . 8/10 . < br /><br / > < br /><br / > < br /><br / >
1 Ride With the Devil has something rich and special , if you can stand the slow development . While tackling a dark , gritty subject , the brutal guerrilla war in the American West during its Civil War ( which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s ) , the movie maintains a strangely satisfying , unmanipulated atmosphere . What I 'm refering to is the tendency of films ' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you 'd expect to feel . But RWTD instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack , and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer 's senses.<br /><br />As an enthusast of this particular area of CW history , I 'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film . The diologue is expertly written , ( even with subtle humor occasionally ) with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles ( Independence for example ... A far cry from the Oregon Trail ! ) . The minor events that occur to Jake 's band are similar to actual events that took place ... Especially the attack when they 're holed up in the house , and the destruction of the store / booth . The battle scenes , though rare , are pretty well executed . It even has the first CW cavalry battle put on film recently.<br /><br />The directing shows the talent everyone expects of Ang Lee in subtle ways . Example : The character of Black John is shown taunting a Lawrence resident during the massacre : " Where 's your army ? Who are we to fight ! ? Who are we to fight ? ! ( The shot then switches to a trio of Confederate Regulars standing , doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues ) You are cowards all ! " Who are the cowards , really ? Little touches like that really enhance the movie 's quality.<br /><br />There are no major glaring areas in the history , something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film Glory , which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows . Some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented do n't add up . But you will never notice that . A larger curiosity is the fact that the only African - American man - at - arms character in the film is the quasi - slave fighting for Jake and his Confederate bushwhackers . It is true that some blacks did fight for the Confederacy out there , including one who scouted Lawrence for Quantrill before the attack ( Who would suspect him ? ) . Though this black rebel is a fasinating character ( whatever PC African - Americans might think of him ) , not a single black Union infantryman is seen in the film , which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the Western CW . One of the first black regiments of the CW was raised in Kansas ( by the murderer Senator Jim Lane , and before the 54th Mass. Reg . of fame was organized ) , and black troops in such battles as Baxter Springs , KS , played a critical role.<br /><br />No glaring historical errors . Good , realistic action , which is infrequent and not gratitous . Good Directing . This film may not be the blockbusters other recent Civil War were , but it 's the cleanest job of any .
1 Ride with the Devil , like Ang Lee 's later Brokeback Mountain , is a film of aesthetic and historical importance . Film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended . < br /><br />A perfect piece of art , surprising depth of humanity . I really do n't recall another war film , will so capture you , will change your existing conception of history and politics , will restore your belief in humanity . After seeing so many killings , so many sufferings , you do n't feel yourself numb , instead you treasure the bond between human beings more . The actors ' performances haunt your heart , the music drives your mind . Some shoots , are not just some pictures , they transcend themselves , becoming the seeing of soul . Such is the true sense of film being a genre of art.<br /><br />A film like this does n't need long comments or reviews , everything it says by itself . Ovation to the cast which includes Tobey Maguire , Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher , the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music , what an achievement !
1 After seeing all the Jesse James , Quantrill , jayhawkers , etc films in the fifties , it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee . The scene of the attack of Lawrence , Kansas is awesome . The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys - Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy . All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war , and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours . Definitely worth seeing .
1 Ride With The Devil directed by Ang Lee(Crouching Tiger ) is another gem in this fine directors cap . For those unfamiliar with the history of the Kansas - Missouri border wars during the American Civil War . See this film & you will visit a sad piece of Americana . Besides some superb action scenes ( quite bloody at times ) . This is a story of love & devotion between men & one lady in particular . It stars Toby Maguire , Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright & as the young lady Jewel , I never heard or seen her before , I want to see more of her).The acting is top notch , superb production values , very well written ( adapted from a novel)<br /><br / > This is a long film 128 minutes , but well worth seeing.<br /><br / > my rating is * * * * < br /><br / > respectively submitted < br /><br />Jay Harris < br /><br / >
1 The star of this film is the screenplay . Attention to detail for the period in dress , language , social mores ( we do n't hurt women ) and the politics are remarkable . It is a reminder of Kosovo to - day . The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb . Perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received . It is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step . A great film ....
1 The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is with but one word : authenticity . I will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film , but I would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer.<br /><br />As a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film , I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding " bleeding Kansas " . Yes there were liberties taken on the actual events , as all fiction is apt to do . But the overall feel of the film is genuine . Authentic costumes , authentic attitudes ( no PC hindsight here ) even the actors look authentic . Even Jewel Kilcher ( who has a small part in the film ) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph.<br /><br />A few viewers I talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog . They can not believe that 19th century farmers would " talk like poets".<br /><br />What they do n't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness , the American public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch . These people were raised on Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible . The screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people , judging from documentation of the time . The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />But in addition to a historical document , this film works on a visceral level as well . Beautifully photographed and performed , it harkens back to the days of the great western epics . The raid on Lawrence , Kansas , done so many times before in so many other , lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action.<br /><br />Romance , adventure , moral and ethical conflict . This film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want . < br /><br />In a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like American Beauty , this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system . But I am certain that Ride With The Devil will be given it 's due in the coming years . Please rent this film . You will not be disappointed .
1 When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee , I made sure to see it . This Taiwanese director burst into fame with " The Wedding Banquet " and " Eat Drink Man Woman " a few years ago and then moved on to " Sense and Sensibility " and " The Ice Storm " . Now , he turns his attention to another American icon -- the Civil War.<br /><br />This story takes place in Missouri , a Union state with Southern sympathies . These never officially joined the Confederate army . Instead , they formed outlaw bands , called " bushwhackers " , grew they hair long , and sometimes would confiscated Union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing.<br /><br />The movie depicts their moral dilemma , the high drama of the times , and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the Union . There are no stars in this movie , unless you consider " Jewel " the singer , well cast as a young confederate widow as a star.<br /><br />Tobey Macquire is cast as a young German farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the Germans were supposed Union sympathizers . This young man is an excellent actor , full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he 's exposed to the horror of war.<br /><br />Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom . He gives a fine and understated performance.<br /><br />Some of the acting , however , is wooden , especially in the long conversations they have about morality . And their costumes are too new . And the " southern gentleman " theme of manners and hat - tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women 's arms , then burn down the stores and houses.<br /><br />While I do n't think that this will go down as one of Lee Ang 's " great " movies , I did find myself fascinated by it , in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes . I was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history.<br /><br />Not as much action as the usual war movie , but yet still recommended -- especially for Civil War buffs.<br /><br / >
1 An unconventional historical drama , with some fine battle scenes . Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance , and gets some pretty good back - up . The script is literate and pretty original , and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes . That said , it does drag a bit , and the last reel is too much like a TV mini - series . Still , Frederick Elmes 's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits ( and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch ) . Worth seeing .
1 I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Myers ( misspelled ) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles . As was Jeffery Wright . Toby McGuire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted , when he had to amputate his best friend 's arm , knowing he would die without the procedure . < br /><br />Attention to detail , with good dialect coaching to catch the Southern accent incredibly well.<br /><br />Why this movie was swept under the rug by the Hollywood promoters I can only imagine . I have strong suspicions . Which makes it all the more appealing to me . I have given a dozen DVD copies out for presents.<br /><br />Completely overlooked movie . Rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours , then judge .
1 One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers , an observation which mystifies me . Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee , it had many young actors who were to become major stars , e.g. , Tobey Maguire ( before Spiderman ) , Skeet Ulrich ( before Jericho ) , Jonathan Rhys Meyers ( before Tudors ) , James Caviezel , Simon Baker , Mark Ruffalo , Jeffrey Wright , Tom Wilkinson , and Jewel . All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances , especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award ) and the actors are listed , this film is usually omitted from their past performances . I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films . However , it is seldom every seen on cable . I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known .
1 So , neighbor was killing neighbor . Reminds me of Iraq . As I watched the American flag ( 50 stars in 1864 ? ) being dragged behind the horse , I realized why burning that piece of red white and blue does n't upset me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights . I 'm a Southerner , and must have some historical memory.<br /><br />Watching the Tobey McGuire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave , as he looks at the scalps of blacks and Germans ( his ethnic background ) being wagered at a poker game ..... was interesting . Many twists in this movie . The wife , who is forced into her marriage , shows both lust and a strong will , characteristics we 're not used to seeing in ' respectable Victorian southern belles'.<br /><br />The crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin , head of the Copeland Horse - thieving Gang , Inc. in Mississippi , was hung about that time . Bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside , armed . Remind you of Iraq ? And how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background ? And why southerners are STILL fighting that civil war today.<br /><br />Too bad we ca n't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we 've just invaded and are occupying , fomenting civil war everywhere . That 's Mesopotamia , now called Iraq , who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil . The wild - eyed killers in Missouri , raiding Lawrence , Kansas could as easily be the insurgents we 're fighting now with no success.<br /><br />Another anomaly was the father 's tribute to the Yankees who move into Lawrence and erect a school " even before they erect a church . And for that reason , they 'll win . " Huh ? ? ? ? ? I was taught history in Birmingham , Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer ..... that 's why they won . Course , they also LITERALLY had God on their side . As you see here , when the freed slave indicates that he 's cutting out to free his mother , sold into slavery in Texas . God , what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.<br /><br />Acting pretty good , lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle ( but did n't hear any rebel yells , so reminiscent of football games in Alabama ) . You also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was , as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid . They have lost sight of why they 're fighting , and so do we . Just more mindless slaughter.<br /><br />You're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from Iraq , as the bushwacker ( ahh , what connotations ) first has his arm seared shut , trying to save it , then has it amputated , and then dies . So much suffering for such a stupid cause.<br /><br />The cinematography is fantastic . Now I have to get back to the DVD and get the production notes , one of my favorite parts of any movie . I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal , as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era , if you knew History . The dialogue is definitely thought - provoking . Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie , by any means . You see the wounded but still active - duty soldiers , still fighting cause they have nothing else to do . You see the southern raiders , living off the land , stealing indiscriminately . Yet , at the beginning , you 've seen the battle stop , so the women could be evacuated from danger . As I read the escalating number of women and children dying in Iraq , I 'm thinking , " Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people ? " I have forgotten why I sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years , but some book somewhere lauded it . With good reason . Tobey at his best , pre - Spideyman . Buy the DVD or rent it . And tell me why others laud this , not just liberals cest moi .
1 Ang Lee clearly likes to ease into a film , to catch action , characters and setting on the hoof , as they emerge . Covering the haphazard endgame of the American civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia , unformed in mind or manhood , this is an ideal approach . The film turns out to be about the formation of personalities , adulthood and relationships . Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid - south as a silent character , enduring the strife like a hardy parent.<br /><br />James Schamus ' script is probably the standard bearer for this film ; close behind it are a number of well - appointed performances that carry it admirably . Jeffrey Wright 's name alone could carry this film for me . He 's brilliant here but in a slow burning role : instead we are treated to very good ( if not revelatory ) performances from a large , often recognisable ensemble.<br /><br />A noble , optimistic film . One to watch if you do n't fancy the harder , more bittersweet Cold Mountain or The Claim , for example . 7/10
1 I enjoyed this film very much . Tobey Maguire gives a terrific performance as Jake . He has got to be one of the best actors I have seen . And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film . He was extremely good at this too although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before . The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all . I did not know what to expect from Jewel 's performance but I think she did rather well . Lots of exciting scenes . A thoroughly good ride . I am absolutely a fan of Maguire 's . Check out Cider House Rules . One of the all time Best Ever .
1 You 're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse . I rated the Audie Murphy movie a 3 ( I 'm a harsh grader ) , the second lowest I ever gave Audie ( the worst being " Battle at Bloody Beach " if you 're curious ) . I give this movie a rating of " 8 " ( and I 'm a harsh grader ) It 's the Civil War story of renegade " soldiers " , if you want to call them that , against the North . People like Quantrell , and the men who rode with these outlaws.<br /><br />The original was a watery version , very clean cut , while still depicting the horror of what these men did . Actually , movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences , who can discern the story . I would be more apt to rate the original " R " and this one , with it 's gruff nature , a GP , because the newer movie gives a very honest version , a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version.<br /><br />Film makers since the early sixties have boasted about " Realism " , but few of them deliver . Instead , they just give the drab scenery , drab costumes , and drab events , but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters , the weakness of the spaghetti era.<br /><br />Modern film makers have realized this mistake . It is evident in a superior style of Western we usually see today . This movie is an example . It gives the realistic settings , but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era.<br /><br />It has a few lulls , which makes a complete sit through a bit hard , and it has some unexplained situations . But unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up , and the characters are intriguing enough.<br /><br />It begins a bit campy , but really improves . The main character is one we can identify , and at least have some sympathy for . The Audie Murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy , and is too self righteous without motivation.<br /><br />The character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti - hero . There is motivation , and a method to his madness . We never feel he is truly " right " , but we can understand where he comes from.<br /><br />There is plenty of action in the movie . There is also some humor . One good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she would n't lie to him , and he mulls that over.<br /><br />This movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades . This director and writer team got it right.<br /><br />Recommended . Complete success .
1 In the process of trying to establish the audiences ' empathy with Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) the filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawkers . Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invading force . The Southerners fought for State 's Rights : the right to own slaves , elect crooked legislatures and judges , and employ a political spoils system . There 's nothing noble in that . The Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army.<br /><br />It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity . When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers , it 's not because he saw error in his way , he certainly does n't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition .
1 From the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast , to the intelligently written ( and very quotable ) script , from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by Carter Burwell , Rob Roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences : one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area.<br /><br />There have been several comparisons made with Braveheart , which came out the same year . With all due credit to Mel Gibson , Braveheart struck me as too much of a self - conscious and preachy epic to rival Rob Roy as the kind of movie I would care to see more than once . While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic , Rob Roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling . Not a single scene is wasted.<br /><br />Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension , action and even occasional humor . The characters are well fleshed - out , perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.<br /><br />Further , they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.<br /><br />For example , while we hope the heroic Rob Roy prevails , we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor . Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema , yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is . Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.<br /><br />Rob Roy is a delightful treasure , featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation .
1 Michael Caton - Jones 's Scottish period piece bears little connection to the Sir Walter Scott novel of the same name ... <br /><br />The film opens in the Scottish highlands , with Robert Roy McGregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of His Lordship James Graham 's cattle ... The scene then switches to a sword - fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs , adorned shirts , soft colored coats , paleface make - up and conventional gestures ... <br /><br />MacGregor lives under the protection of a local lord named Marquis of Montrose ... When he enters an ill - advised trade agreement with Montrose , he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of Montrose 's evil - doers ... The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie , though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape ... When Rob Roy is finally compelled to rebel against the English soldiers , the action becomes well understood , ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade ... <br /><br />Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character ... He is intelligent , fair and virile ... He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chieftain of a small community ... He is a loving father , a passionate lover , and a noble husband , driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains ... He 'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust ... < br /><br />Oscar winner Jessica Lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife , a proud peasant woman , brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat ... Lange 's lines are filled with dignity and integrity : ' I will think on you dead , until my husband makes you so . And then I will think on you no more.'<br /><br />John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make Montrose something more than a greedy Marquis , ruthless with money and tempered by the English court 's fashion for foppery ... He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service ... Honor , in his view , seems a quaint notion ... He has two objectives : ruin the reputation of his rival , the Duke of Argyle , and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor ... He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders ' homes , to kill their people and their livestock ... <br /><br />Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero , is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer ... He is a penniless British aristocrat , a nasty ' hired sword ' wonderfully evil , ravishing and murdering his way through the Scottish mist ... His name is Archibald Cunningham ... He turns out to be a liar , a thief and a murderer ... He dismisses himself as ' but a bastard abroad , seeking his fortune and the favors of great men , " and therefore ca n't care about anyone else : " Love is a dung hill and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow . " He even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl ... <br /><br />Cunningham seems pathetic ... He smiles foolishly , and utters words with affected refinement , but not terribly harmful - until a muscular swordsman insults him , and we discover that he 's a cool head and an expert with a sword ... He really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination ... <br /><br />And while Brian Cox is suitably odious as Killearn , Andrew Keir is Montrose 's rival , the powerful local aristocrat , the Duke of Argyll , one of the few trustworthy men McGregor meets outside his own family ... < br /><br />Set in 18th - century Scotland , and with an atmospheric musical score , ' Rob Roy ' is really a love story between a man and his wife , a recognizably human story , unjustly dwarfed by Mel Gibson 's ' Braveheart , ' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing English landlords ...
1 This is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective . While the story is simple it is pure and straightforward . In truth , it is the standard story of a simple , honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.<br /><br />Poor vs. Rich , honorable vs. dishonorable , a classic but well - told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.<br /><br />Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen . :)
1 This is one powerful film . The first time I saw it , the Scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience . I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD , used the English subtitles when I needed them , and really got into this movie , discovering just how good it is . It is excellent.<br /><br />The widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts , with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of Braveheart , an involving tale of good versus evil . Here , it 's Liam Neeson ( good ) vs. Tim Roth ( evil ) . Both do their jobs well.<br /><br />Few actors come across as despicable as Roth . Man , you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant , irritating puss . ( He is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else 's here ) . Neeson is a man 's man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart . Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead . The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved , so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this .
1 What can one say about a film that has one of the blackest , most nihilistic , and occasionally most weirdly -I wo nt say ' sympathetic' .. I will say ' charismatic ' villains in the history of the Cinema , and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday ? This is an epic about a stubborn , sometimes foolish , incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny . I loved it . John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains . Jessica Lange was very moving , tender , and sensual .
1 MAJOR SPOILERS ! ! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE!!<br /><br />Commenters have touched on the major theme of " honor " in the film , and too many comparisons to " Braveheart . " I 'll point out a few things about this movie that I have not seen other comments touch on:<br /><br />This movie has a decidedly different take on abortion . The first character to get pregnant is the villain 's ( Roth ) girlfriend , and when he coldly suggests an abortion , she states it is too late for that . The shame of her situation ( " I 'm to have a bastard 's bastard . " ) leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene . The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary , Rob 's wife , after a rape by Roth 's character ( and at least one sex scene with her husband , Rob ) . Late in the movie , as Rob is leaving for a final confrontation with Roth , Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins , with a tone hinting of abortion . Rob replies in a noble tone , " it 's not the fault of the child , " and then states what he thinks the name should be , girl or boy . I find this " pro - life " stance on the part of the hero to be very un - Hollywood . Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism.<br /><br />Another related theme is Roth 's character is a bastard , someone who evidently does not know who his father was , and has few kind words for his mother , though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck . Is it coincidence that Roth ( devoid of family stability ) is the walking definition of psychopath , while Rob is the strong husband / father figure , and of course the hero . In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain ( Roth ) , the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest , over the heart . His employer and pseudo - father figure ( John Hurt character ) holds the mother 's picture in his hand and gazes at it , before snatching it from the neck of the dead Roth.<br /><br />Also what I find interesting was the direction of the rape scene , which was not quite graphic but neither was it off - camera and implied . I found it surprising in it 's somewhat matter of fact depiction , with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal , and subsequent post traumatic stress ( as we call it now ) . My point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied , which I find an interesting middle road for Hollywood to take.<br /><br />In the final fight scene , I have to correct an earlier commenter : The weapon Roth chose was a rapier ( or perhaps a short sword ) , the weapon Rob chose was a Claymore . Someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene . Roth would have the upper hand in such a situation , but of course the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon . What is even more striking to me ( as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject ) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made : The actors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights ( including the movies opening fight ) . Even more true to history , Roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon , which is it 's purpose by design ! ( Rapiers were edged , but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust . ) Rob uses the Claymore in broad slashes , as it 's design intent . The fight goes down as I would expect it to -- Roth effectively wins . Though Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth 's weapon ( more symbolism ) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut.<br /><br />Folks , it is RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight.<br /><br />I'll also note that for whatever reason , I remember 1995 ( the year of release ) distinctly as a time of distrust of the U.S. government . Hollywood was obviously tuned into that , with the release of both " Rob Roy " and " Braveheart , " and I think the anti - government leanings are why both films get so much comparison . < br /><br />I think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans , tired of the same old , not so hidden messages from Hollywood .
1 * * Attention Spoilers**<br /><br />First of all , let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90 's . It was an amazing achievement for all those involved , especially the acting of Liam Neeson , Jessica Lange , John Hurt , Brian Cox , and Tim Roth . Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves . But alas ... <br /><br />it constantly , and unfairly gets compared to " Braveheart " . These are two entirely different films , probably only similar in the fact that they are both about Scots in historical Scotland . Yet , this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that " Braveheart " is a better film than " Rob Roy " . I like " Braveheart " a lot , but the idea of comparing it to " Rob Roy " is a little insulting to me . To put quite simply , I love " Braveheart " , but it is a pale shadow to how much I love " Rob Roy " . Here are my particular reasons ... <br /><br />-"Rob Roy " is about real people.<br /><br />Let 's face it , the William Wallace in " Braveheart " is not a real person . He 's a legend , a martyr , a larger than life figurehead . Because of this depiction , he is also a perfect person , never doing wrong , and basically showing his Scot countrymen to the promised land . When he finally does fail , it is not to his fault . Like Jesus , he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most . He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.<br /><br />The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective . But it really does n't inspire or intrigue me . I find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection . That is why " The Last Temptation of Christ " is a better film than " King of Kings " , and that is also one of the reasons why I think " Rob Roy " is better than " Braveheart " . Rob Roy may be heroic and brave , but he is far from perfect . He makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones . Now sure , not bearing false claim against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage , but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness . Let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act . But Rob did the best he could , and that was all you could ask of him.<br /><br />Rob 's Wife Mary , is also a normal , ambigious person . Let us start though , with how she looks in this film . Sure , she 's beautiful , but she does n't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show . Compare this with the two loves ( or one , depending on your point of view ) of William Wallace in " Braveheart " . Now these two ladies are hot , but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time ( especially the lay persons ) . Maybe not a fair comparison , but just another example of how Rob Roy 's attempts for accuracy are far more effective.<br /><br />Throughout " Rob Roy " , Mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion , Cunningham . She feels compelled to tell Rob of her struggle , but does n't because she knows that Rob must seek revenge for her rape . Such revenge would surely mean the death of Rob , and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.<br /><br />The villains in " Rob Roy " are equally as compelling . Although the enemies in " Braveheart " are well written , they are hardly original . Robert the Bruce , a man both brave and cowardly , is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm . Should he take his claim as the king of Scotland , or should he betray Wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name ? Bruce is the most ambigious character in " Braveheart " , but from Brutus in " Julius Ceasar " to Fredo in " The Godfather Part II " , these types of characters are hardly original . Longshanks , although a compelling villain in his own right , is very one dimensional . He is the epidemy of evil , and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to Wallace 's heroism.<br /><br />"Rob Roy " has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery . First of all , let 's start with Marquis of Montrose . He is a man who is so obsessed with his self image , that he 's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it . " See to it that I am not mocked " are his favorite words to his " factor " . He is a man obsessed with power , upset that a man of great noble bearing as the Duke of Argyll can be considered of greater providency then him . He is shamefully self obsessed and insecure . He is an evil aristocrat , but in ways that make him unique.<br /><br />Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators in " Rob Roy " , and are also Roy 's direct assailants . Callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical . He will do anything to maintain the good will of the Marquis , which includes backstabbing and trickery . Cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the Marquis . He needs a father , little does he know that the Marquis is his real father . Therefore , when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn , he grabs it without even questioning it . He is very much like the evil of modern man , so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.<br /><br />Many have criticized Tim Roth 's performance in this film as overacting . Hogwash I say . It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film . In a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement , is Cunningham too much of an unbelievable character ? We live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life . " Rob Roy " simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed . It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion . Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will prevail , but snakes will always exist in our world.<br /><br />Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll . He is a true nobleman , and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis . He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary , and has a direct vexation for the Marquis and his factor . He gives the world hope for the people of power . Hopefully , people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule.<br /><br />- The final duel in " Rob Roy " is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in " Braveheart".<br /><br />One thing I get tired of is people telling me that " Braveheart " is a better film because of the battle scenes . First of all , battle scenes are hardly original . From " Spartacus " to " Gladiator " , Hollywood has had a long tradition of historical European battle scenes . " Braveheart " has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film , but they suffer from one important problem . These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.<br /><br />Now , do n't get me wrong , duels are hardly original either . In fact , there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes . But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold . It is one of the greatest scenes in film history . Let me explain why ... <br /><br />First of all , the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly . Cunningham is effette and dangerous , Rob Roy is strong and courageous . Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a broadsword . Cunningham fights with quick tricky movements , while Roy 's fighting style is more obvious.<br /><br />The whole film , from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half , is leading up to this moment . It is powerful stuff , and it is clear that Rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world . When Rob finally gets the upper hand ( literally and figuratively , ) it is one of the greatest moments in film history . Rob wins because he has more to live for , and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham 's . The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene . Good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell " FREEDOM ! " . But hey , maybe that 's just me.<br /><br />- " Rob Roy " is more realistic than " Braveheart" < br /><br />I do n't know that people in the aristocracy or Scotsmen talked like the people in " Rob Roy " , but I do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns . I feel that many people are bored by " Rob Roy " simply because they ca n't understand what the characters are saying . If this is the case , then read some Shakesphere , or put on the close - captioning . " Rob Roy " is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90 's . Many of the dialogue in this film is clever , but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.<br /><br />By contrast , the dialogue in " Braveheart " is hardly very interesting . Of course , what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian ? This is a legend , and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times . This film takes place several centuries before " Rob Roy " , and yet they talk like the people today . Thus the reason that many people like it better . Audiences today have become increasingly lazy , and they do n't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex . Therefore , as with many epic films , they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable English accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our American language . Sure , it is clear that the Wallace is Scotish , but other than sounding like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of " Aye"s for acknowledgement , the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe Scots should sound.<br /><br />So , do these descriptions prove that " Rob Roy " is a better film than " Braveheart " ? Hardly . But if it proves one thing , it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that " Braveheart " is a better film than " Rob Roy " . To put simply , " Rob Roy " is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today 's world . " Braveheart " is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic . You can make a decision on what you think is better ... <br /><br />Grade - A Score - 9
1 Overshadowed by " Braveheart " released the same year , the two costume dramas beg comparison . I admit my bias against Mel Gibson , yet I maintain a rational preference for " Rob Roy . " Both " Braveheart " and " Rob Roy " compellingly depict Scots history in bloody , romantic fashion . " Braveheart " is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy . It 's also melodramatic , anachronistic and maudlin . Note its cornball usage of slow motion filming . Its violence is both ugly and glorious . It is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset . While " Braveheart " surpasses " Rob Roy " in sheer levels of carnage ( not to mention its indulgent running time ) , the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying . Its action is more understated , yet more surprising and clever . Its sex is less showy , yet more erotic . " Rob Roy " also has a better realized romantic interest . Its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period . Its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era . And Tim Roth is a superlative villain . Also recommended : " The Last of the Mohicans " and " The Patriot . " You may find the latter more akin to " Braveheart " with its emphasis on blood lust , with the former more similar to " Rob Roy " in tone . All the of the aforementioned movies merit their R ratings for violence .
1 This sweeping drama has it all : top notch acting , incredible photography , good story . It is often compared to " Braveheart " because both movies take place in historical Scotland . Even though I love Braveheart , I think this is the better of the two films . Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance ( should have been nominated for an Oscar ) . Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role . Tim Roth plays one of the most evil , despicable , characters in film history ( he was nominated for an Oscar ) . John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose , another dislikeable character . I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play . This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan , and Lord Montrose . Rob Roy is a self made man , who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor . Montrose , who , inherited his title , has no sense of honor . And that is basically what this story is all about ; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility . This movie is very entertaining , it should appeal to all . It has romance , action , beautiful scenery , and has a exciting plot . One of my favorite films .
1 This is a very good , under - rated action / drama / and slightly historical movie.<br /><br />The basic story concerns Rob Roy 's borrowing of 1000 pounds , its theft , and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen.<br /><br />Cunningham ( Tim Roth ) is an amazing villain and character in this story . Brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil.<br /><br />Rob Roy ( Liam Neeson ) is excellent too , but i think the writers used the word " honour " 1 too many times.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is strong , and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.<br /><br />The Action is exciting and the sword play very realistic , but not too gory . The story is good and you really want Rob to win.<br /><br />All in all just shy of a classic .
1 Its not Braveheart ( thankfully),but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around . I enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week , find it has held up well over time . Not a classic film , but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment .
1 This is the moving tale of Scotland 's legendary hero , Rob Roy , and his battles with the feudal landowners . Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared , it is not very historical . Despite their primarily fictional nature , I rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two . The 13 Century William Wallace is , as others have noted , a larger than life national figure , while the early 18th Century Rob Roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary Scotsman.<br /><br />The story revolves around a clan chieftain , Robert Roy McGregor , who lives in a Scottish highland cottage with his wife Mary and their two young sons . As the movie begins , he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord 's cattle . Rob Roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand Scottish pounds from a local noble , the Marquis of Montrose , in order to buy cattle to herd to market . He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend , Alan McDonald . When both McDonald and the money turn up missing , Rob Roy finds himself in conflict with Montrose as well as his despicable protégé , Archibald Cunningham , and his sleazy factor , Killearn . Rob Roy 's honour is also tested when Montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival , the Duke of Argyle , whom he wishes to accuse of being a Jacobite.<br /><br />The charismatic Liam Leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander Rob Roy , an intelligent , virile , and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale . Personally , I feel that this is Neeson 's best performance , his brogue ( albeit Irish ) adding authenticity for the average viewer . Rob Roy is a stubborn , proud , courageous , and honest man whose word can be trusted . He is a loving husband & father , and also touchingly loyal to his friend , McDonald , who is accused of robbing him . < br /><br />Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains , Archibald Cunningham , an egotistical , ruthless strutting peacock . He is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women , whether willing or otherwise . The pathetic Cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father 's identity , though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder , rape , and thievery . Also , he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl , Betty , after she becomes pregnant with his child , resulting in her suicide . John Hurt plays the arrogant and foppish Montrose , who is eventually implied to be Cunningham 's father.<br /><br />The movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife , beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between Rob Roy and Mary . Those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife ! I think the phrase used by this pair , ' How fine you are to me ... ' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema . < br /><br />The most compelling performance is possibly by Jessica Lange as Rob 's wife , Mary McGregor . Lacking make up , she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother . The actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable Cunningham , while the disgusting Killearn looks on . Her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace . I give Hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as Mary 's pain and humiliation , but nothing intended to sensationalize . Their kinsman , Alastair McGregor , shows emotional anguish when he learns of Mary 's rape , and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by Cunningham . < br /><br />Of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the Scottish highlands , also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring . There are no grand battle scenes as in Braveheart , but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham . This is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale .
1 The early to mid 90s were a high point , in my opinion , for the historical drama . Last of the Mohicans , Braveheart , Rob Roy - all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods.<br /><br />Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by film . It really has everything - interesting story , great acting , remarkable dialog , and breathtaking scenery . I was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog . I can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved.<br /><br />Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters . I found it to be more repulsive and shocking , albeit often more subtle , than most found in films set in modern times . The movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era.<br /><br />The pace was very tight , with hardly a dull moment . There was much intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit , but yet did not detract from the main storyline.<br /><br />The action was also very well done and gripping . Something that I will forever find remarkable is that during the highlight action piece in the film , there is no soundtrack whatsoever . It makes for a very tense , exciting sequence , since we have no musical cue as to the direction and resolution of the scene.<br /><br />Rob Roy will always remain high on my list of favorite films . I would recommend it to all .
1 Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century . He is a true actor . He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles . Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary . Mary is such a beautiful woman . It 's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend , but it 's his passion that makes her love undying . They need each other . Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect ; in one way or another , upon watching the movie , you will find Cunningham disgusting . The Scotland scenery is beautiful . The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well . If you like history , romance , passion and love , you 'll enjoy Rob Roy . There is violence and blood , but it 's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told ; no gratuitous violence . And you do have to listen carefully if you 're not used to a Scottish accent . One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized ; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes . It 's their skill as actors that attracts you , they do n't rely on marquee names , popularity or sex symbol appeal . This is something special .
1 Mel Gibson 's Braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film , but it left a sour taste in the mouth . Rob Roy , by contrast , is slightly less polished , but a better film by far . This is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values , whereas Braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale . What makes this film is the cast . Liam Neeson plays the hero , in a role he basically reprised ( in a watered - down fashion ) in the Phantom Menace . The character is heroic , but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover . Admirable yet human , he commands the screen . Against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including Tim Roth 's Cunningham , obnoxious but brilliant , and John Hurt 's morally bankrupt laird . Also to praise is Jessica Lange , as Rob 's pragmatic wife : also strong and noble , but 300 years away from a modern heroine , which is only as it should be . This is not the most original film you will see , but it has the courage of its own convictions , and the strong performances make you care .
1 To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart . Though it is a very different kind of film , the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well . Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set , but some things never seemed to change . Scottland is still run by English nobles , and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them . Rob Roy is handsomely done , but not the grand epic that Braveheart was . There are no large - scale battles , and the conflict here is more between individuals . And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time . Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor , and those who are truly evil.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor . He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose ( John Hurt ) . Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching , and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone . Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own . He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well - being of his community . Sounds fair enough , does n't it ? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves . One of them , known as Archibald Cunningham , is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film . Played wonderfully by Tim Roth , this man is a penniless would - be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother . This man is disgustingly effeminate , rude , heartless , and very dangerous with a sword . He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility . He rapes Macgregor 's wife and burns him out of his home . This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come . Along with another crony of the Marquis ( Brian Cox ) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts . Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened , the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt . This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead!!!!!<br /><br />Luckily for the MacGregor 's , a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all . This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed . Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace . And for most of the fight , it looks like these attributes will win out . Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished , he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner . The first time you see what happens , you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham ! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and perfectly paced . The score is quite memorable , too . The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange , who might seem to be out of her element , actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor . The film is violent , but there is n't too much gore . It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior , however . The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy . The film has no obvious flaws , thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound .
1 I question anyone saying they do n't care for this movie . Some reviewers have said it did n't have enough action , some said it was too long , etc . Do n't listen to them ! ! ! If you like Shawshank Redemption and/or Braveheart , you will definitely love this movie!<br /><br />The acting performances are superb ! Tim Roth , John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size . The Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking . It is onw of the few movies I have seen in my life ( along with Shawshank ) that was virtually flawless from casting , directing , writing , acting , etc.!!!<br /><br />I was amazed this was n't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed . I felt so passionately about it that I just registered with IMDB so I could let everyone know the real scoop . I have seen this movie about 10 times ( each time with a different person ) and everyone has loved it ! You must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning . If you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site , than you will love this movie ! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix at # 32 ? ! ? ! That should show you the age range of most reviewers here!<br /><br />This is a top 50 movie ! ! !
1 Rob Roy is and underrated epic of passion and action!SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN . Liam Neeson gives a towering performance as Rob Roy MacGregor , one of the best in his career . Jessica Lange is letter - perfect as his wife Mary . They have the most passion and chemistry I 've seen in a screen couple . John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance . Tim Roth portrays one of the great screen villains . His rape of Mary is repugnant and harrowing . He really is a magnificent bastard in this movie . The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swordfights ever . Well scripted ans scored , and Michael Caton - Jones direction is flawless . 10 out of 10 .
1 When Braveheart first came out , I was enthralled , and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film . When Rob Roy came out , I was intrigued , and although I enjoyed the film I did not think it was a great film . However , as time has gone by , my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown , and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has diminished . Braveheart is great entertainment , to be sure , but there are flaws as well . The most significant , in my view , is the unflattering portrayal of Robert the Bruce , who was without a doubt Scotland 's greatest king . Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film , which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions . I think I am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film , seen only ( at least by me ) in retrospect , that the beginnings of Mel Gibson 's egomania can be seen clearly for the first time . In contrast , Rob Roy has grown on me over the years . Partly because it largely avoids the faults I mind most in Braveheart . But also because Rob Roy is like fine wine , growing more mature and complex with each viewing .
1 A very engaging , intelligent , and well - made film . Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles superbly . The cinematography is outstanding . The fight scenes are amazing . This is a film I will enjoy watching again and again . One of my favorites .
1 I loved this movie . The scenery was breathtaking , the plot had some nice twists and turns , and the characters were well rounded . On two fronts , however , " Rob Roy " scored far above average . First , I have rarely seen a " popular " film in which the quality of dialogue was so high . There were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay . I could give numerous examples , but why should I ? Just watch the film . Second , this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more . For a drama to succeed , it needs not only a hero , but a really believable villain . If you do n't have one , there 's not much joy in rooting for the good guys . And " Rob Roy " has not one , but three -- the Earl of Montrose , his henchman Kilairn , and Archie . Not one - dimensional villains , either , but fully fleshed and very nasty . It takes a bit more patience than " Braveheart "-- there 's more dialogue , and the accents are a bit tough , but it 's a much more clever and subtle piece . ( As I said , I loved this movie ! )
1 This is a very exciting and romantic film . I have seen it several times and never get bored with it . Everything is realistic and it is a good plot . The actors are excellent Liam Neeson , Jessica Lange , Tim Roth and Brian Cox.<br /><br />I actually prefer this film to Braveheart as Braveheart contain so many historical misstakes . There is many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene . This is really good and surprising scenes.<br /><br />The music are lovely ... it really suits to the movie . The setting is amazing .
1 I have n't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . I do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of Braveheart . It is simply more realistic and has more believable characters . Ridb Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing . Also the Liam Nesson has a Celtic look about him , he looks like a Scot and more importantly looks like Rob Roy . It 's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to Mel Gibson as William Wallace . Gibson is supposedly playing a man who 's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter . The story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an underdog story . Sound anything like Braveheart ? But instead of a film that cries out " freedom " , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice . This makes it a more interesting film . Much like Gladiator . The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour . The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . The scene where Mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic . This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do . Overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . Go and see it !
1 The year 1995 , when so many people talked about the great premiere of BRAVEHEART by Mel Gibson , also saw another very fine , yet underrated movie on Scottish history , ROB ROY . Although it is a very different film , especially due to the historical period the story is set in , ROB ROY has much in common not only with marvelous BRAVEHEART but also with the very spirit of epic movies.<br /><br />It is a film that discusses similar themes , like fight for dignity , courage , honor , revenge , family being a key to happiness . It also leads us to the very bliss of Scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature . Robert Roy MacGregor ( Liam Neeson ) , the main character is a true hero ( so universal in epics ) , sort of " Scottish Robin Hood " who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords . Although he worsens his situation through the acts , has to suffer a lot , two things stay in his mind undeniably : HONOR that he is given by himself and LOVE to his woman , Mary MacGregor ( Jessica Lange ) . That leads him to unexpected events ... <br /><br />Except for the interesting content and quite vivid action , the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals . This factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe . Many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images . For me , the most splendid scene was in the Highlands when Rob Roy tells his boys what honor really means . Then , he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman . The scene he escapes Marguis of Montrose ( John Hurt ) to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual . < br /><br />Of course , there is some graphic violence , like in the duel for instance , but I do n't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films . Its justification is like any other epic 's : bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it . The most disturbing scene , for me , was the rape done on Rob Roy 's wife by the villain of the story : Archibald Cunningham ( Tim Roth ) . It 's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away . However , all the rest is O.K. Yet , there is one aspect that made me really love this movie , the performances.<br /><br />All the cast do perfect jobs , from the leading Lian Neeson who fits very well to the role of tall , brave , strong Scottish man to the supporting cast of Brian Cox who portrays wicked Killearn , a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war . Jessica Lange is very fine as Mary MacGregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film . There is chemistry between Ms Lange and Mr Neeson in many of their scenes . John Hurt , one of the best British actors , does a terrific job as Marguis of Montrose , a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means . I like that calmness of his portrayal . But the real villain is played by Tim Roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character , Archibald - a man who mocks love , who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter . But , like in any good epic , this exceptional evil must find its end ... <br /><br />And one more aspect : the musical score : such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long . The final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because I deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations . Scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect . It was , as if , my second journey to Scotland.<br /><br />ROB ROY is a very nice movie , very well directed , photographed and acted . It perhaps does not equal BRAVEHEART with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes , but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have : stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education . I really enjoyed that film , do not hesitate to call it metaphorically " highlands of entertainment " and rate it 9/10
1 I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago . With little money for entertainment , I rented it for my fiancé and I to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night . The movie I had wanted was gone , so I rented this instead , not expecting much , and was very much surprised with how good it was . I just recently watched it again , and loved it every bit as much as the first time . < br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story , it 's about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor , a cattleman and folk hero . From the little I know about the man and his story , liberties have been taken with the facts , but it 's a movie , not a textbook , and so the filmmakers can be excused . Basically , the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from . But , his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest . Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis , and Mary , his wife , suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham , a smarmy Englishman with no soul . Atrocities ensue , until , in an immensely satisfying conclusion , Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey . < br /><br />There are many great performances in this movie , but allow me to touch specifically on a few . Liam Neeson , as usual , is fantastic , a sexy beast you ca n't take your eyes off of . Honestly , this man is like ice cream : even when he 's bad he 's good . His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him , in the best way he knows how . Jessica Lange , as Mary , gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering , dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure . You just know she does n't take any b.s from Rob , or anyone else for that matter . Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald , yet somehow , it works . All the posturing and preening , combined with some wicked dialogue , result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory . Combine all of this , and the stellar work by other supporting players , with the luscious scenery of Scotland , and you have what amounts to one really , really cool movie . If you have n't seen this , I highly recommend that you do .
1 I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before " Rob Roy " came out , but the movie is definitely worth seeing . Playing the title character , Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to Oskar Schindler , and Jessica Lange also does a really good job as his wife Mary . Archibald Cunningham ( Tim Roth ) is one person very likely to make your skin crawl.<br /><br />All in all , this comes out as good as " Braveheart " ( maybe even better ) . I laugh when I think of how Hollywood released two movies almost back - to - back taking a swipe at England . Very good . Also starring John Hurt , Eric Stoltz , Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng .
1 It 's a little disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young . But this film is where Gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name.<br /><br />I'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that I really enjoyed this film , mainly because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona . She was funny , angry , vulnerable , caring , and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the Lusitania , and whose father was later killed during Woar War I. < br /><br />As the " man " of the house , Fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father 's will which would therefore allow a Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get the family home . But Fiona 's keeping a secret as to why she hates Barclay so much . Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle , flirty sister , who is married to an Englishman but craves her youngest sister 's boyfriend ( Gig Young).<br /><br />If you 're a Stanwyck fan , this is a no miss .
1 Three girls , the youngest descendents of the Gaylord family , one of America 's most royal families , are orphaned at a young age . Right before he goes off to France to fight in WWI , their father tells the oldest , Fiona , never to sell the land . By the time the sisters have become adults , they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property . Through certain loopholes in the father 's will , a man named Charles Barclay stands to gain possession of the Gaylord land , on which he wants to build a complex called Barclay Circle . Barclay is actually based on John D. Rockefeller , who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in New York so he could build Rockefeller Center.<br /><br />This film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters . Fiona , well played by Barbara Stanwyck , although it 's certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles , seems like a cold , domineering woman , and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet . Susanna , played by Nancy Coleman , is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named Gig Young . Coleman 's was my favorite performance in the film . Evelyn , played by Geraldine Fitzgerald , is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in England , but that does n't stop her from trying to steal Gig from her sister . The three sisters are developed quite well but , as is the major trend in The Gay Sisters , never well enough . Charles Barclay is played by George Brent . He is n't very good . Well , he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have , but he always seems like a scumbag in the film . When we 're asked to sympathize with him late in the film , it 's impossible . Gig Young is played by , huh ? , Gig Young . No , he 's not playing himself . What happened is that the actor , who had acted in several movies previously under his real name , Byron Barr , was pressured by Warner Brothers to change his name to something more catchy . I 'm not sure who made the final choice , but he eventually changed his screen name to Gig Young , after the character whom he plays in The Gay Sisters . Weird , eh ? Young is quite good through most of the film , but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience 's sympathy for him . In two other supporting roles , Helen Thimig and Gene Lockhart are quite good.<br /><br />The Gay Sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas . The characters are all interesting , as are their situations . Unfortunately , the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama . If it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex , fleshed out , for example , the rivalry between Evelyn and Susanna or made the flashback more intricate , the film could have been fantastic . It also could have fleshed out the prologue more , let us know more about the Gaylord family . We need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more . And the ending needed some major fixing . It basically just gives up at the end . Fiona 's problems are solved so poorly that it hurts . Whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart . It 's also far too happy . This story seems moving towards tragedy , or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss . And we still hate Barclay . And the conflict between the two sisters and Gig is never solved . As bad as Fiona 's story ends , Susanna 's , Gig 's , and Evelyn 's is even worse.<br /><br />I still liked the film . It 's thoroughly watchable , even if it does n't involve us like other great films of the era . 7/10 , mostly for its potential . It should have been remade , or the novel should have been re - adapted , at some point during the studio era . It is too dated to be remade now . The 1950s would have been the best time , during the time of films like Giant .
1 This was probably one of the most well - made films of the 40 's - Warner Bros. at the very height of their style . The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing . Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method . The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable . It 's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make " Now , Voyager " later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite , ciefly because it starred Bette Davis . IN my opinion , " The Gay Sisters " is a much better film - better made in all departments , and more interesting , complex and enjoyable . A most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is , rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper - critical perfection . Each thing has to be judged in it 's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms . Most of the complaints I 've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point . If you 're hungry for a perfect filet mignon , do n't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry . The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population . Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots , you 'd all be gleefully gratified . I 'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week !
1 In this grim melodrama , Barbara Stanwyck plays the eldest of three wealthy sisters who become orphans when their father dies in France . Threatened with the danger of losing the opulent family home , Big Sister makes a grand sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer so she can inherit her ... aunt 's fortune . A few years later , she learns that he is after the family estate and wants to tear it down so she leaves him and tries to stop him . More time passes and the husband ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has borne him a son without telling him . The part of " Gig Young " was played by actor Byron Barr who later assumed the name before he became famous.<br /><br />Anyone interested in purchasing a copy let me know by writing to me at : iamaseal2@yahoo.com
1 One woman , by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time , does n't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge - of - your - seat ... but FUTURE SHOCK is truly as thrilling as they come ! Writer / star Vivian Schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress , and enlarges them to terrifying proportions , so do n't watch this film alone !
1 Okay , this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars , but I 've voted for " 10 " to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo 's who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews . Each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers ... three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big - time Hollywood productions . Performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive , with notable turns by Bill Paxton , James Karen , Vivian Schilling and Brion James . Martin Kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe - lamp , and Lance August seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim . But overall , it 's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments . Definitely worth seeing , so judge for yourself !
1 I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival . It was beautifully done , from cinematography to the acting . It 's the story of a father and son , and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis . Beautifully written with dialog that never rings false , the film showcases the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk , among others in this outstanding cast . The film begins with the aging father ( Peter Falk)is trying to figure out why his wife ( Olympia Dukakis ) has left him . The father presents himself , unannounced , on the doorstep of his son and daughter - in - law . The father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip . They fish , play pool , watch a baseball game , get drunk , get involved in a barroom brawl , and dance with strange women . But more important , they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family . It 's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them .
1 " The Thing About my Folks " came in as a surprise . We had no idea about what to expect . The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta , and based on a screen play by one of its stars , Paul Reiser , proved to be a pleasant time at the movies . Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome , this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father , perhaps for the first time in his life , Ben sees his father for what he really is , and not the mythical figure he has in his mind.<br /><br />The film seems to be a vehicle for its star , Peter Falk , and he runs away with the movie , as it was expected . Mr. Falk , one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years , is an actor of such stature , he must be reckoned with . As Sam Kleinman , the distant father to Ben , he is a man that clearly is misunderstood , not only by Ben , but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty - seven years.<br /><br />When Muriel , the matriarch of the Kleinman clan , runs away , everyone goes into a panic because this woman , who has been the strong figure of the family , is vital to keep everyone together . Not knowing where she has gone , Sam shows up at Ben 's house confused as he feels abandoned , suddenly , by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years.<br /><br />Ben , the youngest son , takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of Manhattan into the country . The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son . Along the way , father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children . The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another ; they seem inseparable.<br /><br />Peter Falk is magnificent in the film . He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman , the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst . Mr. Falk shines as the older man and there 's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him.<br /><br />Not being a Paul Reiser fan , we must confess that as Ben Kleinman , he is right . Ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for Muriel , the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together . Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film . She makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother . Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style .. <br /><br />The film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham , and the excellent musical score by Steven Argila . Ultimately , the film shows a great team effort between its director , Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser who wrote it for the screen.<br /><br />Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience , it should please anyone .
1 I also viewed this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival . It was an excellent film about adult family relationships . Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family . It was funny , warm , poignant , and moving , as well as entertaining . A film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews . I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film . Let 's only hope they 'll have the chance . I would rate this film as one of the best movies I 've seen in a year . It contains no violence , action scenes , murders , sex , so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up . Believe me , there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value , instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given .
1 I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this # 4 . The 900 + theater was full and at the end it received a standing ovation . This was classic Peter Falk if you are a Falk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters . The film 's title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me . I am surprised this did n't make it into general release . This was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you . Maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience . A lot of people could relate to situations in this movie . This will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem . I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it .
1 So fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film festival . Upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film . Looking at the card I turned to my wife and said , " How many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb ? Only about 5 for me . " But then watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the film 's setting of New York state , I slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time . Certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film , the movie jumped to the excellent level.<br /><br />By the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the Grinch 's and I ended up giving this a superb.<br /><br />This picture is a must for anyone who has parents . No violence or nudity but some strong language .
1 I was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and seen a movie that had not been advertised . I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it . Having watched " Mad about you " , once , I was not a fan of Paul Reiser . However , I am a big fan of Peter Falk . So the spouse and I took a chance . We were both swept into this story . The beautiful scenery , the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral values that are seldom seen in movies and the world today . Not that sappy emoted junk , but real life situations from real life - like people . I even have to say , Paul Reiser was excellent , although , I still wo n't watch " Mad about you " . I do n't know where this movie has gone . I heard it was put out in limited release . It should be shared with the world . It is one of the finest movies I have seen . M.
1 My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be " Drunken Master " ( 1978 ) , followed by this film from 1985 , " Police Story . " In it , Chan plays a Hong Kong super - cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang , and is then assigned to protect the man 's girlfriend ( Brigitte Lin ) so that she can turn state 's evidence . As the story goes on , the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin , but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet , while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay . Like " Drunken Master , " " Police Story " has many of the signature stunts and over - the - top martial arts / action choreography that Chan has become famous for , climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall . In his role as director , Chan exceeds in excellence , giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action . While light on the overall slapstick humor of " Drunken Master , " at heart " Police Story " is just that , a police story , a gritty cop - thriller that would be oft - copied over the years to come.<br /><br />10/10
1 Police Story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself . Compared to other action films , Police Story makes Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like beginners . The stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb . If New Line Cinema has any sense , they would release this in theaters .
1 This is not only one of the greatest Jackie Chan films , but also one of the greatest kung - fu movies of all time.<br /><br />We've come to expect crazy stunts , and fast , creative action in Chan 's movies , and this one set the benchmark for others to follow . It 's two hours of pure entertainment , that impresses all the way through.<br /><br />As well as the superb action , we have a viable storyline and believable characters , with Chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing , mixing eastern resolution methods ( ie kicking ass).<br /><br />Overall , it 's funny , serious , entertaining and groundbreaking . A must for any kung - fu fan , whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community .
1 This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10 .. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no " good plot " or anything like that , that s ridiculous , saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot ! you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES , for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that , if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan 's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time . Porn is watched for the porn , Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION , i think you people are rating it bad because there 's no plot because you think that s how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained . Sure the middle of the movie was boring , VERY BORING , but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that . This did change the way how American action movies were created , they have even stollen scenes from this movie . If you want a true man , a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan 's , he s pure in everyway . He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park , and even in TODAYS movies . American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more . Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do . a masterpiece
1 There is one detail , which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies , but which is present here . It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too . Jackie is menacing and psychotic here . He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back ( in a usual laid - back pattern ) , but he is the one who can go and start the tumult . His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing . Every time it goes " crack ! " . I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend . It 's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen . Besides , the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall ( it also looks like a poster of " rabochiy " from our Soviet era ) and some lines in Russian on the left ( I noticed that quite accidentally ) . That looks terrific ( and nostalgic for Russian people ) . I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies . Here there 's a lot of this stuff . It 's quite amazing watching the characters falling / jumping / running / driving through all manner of panes.<br /><br />All three movies are great . I had been preparing myself to see the down - slide of the quality but I saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts ( and not only Jackie Chan 's character appears in all three movies - that 's also excellent and keeps continuity up).<br /><br />I would like to describe each movie just in a few words : No.1 - great ( in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end ) and funny ( many scenes are ridiculous ) ; No.2 - raging ( Jackie is really * beep * off here ) and painful ( Jackie gets tortured ) ; No.3 - unbelievable ( the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible ) and bombastic ( should I mention a lot of guns and explosions?).<br /><br />As to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others.<br /><br />It 's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again ( at least by me ) . Its place is in top 10 among action / comedy jewels . Finally it 's been released in Russia on DVD ( the 2nd film has the best options - the Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles).<br /><br />Solid 10 out of 10 . Thank you for attention .
1 Police story brought Hong Kong movies to modern day cinema.<br /><br />Jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys , and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend Selina ( Brigitte Lin).<br /><br />The movie features plenty of stunts , not only from Jackie , but also from other actors ( who are now in Jackies stunt club).<br /><br />Three of Jackie 's stunt members went to hospital during filming on the film.<br /><br />The movie also have some incredible fights scenes like ' ' the car park fight '' and ' ' the shoppingmal fight ranks as one of Jackie 's finest.<br /><br />The movie also won award for best movie and best action design by Jackie Chan at Hong Kong film awards.<br /><br />Everyone who loves Jackie Chan and/or martial art movies shud see this
1 Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery . Some of the stunts here are among Jackie 's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackie 's greatest single fight sequence , more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact.<br /><br />But unfortunately the rest of the film does n't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements . I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through . In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just does n't work for me . Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle.<br /><br />As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles.<br /><br />Great stunts , OK movie a fine starting point if you 've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10
1 This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here . This is still the best Action movie ever done . The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly . only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan . The stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever . The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing . The end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film . The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt .
1 This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview , Jackie said it was his favorite as well . It contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well . This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee , who used parts in Rapid Fire , and was also lifted in Tango and Cash , which used some of the opening scenes.<br /><br />Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong . The story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as Jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil Ku ( who is one of the greatest villains in any Jackie Chan movie . ) You can expect some very funny scenes as Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend , played by Maggie Chung . His job is to protect Ku 's secretary who has enough information to take him down , but even that poses many problems . Jackie is at his absolute best here . The last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - period . It was the most intense fight I have ever seen Jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights . All in all , one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands . He was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage.<br /><br />All in all , another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies . By the end of this movie , you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen . So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility himself . There are no gimmicks , wires or stand - ins - it is all true - life action that is a treat to watch . It is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now . If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general , give yourself a treat and watch this movie . It is truly sensational .
1 This is one of Jackies best films that is him without opera buddies Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with Jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy
1 Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master , Jackie Chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983 's Project A , a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re - established him as a major star . By the time Police Story was released two years later , the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its zenith , and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts , brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy . It broke numerous box - office records and inspired a 50 % rise in police recruits , but , viewed 20 years on - is it any good?<br /><br />As an action movie Police Story unquestionably stands up . There are several terrific fight scenes , some stuntwork that recalls the very best of Chan 's hero Buster Keaton , and a compelling if over - violent climactic tussle . Jackie 's performance is also very strong , and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film 's impact just a little , his charisma carries it through . Furthermore , in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger , Jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed ! By praising Police Story as a simple ' Good vs. Evil ' battle critics belittled the film 's ambiguity of tone , and whilst it 's hardly The Brothers Karamazov , in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas.<br /><br />In short , this remains a quality " popcorn " movie * ( though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film 's final scene ) - a potent , boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period .
1 This is Jackie Chan 's best film , and my personal favourite . After the disappointing U.S made ' The Protector ' directed by James Glickenhaus , Jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into Hong Kong . This is also probably Jackies most violent movie , with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts.<br /><br />The action is fast and furious , Jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design . Bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you 'll see in the credits.<br /><br />The script is a simple cops and robbers affair , nothing special , after all it was written around the action . I must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing , but it should n't put you off too much.<br /><br />So , get the lads round , crack open the beers and enjoy . By the way , the film was nicknamed ' Glass Story ' by the stunt crew . Why ? I 'll let you find out for yourself ! !
1 Jackie Chan name is synonomus to stunts . This movie never let you down . The opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder , if he knows the meaning of fear . This movie comes very close to Jackie 's best which is PROJECT A.But the main difference being that PROJECT A contains three stars where as in this movie Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders . This is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee . The film has nice comic touches too . What makes this film work is Jakie 's ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero . This movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor .
1 The best martial arts movie ever made . This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did . A classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax . Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu . It 's a great pity that whilst Bruce Lee had been so overrated , it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America . Jackie rules ! ! ! !
1 Police Story is one of Jackie Chan 's classic films that helped shape the Hong Kong cinema . It is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan . From the beginning it is obvious that Jackie Chan 's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film . Both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative . Even today , no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts . Many people were hospitalized in Police Story including Jackie Chan . The fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define Jackie Chan 's use of props . Throughout the film Chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass . The action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and Jackie Chan 's coordination is outstanding.<br /><br />The rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan . Chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation . The plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times . While the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action . However , for the time period it was made in , the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining . There a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well.<br /><br />Overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made . And even in Hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored .
1 Jackie Chan 's Police Story is a landmark film for both the Honk Kong action genre and the career of Jackie Chan.<br /><br />Directed / written by Chan , Police Story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre , and like most of the the films of Police Storys ' kind , the script is nothing to be raved about . But the plot of the film is Jackie Chan , who plays a nice guy cop , struggling to convict the local gang lord.<br /><br />The direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that Jackie Chan has given us , that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece " Miracles " . However the job that Jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable . The standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes.<br /><br />The performances in this film also vary with Jackie giving a very solid typical Chan nice guy up against it role , but this is by no means his best acting role , that can been seen in the Sammo Hung directed film " Heart of the Dragon " . The other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as Jackie with Bridgete Lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well , but neither does she display full acting potential . The standout acting comes from Maggie Cheung as Jackies ' suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief . None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film . < br /><br />The action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised , modern setting , the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera . To begin with there is a shootout in the slum where Koo ( ganglord ) is making a drug deal , whilst being no John Woo style sequence , this serves as a nice starter for the film . This is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight . This is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by Bad Boys 2 . In the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as Jackie tries to transport Bridgete Lin from her house to his . This is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films . This sequence is fantastically choreographed , timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene . However , as tradition dictates , the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film . This sequence displays some of Chans ' best choreography , stunts and camera / editing work . This sequence is now famous for two things , the amount of people sent through high density glass , which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people , and the stunt at the end where Jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony , grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof ( this has to be seen to be believed ) . Whilst the two for - mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant , i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is Chans ' ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography , that for me has never been bettered . I also believe that the action in Police Story is some of the best filmed and edited action of Chans career helping to set the action apart from others.<br /><br />Overall , Police Story , despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding , is one of the best action films of all time displaying Chans best choreography , best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone . Afterall , we watch a Chan movie for the action ! !
1 It 's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up . He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches , kicks and incredible stunts . To be fair , he 's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown . But with ' Rush Hour 3 ' , where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker ( of all people ! ) , and then there 's ' Kung Fu Panda ' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue ... to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.<br /><br />It 's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger , fitter , Chris Tucker - free days.<br /><br />Enter ' Police Story ' . Jackie Chan plays Kar - kui , a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial . He faces resistance from both the unco - operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.<br /><br />But on the other hand , who cares ? We do n't watch Jackie Chan films for the story . We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye - popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.<br /><br />And on that level , ' Police Story ' does n't disappoint at all . There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant , high - voltage chandelier . Seriously , if this sort of thing happened more often , no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.<br /><br />There is also comedy , much of which involves Kar - kui inadvertently upsetting May ( Maggie Cheung ) , his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend . The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle , but it works so I 'm not complaining.<br /><br />The acting is n't too subtle , either . Indeed , I 'm not sure there was anything subtle about ' Police Story ' at all . Director Jackie Chan ( yeah , he does that too ) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films , and knows that while we 're waiting for the next fight to start , the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.<br /><br />So ' Police Story ' is a blast . As is the case with most of his films , the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition . I mean , when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella , a whole new " Wow ! " factor is added to the action .
1 Maybe the movie itself is n't one of the best Jackie Chan 's movies , but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made . There also was some memorable stunts , which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic . This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film ( like they could remake that chase scene , I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better ) . There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie was n't fighting . Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film .
1 Well , I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan 's best film . The plot , the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent . In this film , Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui ( Kevin Chan in some versions ) who successfully arrested a crime lord . After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer . Due to this , he became wanted by the police . Later on , Salina ( Brigitte Lin ) , who was the secretary of the crime lord , went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord 's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan . However , the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her . Later on , Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen , defeating them one by one . At the last scene , Chan was seen punching the crime lord . Lastly , this is the best action and comedy movie . Everyone should watch it . Highly recommended .
1 Rated PG-13 for violence , brief sexual humor and drug content . Quebec Rating:13+(should be G ) Canadian Home Video Rating:14A < br /><br />I have seen Police Story a couple of times now . In my opinion Police Story is Chan 's best film from the 80's . He originally made it because he did n't like the other cop film he had to star in which was The Protector . I have not seen the protector so I ca nt compare . The acting is n't too bad and the plot is pretty good . I do n't remember the plot well because I saw this film a while back but what I do remember is this film has lots of great action , stunts and comedy just what a good Chan film needs . If you can find Police Story and you are Chan fan then buy this film ! < br /><br />Runtime:106min < br /><br />9/10
1 Although John Woo 's hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie . But i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie . I say this because the stunts , the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with Chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor . OUCH ! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98 . ( Or something in 14 dollars.)VHS new line home video . any questions or comments please feel free to reply . ( i 'm only 14 but i know where you can find any movie ever made . ) if you looking everywhere for a movie and ca n't find it please reply to me . Thank you and good night !
1 Jackie Chan 's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY ( 1985 ) is among the most influential and over - the - top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong . Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other " urban " action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam . POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds.<br /><br />Jackie plays Chan Ka - Kui , a police who gets to protect an important witness ( Brigitte Lin ) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity . Jackie 's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung , who is n't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio ( and the sequel ) by Johnnie To , Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others . The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.<br /><br />Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes , some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head ( near the eye ) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass . Also Jackie 's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film . The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie , spitting the kidnappers through the windshield , went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen did n't fly as they were supposed to . They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries . During the end credits , there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless , but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely.<br /><br />The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by ( action ) director Chan . The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver . Jackie always tells how important editing is ( which is true ) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts , for instance . There 's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch.<br /><br />But there is again one negative point which I can not stand in HK action comedies , which is this comedy itself . The comedy is n't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay are n't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there , without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue . I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare , and he is there to " murder " that girl . This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I would n't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre . Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those " loud thoughts " are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and " light . " Even if the film is comic and not so serious , these kind of stupidities should not be there and they can not be forgiven too easily.<br /><br />POLICE STORY is a fast speed , full impact , balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he did n't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result did n't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film . That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80 's . This is among the most insane action films ever , and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned . 7/10
1 This movie is Jackie 's best . I still ca nt get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever . I also like the bad guys in this movie ( the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard ) . Unlike some of Jackie 's other work , this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of Jackie 's fans .
1 I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies , but this is for sure the best one I have seen so far.<br /><br />The story in it self is nothing special really , so I won´t go deeper into that . What makes it special is the stunts , the fighting , the good acting , the warm sense of humor . The movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it . All the cool stunts ( of course made by Jackie himself)makes you want jump around in the couch and scream . It´s just awesome ! Even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it.<br /><br />I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to get a hold of , at least it is here in Sweden . But I can assure you , it´s worth a try .
1 I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles . I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over - acting . This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score , which really irked me throughout the entire movie . If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes . Then the film would be much , much better .
1 I do find it a bit overrated . Maybe it 's just because I 've never seen a subtitled version ( dubbing stinks ! ) , but I just do n't get into it like a lot of other people do . The finale is really great though as Jackie trashes a mall , a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping !
1 A French novelist , disgusted by his wife 's society friends , goes to North Africa for a respite . There he encounters a vivacious & talented Bedouin girl , living in poverty . To spite his wife , who is romancing a Maharajah , he decides to train & educate the girl , and present her to Parisian society as the PRINCESSE TAM TAM ... <br /><br />The marvelous Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable French film . With her enormous eyes & infectious smile , she makes contact with the viewer 's heartstrings immediately . Her over - sized personality & obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch . Baker makes us care about what 's happening to poor Alwina during her transformation & introduction to European mores.<br /><br />Albert Préjean does very well as the Pygmalion to Baker 's Galatea ; also effective are Georges Peclet as a half - caste servant , and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah.<br /><br />The film is very handsome & well made , looking a little reminiscent of Busby Berkeley movies being produced at the same time in America - although unlike American films of this period , PRINCESSE TAM TAM has n't any racism . It should be pointed out that there was no Hays Office or Production Code in France . Some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative , but it must be admitted that Baker singing & dancing to ' Under The African Sky , ' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub , are two of the cinema 's more memorable moments.<br /><br />Actual location filming in Tunisia greatly enhances the film.<br /><br />Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906 , into a very poor family . Her talent & driving ambition , however , soon pushed her into moving East and she was briefly a cast member of the Ziegfeld Follies . Realizing that America in the mid-1920 's held great limitations for a gifted Black woman , she managed to get herself to Paris , where she eventually joined the Foliés - Bergeres & Le Negre Revue . The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity . A short return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African - Americans . She returned to France , became a French citizen & worked for the Resistance during the early days of the War . Baker relocated to Morocco for the duration and entertained Allied troops stationed there.<br /><br />After the War , Baker 's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial & personal difficulties . For a while , she was even banned from returning to the United States . Finally , Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality . Josephine Baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975 , at the age of 68.<br /><br />Having appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure . But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier , Dietrich & Robeson , as one of her generation 's truly legendary performers .
1 Princess Tam Tam is without the trappings of racism , in the way we think of racism in the United States , but there are more subtle ( to the American viewer ) assertions about ethnic identity during the time . Pay attention to Alwina 's ( Baker ) placement within shots , how she is addressed by the other characters , the settings around her that all depict her as a " savage " African , and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . I do n't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention , the dichotomy between " Eastern " and " Western " culture is to say the least offensive , such diction is thankfully disavowed these days . The French have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted ( see Chris Marker 's Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953 ) , and pay attention to the places the European travelers visit while they are in Africa , and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the " other " . I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker , much of what she did in her professional career , like Princes Tam Tam , that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration , her work as a freaking spy ( I am gushing , sorry . ) However the film for me is captivating because of her performance , besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities .
1 I think that this movie was reasonbaly good . It 's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all . I enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on Full House . Anyway , the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny . I kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names . It 's just kind of an older version of It Takes Two .
1 I , as a teenager really enjoyed this movie ! Mary Kate and Ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease . I thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to ! Be sure and rent it ! ! Also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players ! :)
1 This movie is so good I could watch it all day long ! Mary - Kate and Ashley were robbed at Oscar time ! ! If I got to be one of the actors I would be so excited ! ! ! I ca n't wait for the new Charlie 's Angels movie starring Mary - Kate and Ashley .
1 I thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of Mary - Kate 's and Ashley 's characters Sam and Emma Stanton ! They are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but ; unfortunately , it 's just not that easy for them to actually do ! I thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then I 'm sure that you 'll agree with me here ! If you have n't seen this movie yet then I say you really missed - out ; big time , and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now ! This movie is a real winner ! Sincerely , Rick Morris
1 I 'm a HUGE fan of the twin sisters . Although this was one of their " not soo good " movies . I 'm not saying it 's bad , I ca n't say it 's bad , but this whole popular and not popular thingy is n't good . Although I give this movie a 4 .
1 Let me state at the outset that I have Cerebral Palsy and I went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance . I left the theater half - convinced that they 'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role , even though I knew that was not the case . The performances were generally excellent , with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner ( I believe that 's his name ) as the young Christy Brown . Christy is talented , brash , arrogant , at times vulgar and petulant - in other words , human . This film , along with Gaby : A True Story and the documentary King Gimp , are excellent portrayals of life with CP . By no means a complete portrait , but fine examples of the disabled as human beings . Most highly recommended .
1 Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites . It is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them real.<br /><br />I remember , many years ago , we had a party in our house - the friends came over , we were sitting around the table , eating , drinking the wine , talking , laughing - having a good time . The TV was on - there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to . Then , suddenly , all of us stopped talking and laughing . The glasses did not clink , the forks did not move , the food was getting cold on the plates . We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot , picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor . When he finished writing that one word , we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit , the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film , and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character.<br /><br />Jim Sheridan 's " My Left Foot " is an riveting , unsentimental bio - drama about Christy Brown , the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum ; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life.<br /><br />I like every one of Day Lewis 's performances ( I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY ) but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in " My Left Foot "
1 As someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years , I find this movie to be inspirational . If someone with such a severe case of CP as Christie Brown has can do so much , then there 's no reason that I could n't achieve my own dreams . Daniel Day - Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give awesome performances.<br /><br / >
1 The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day - Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown , guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds . As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy , I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing . The enormous support that Christy got form his family , low - income , working class Dubliners , encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book , but the dialogs were written wisely to capture Christy Brown 's witty arrogant personality . I do recommend this movie to everyone , especially to classic movie - lovers .
1 Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland , you have to love " My Left Foot " ( and especially Daniel Day - Lewis ' performance in it ) . He plays cerebral palsy - afflicted Christy Brown . Due to this , he has spent most of his life ostracized . Even when trying to warn people about something , they just laugh at him . The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part : his left foot . He uses that appendage to paint and write poetry , bringing him to prominence.<br /><br />Daniel Day - Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration , and also on a later collaboration : " In the Name of the Father " ( but " The Boxer " was unnecessary ) . " My Left Foot " can make you feel many ways : sad , hopeful , or something else . But in any case , Daniel Day - Lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here . A great movie in every sense .
1 DANIEL DAY - LEWIS does a remarkable job of playing Christy Brown , the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life , dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer.<br /><br />The film , however , is a very difficult one to review -- or even watch . Fortunately , I had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if I saw the film in a theater . While I respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter , I ca n't say it 's the sort of film I 'd want to view more than once.<br /><br />Nevertheless , my attention was held by the story - telling device , a flashback framed by the present , in which we see Christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him , who certainly gave him loving care.<br /><br />DANIEL DAY - LEWIS certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist ( FIONA SHAW ) , much to his mother 's fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken . There 's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much.<br /><br />BRENDA FRICKER does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him , his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until Day - Lewis begins to have success with his work . She complements Day - Lewis ' performance as the warm - hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him.<br /><br />Richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film . Both Fricker and Day - Lewis won Oscars , but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent . O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy.<br /><br />Summing up : Elmer Bernstein 's music is an added plus factor . Well worthwhile , but definitely not a film for everyone .
1 Seriously , can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget : Daniel Day - Lewis , Ray McAnally , Brenda Fricker , Hugh O'Conor AND Fiona Shaw ? There 's no doubting that Fricker and Day - Lewis deserved their awards : but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O'Conor ( as Young Christie ) and McAnally awarded : the cliché is true here : they do n't perform the roles , they inhabit them . Day - Lewis ' performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe - inducing , but it was truly a mark of the Academy 's intelligence that alongside this performance , they also honoured Brenda Fricker 's beautifully restrained , still and heart - wrenching work as Christie 's mother . By the way , if you have n't seen this magnificent actress in " Swann " , that 's another film well worth checking out for her contribution ( and the sublime Miranda Richardson ) .
1 My left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown , who had cerebral palsy , a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot , but he was defiant , he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds < br /><br />I have seen this film a lot of times and each time I see it , I find it equally brilliant each time . I wonder how did this amazing film not win an Oscer for best picture , It is a shambles by the academy awards . Jim Shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world.the screenplay , the music and anything else is excellent in this film . As the film goes on , you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs . Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally brilliant as d.r Eileen Cole , who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />The Irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot . My left foot was the start of a wonderful period in Irish film . films so powerful and brilliant such as the field , the crying game , in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscers and won some , A wonderful period for Irish film . My left foot is a powerful outstanding film.<br /><br />Daniel day - lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy . To me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances , especially Daniel day - Lewis 's performance which I would regard as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs . Daniel day - lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor.<br /><br />this is an excellent masterpiece in film , see it !
1 Daniel Day - Lewis is Christy Brown , a victim of cerebral palsy who uses " My Left Foot " to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film . The movie also stars Brenda Fricker as Christy 's mother , Ray McAnally , Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor . Their brilliant performances , great script and wonderful direction by Jim Sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of Christy Brown , an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49.<br /><br />Brown was born into a lower middle - class Catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant ( 22 children in total , 13 of whom survived ) . His father considered Christy mentally retarded as well as physically handicapped , but he would not permit his son to go into a home . The children in the family would bid goodbye to him each day as they went off to school , and then his mother would feed him and talk to him.<br /><br />In the movie , Fricker conveys the sense of a woman who , despite being surrounded by a huge family , needs someone to talk to . Christy does n't talk back . Eventually a cart is found for him to ride in , and the neighborhood kids , all of whom have known him since he was a baby , include him in all of their activities . The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot , and when the kids find out how well he kicks , they put him into soccer games for just that purpose . One of the nicest parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat him.<br /><br />There are many powerful scenes , but none as powerful as Christy writing " Mother " on the floor holding a piece of chalk between his toes . " He 's a true Brown , " his father declares , hoisting him on his shoulders and carrying him to the pub . Walking into the pub , he announces , " My son 's a genius . " Things change when Christy grows older because he has a young boy 's desires and emotions . He develops crushes , is rejected and goes more into himself , turning to painting . Eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist , Eileen ( Fiona Shaw ) at home . He falls in love with her . When he finds out she 's engaged , he nearly goes crazy . But he survives to live , to paint , to write ( three books in total ) and to love again.<br /><br />Because it 's a film , by necessity certain things had to be left out and characters combined . Brown was n't actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time , which was left out of the movie . The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in Christy 's life , and though we know that his mother believed he had a good mind , in truth , she worked very hard with Christy when he was a child teaching him the alphabet , etc . Also , before Mary , Christy had a 12-year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated " My Left Foot . " And the typical Hollywood ending , 9 years before his death where neglect by his wife may have been a factor , does n't finish the story.<br /><br />Despite all of that , Christy Brown 's biopic is incredibly powerful , all the more so because of two performances : Hugh O'Conor as young Christy and Daniel Day - Lewis as the adult Christy . O'Conor 's facial expression and the way he drags his warped body is gut - wrenching . One is exhausted for him and heartbroken at the same time.<br /><br />And what can be said about Daniel Day - Lewis , one of the greatest actors in the world - he brings Christy totally to life , a fully fleshed out , intelligent human being capable of swearing , becoming angry , bitter , drunk , pushy , lecherous , funny and loving . A well - deserved Oscar won in the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for " Born on the Fourth of July . " I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruise was so sensational , what was wrong with the Academy ? Uh , nothing for a change . Nothing at all.<br /><br />Brenda Fricker is amazing as Christy 's mother , who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds her family and husband together during the hard times . The wonderful thing about Fricker 's performance is that the support , love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother . The character would never consider herself a heroine or as someone doing something out of the ordinary . Fricker shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother . And no matter what , even when her husband is out of work , throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant , whatever , she manages . She saves money for Christy 's wheelchair , she receives photos of her daughter and the baby , she starts building a room for Christy in the back of the house . All part of a day 's work . A performance worthy of the Oscar she received.<br /><br />Brown 's life was more complicated than this inspiring film , but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a must - see .
1 A noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of Oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped . The first was Marlee Matlin 's award for " Children of a Lesser God " in 1986 , and the next ten years were to see another " Best Actress " award ( Holly Hunter for " The Piano " in 1994 ) and no fewer than five " Best Actor " awards ( Dustin Hoffman in 1988 for " Rain Man " , Daniel Day - Lewis in 1989 for " My Left Foot " , Al Pacino in 1992 for " Scent of a Woman " , Tom Hanks in 1994 for " Forrest Gump " and Geoffrey Rush in 1996 for " Shine " ) for portrayals of the disabled . Matlin , who played a deaf woman , is herself deaf , but all the others are able - bodied . < br /><br />This phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time , with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting . When Jodie Foster failed to win " Best Actress " for " Nell " in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal . My view , however , is that the majority of these awards were well deserved . I thought the 1992 award should have gone to either Clint Eastwood or Robert Downey rather than Pacino , but apart from that the only one with which I disagreed would have been Hanks ' , and that was because I preferred Nigel Hawthorne 's performance in " The Madness of King George " . In that film , of course , Hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill . < br /><br />"My Left Foot " was based upon the autobiography of the Irish writer and painter Christy Brown . Brown was born in 1931 , one of the thirteen children of a working - class Dublin family . He was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well . He was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech , but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body , his left foot ( hence the title ) . He learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes , and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet . < br /><br />Life in working - class Dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard , and the city Jim Sheridan ( himself a Dubliner ) shows us here is in many ways a grim , grey , cheerless place , very different from our normal idea of the " Emerald Isle " . ( Sheridan and Day - Lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an Irish theme , " In the Name of the Father " ) . Against this , however , must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people , especially the Brown family . Much of Christy 's success was due to the support he received from his parents , who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior , and from his siblings . We see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially - made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build Christy a room of his own in their back yard . < br /><br />The film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart - warming " triumph over adversity " movie . That it does not is due to a number of factors , principally the magnificent acting . In the course of his career , Day - Lewis has given a number of fine performances , but this , together with the recent " There Will Be Blood " , is his best . He is never less than 100 % convincing as Christie ; his tortured , jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person , even though , intellectually , we are well aware that Day - Lewis is able - bodied . The other performances which stand out are from Fiona Shaw as his mentor Dr Eileen Cole , from Hugh O'Conor as the young Christy and from Brenda Fricker as Christy 's mother ( which won her the " Best Supporting Actress " award ) . < br /><br />The other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character . Christy Brown had a difficult life , but he could also be difficult to live with , and the film gives us a " warts and all " portrait . He was a heavy drinker , given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage . He could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him , and the film shows us all these aspects of his character . Of course , it also shows us the positive aspects- his courage , his determination and his wicked sense of humour . Day - Lewis 's acting is not just physically convincing , in that it persuades us to believe in his character 's disability , but also emotionally and intellectually convincing , in that it brings out all these different facets of Christy 's character . His Oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of Robin Williams and Kenneth Branagh , but it was well deserved . 8/10
1 If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone , disabled or not , to persevere despite the odds and make it ( even when " make it " as an expression , proper , can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth ) , MY LEFT FOOT is it . It 's a hard film to watch at times : seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown 's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction , and at a dinner table when the woman who 's reached out to him , made him able to communicate effectively , now has announced at a key moment ( the inauguration of Brown 's art ) she is about to marry another man -- is tough . Very , very tough . More so because this is a man who can not react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how : via screams , shrieks , and profanities aimed at hurting himself . However , this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account , but that of a man overcoming his severe disability , becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world . Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful , unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious Christy Brown , and Brenda Fricker did so as well for her supporting role as Brown 's solid mother .
1 Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story , and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart - stirring . Daniel Day - Lewis is a chameleon , really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character . Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience.<br /><br />The movie is not so pessimistic as I thought before , the story is kinda bright and intriguing . Christy is not despised by the normals , his life is also colorful and delightful , although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes.<br /><br />One important factor of Christy 's success is his mother 's support which seems to be more touching , and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role , this fat little middle - aged woman uses her all to make Christy 's dream come true . So lucky for Christy!And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as young Christy , what a performance for a child ! The love story of Christy is very well - done , trustful . Christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love , his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole ( surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw , I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series , the loathsome Aunt Petunia , so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind , but anyway , any woman has her own youth ... ) is paranoiac and offensive , I do have sympathy for him , love is a two - edged sword , happiness and agony are just next to each other.<br /><br />Btw , Jim Sheridan 's works are all good ( IN America , THE BOXER etc . ) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying ' , god knows why he chose to direct that crap ! Really a career taint for him , what a pity !
1 Saw this film on DVD yesterday and was gob - smacked and flabbergasted . The unaffected acting of DDL just blew my mind , and I was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting . All of the character were so authentic to me , I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mom . Go and see it ! You 'll cry your heart out , but you 'll experience a wonderful catharsis ! Besides , it teaches you one important lesson : Determination is everything . You may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin , but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all . If you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer . The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self - pity . It wo n't get you anywhere and the only person who 'll pity you will be yourself .
1 I have seen this film three times now , and each time I see it , it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch.<br /><br />The acting is amazing , which is not hard to believe since it is Daniel Day Lewis , who is an amazing actor . Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder in it , though . She captures your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy , who is not able to walk , or speak until he is in his late teens.<br /><br />I ca n't say enough good things about the movie , but I will stop here . I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events , or just enjoy good dramas in general .
1 I 've just returned from a showing of " My Left Foot " at our public library . What an emotional experience -- I feel drained and uplifted.<br /><br />It 's the story of Christy Brown , Irish writer and painter , and based on the author 's autobiographical " My Left Foot . " Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot . Doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother did n't give up on him and , somewhat as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller , helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read , write , and paint.<br /><br />This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day - Lewis ( best actor ) as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother ; it also received Oscar nominations for best picture , best director , and best adapted screenplay.<br /><br />As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist , while many films may entertain me , many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions.<br /><br />Not this film -- it was absolutely " spot on " in portraying typical Irish parental roles & behaviors ( see , e.g. , see typical Irish families in McGoldrick 's " Ethnicity & Family Therapy " ) as well Christy Brown 's uneven emotional maturation -- some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father.<br /><br />The film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development ( painting & writing ) and condensing several important people into one person , for the sake of telling a coherent , believable story , not burdened by small , distracting , less important actualities . ( See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy . ) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy 's speech ( & some of the Irish speech ) ; the initial release of the film may have lacked this . ( If you see this on DVD , enable that option.)<br /><br />The performance by Daniel Day - Lewis is one of the greatest , believable acting jobs I 've ever seen . Truly magnificent , outstanding , superlative.<br /><br />"My Left Foot " bears more than some similarity to a more recent film , " The Diving Bell & the Butterfly , " in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap.<br /><br />And in doing so , it resonates with William Ernest Henley 's " Invictus " which begins : " Out of the night that covers me,//Black as the Pit from pole to pole,//I thank whatever gods may be//For my unconquerable soul . "
1 My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy . in her 22 years of life , she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids . i have been the butt of everyone 's jokes because my sister is disabled , and i still think to this day that nobody is , or ever will give a damn about her and her condition . Then i saw this film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy 's family was going through . but they were lucky . Christy could talk , he could communicate , and he had artistic skills . my sister can walk , but she ca n't utter a word , and she ca n't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things . but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister , and the ending ( to tell the truth ) made me cry . AND I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK ! ! ! This film is seriously underrated , and it should n't . This movie tells people something . that people should be proud of their own lives . thinking you ca n't write well ? this guy wrote with his foot . thinking you 're not attractive ? this guy got turned down by lots of girls , because of his condition . not the fastest runner ? christy could n't even stand up.<br /><br />My point : Parents of young children , i suggest your children watch this movie with you , so they 'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair , they do n't stare at them like they 're aliens . My sister got millions of stares , and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people . This film will teach people , that people who might not seem " normal " are people too . 10/10
1 MY LEFT FOOT , in my opinion , is a great biopic about one of the world 's most talented authors and painters . The performances were smashing , the soundtrack was great , and the casting was perfect . I thought that Christy ( Daniel Day - Lewis ) was a very talented man , although I could n't understand what he was saying most of the time . In addition , when he threw a tantrum , I got a little scared . Also , it 's just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy . In conclusion , if you are a die - hard fan of Daniel Day - Lewis or like biopics , I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world 's most talented authors and painters . You 're in for a real treat and a good time , so do n't miss this one .
1 I thought Hugh O'Conor was astounding as the young Christy Brown , and really deserved greater recognition for his role . I could n't believe how well he played the part . Of course , Daniel Day - Lewis was brilliant too . My favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and Christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty ! Amazing performances by the two Christys ( and other also ) .
1 I watched this film in shire joy.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the best films of all time . It has a timeless value , you can get so much out of it it 's amazing . There are parts that are moving , funny , and just great.<br /><br />All aspect are spot on , the portrayal of the story is perfect , every detail is 100 % genuine , even small Irish subtleties have been covered.<br /><br />The use of low and high shots gives two great views on Cristy ( look out for that).<br /><br />Daniel Day - Lewis 's performance is incredible . I 've never seen an actor do that , ever . It really is amazing.<br /><br />And it 's so great to watch , it flows so well , it 's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience . I love it.<br /><br />If you have n't seen it , you should see it . Do n't have any doubts on it , there is something there for all .
1 Based on Christy Brown 's autobiographical novel , this endearing film tells the story of his life , him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother . Amazingly , he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot , which is the only part of him he can control . An amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis . 9 of 10
1 There are n't many overcoming - the - odds stories quite like that of Christy Brown . Born with cerebral palsy in 1930s Dublin , his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical . Though eventually properly diagnosed , Brown , in a lower working - class family with nearly 20 children , had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family . Through the use of his only fully - functioning limb , his left leg , he taught himself to write and paint , both skills he developed expertly . < br /><br />But what makes the film version of Brown 's autobiography " My Left Foot " such a great retelling is its humility . Both director / writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day - Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that does n't scream for attention and resort to melodrama . Cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous , yet " My Left Foot " stays real and intrinsically inspired.<br /><br />Day - Lewis is the easiest to highlight . Playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task . Not only does Day - Lewis give us a very complete picture of Christy , but he also manages to chronicle the growth , improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life . He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned Christy who struggles to cope with why he ca n't find non - platonic love . The latter theme is the film 's strongest and it would 've been nice for Sheridan and co - adapter Shane Connaughton to really flesh that out . Regardless , Day - Lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements , giving a performance that 's so believable you often do n't have time to think " wow , he 's such a great actor . " Those are the most commendable performances.<br /><br />Equally important but through more subtle means is Sheridan 's work on the film . This story is about day - to - day life and struggles . Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life , his struggles are not unlike our own and Sheridan grasps that concept completely . Christy struggles with love , parental attention , questions of self- worth and capability . His struggles are just more physically manifested ( literally and figuratively ) than ours . < br /><br />Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large Brown family and Christy 's unique place in it . The drama evolves naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way . The dinner scene when Christy learns that his doctor / teacher -- the woman he loves -- is going to marry his brother Peter is the film 's finest example of both Day - Lewis and Sheridan 's efforts . It 's built up to so well by Sheridan that it comes out when we 're ready and Day - Lewis takes us from there with his stunning work.<br /><br />The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown . I did not know she 'd won the Oscar , but there was something about her performances as Christy 's loving and wise mother that just screamed Oscar - worthy . Her love for Christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situation.<br /><br />The emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal . Perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human . The two should be reconcilable , but I imagine it 's challenging to tell a story that feels true - to - life and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster . The choice to downplay the latter was definitely the wise one for " My Left Foot . " Brown 's circumstances speak for themselves -- they do n't need to be squeezed for weightier dramatic impact.<br /><br />~Steven C < br /><br />Visit my site moviemusereviews.com for more
1 As far as I know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal , I 'd agree with him . This is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy / man with a special body part helping him . Oscar and BAFTA winning , and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day - Lewis plays Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor , in a wheelchair and carried by his family . He has a special left foot though , he can write with it , paint with it and hold things with it . He learns to speak later in the film , it is very good for a guy like him . Also starring Home Alone 2 's Oscar winning , and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan , Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture , it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film , Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay . Daniel Day - Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he was number 9 on Britain 's Finest Actors , and he was number 15 on The World 's Greatest Actor , and the film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films . Outstanding !
1 Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor . He is brilliant as Christy Brown , a man who has cerebral palsy , who then learned to write and paint with his left foot . A well deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays his loving mother . Hugh O'Conner is terrific as the younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally is great as the father . Worth watching for the outstanding performances .
1 I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel Day - Lewis play Christy Brown in My Left Foot . In fact off the scene his role was n't even over . He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back . To me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role I believe it is quite true to say he put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history . He was so masterful in this tough a part that I believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him . Although I can not say it is the greatest movie of all time I can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it was n't even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet I will ever seen an actor do . Probably a man too for that matter .
1 Daniel Day - Lewis is the most versatile actor alive . English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View , passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father , an impudent , violent butcher in Gangs of New York ( in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody 's in the Pianist ) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot ( just to name a few ) . His roles all influence eachother , but each is seperate , and utterly unique . He changes completely , with each character he takes on . And I 'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything . Anything.<br /><br />As Cristy Brown he is stunning . He does not ridicule the character , and he does not pity the character . A difficult achievement . And Cristy Brown comes to life . A smart man . An outrageous man . Human.<br /><br />This movie , despite small scene - transition faults and the like , is an inspiration . Yes , it 's predictable . But is it stupidly sentimental ? No . I laughed . I cried . Not a single moment of cheese . Proof that this is n't a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant , when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen , Peter and her friends . Here 's where Daniel Day - Lewis reaches an acting climax . " I 'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that 's animated . " " Wheel out the cripple ! " And his performance never slows down , never falters , and is beautiful . Simply . He has a lot of screen time here . I watch it again again , and I never get tired of Cristy 's perspicacious eyes , twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must - see . Fo sho , yo !
1 " My Left Foot " is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown , an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot , the only limb in his body he had control over . Daniel Day - Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this film , which I 'm not absolutely certain was deserved , but is still noteworthy . Day - Lewis give Brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch . Brenda Fricker , as Brown 's devoted mother , also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role . My problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times . When Brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot , the film can be difficult to watch . This gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time . However , if you look beyond that , you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome . Those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film , because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties , we can certainly do the same thing . Well made , occasionally enjoyable , but difficult to watch . May not be for everyone , but not bad at all.<br /><br / > * * * out of * * * *
1 At the time , " My Left Foot " was the little movie that could . It was hugely popular , and everyone applauded the fact that such a small , independent film could make it all the way to the Oscars.<br /><br />Since then , movies like " My Left Foot " are a dime a dozen , so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about . It 's certainly a well made and competent film , but it 's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day - Lewis , who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown , a man living with cerebral palsy . Day - Lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won Dustin Hoffman an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in " Rain Man , " and the Academy followed suit by giving Day - Lewis the same honor.<br /><br />The only thing really separating this film from a big budget Hollywood production is just that -- its budget . In every other way it 's just as formulaic as any standard product . That 's not to say it is n't a good movie , but it 's not a masterpiece.<br /><br />Grade : A-
1 This could be a 10 if it was n't for the quite predictable and hollywood - ish scenario . Daniel Day - Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time ( why not THE leading may I ask ) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level . I personally was impressed with Hugh O ' Connor who played Christy Brown as a child . The very first scene I watched him was really strong . Wow .
1 This movie will go down down in history as one of the greats , right along side of Citizen Kane , Casablanca , and On The Waterfront . Someone please convince Leno to do a sequel ! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo , the likes of which have n't been seen since Abbot and Costello . The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon , Tom Noonan , and Randall " Tex " Cobb will give you the chills . Dingman 's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of Shakespeare 's comedies . And the climax . My goodness , the climax . I wo n't ruin it for you , but it makes the explosion of the Death Star pale in comparison . If you can track down this hard - to - find gem , do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately . I 'm still holding out hope for a special edition DVD one of these days .
1 I saw this movie recently . 2 hours later , my head still hurt from laughing . The plot was soo awful , the jokes were soo bad , but what I did n't count on were:<br /><br />1 . the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had Pat and Jay posing ( that caused more than enough laughter)<br /><br />2 . The kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil - doer.<br /><br />This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series , and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you did n't like the movie , send certificate to HBO . While I considered it , the date you had to send it in was January 1991 ( which also caused wackiness to ensue ) .
1 Okay , I know I should n't like this movie but I do . From Pat Morita 's loveable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno 's annoying yell , I laughed throughout this movie . As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world , it 's a good mvie.<br /><br />My favorite part is Morita talking to his boss in Tokyo with the drinking a close second .
1 Well no , I tell a lie , this is in fact not the best movie of all time , but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody I know has seen.<br /><br />It 's a buddy cop movie starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita(Mr Miyagi ) with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something , but that does n't matter . the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads , who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends . The whole culture difference thing is done quite well , in that it 's fun to watch , it 's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way . The soundtrack is cool , once again in a cheesy 80 's kind of way , it suits the movie , I 've been trying to find one of the songs for ages , but as I 'm working from memory of what I think a few of the words were i ca n't seem to find it.<br /><br />Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever , but I wo n't give that one away , oh no ! In conclusion I 'd take this movie over 48 Hours\most of Eddie Murphys output including Beverly Hills cop , and whatever buddy junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have to their names . If you 're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with " straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop " give this a shot . You might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with " straight Japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop".<br /><br />I'm giving this 7 . to be honest I like it more than that . I 'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff I 'd give 8 . But I guess I know deep down that it 's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie .
1 Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit , this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedic duo . ' Noriyuki Pat Morita ' is a very funny man , who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief , who has stolen a ' proto type ' turbo super charger , reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief , after being ordered by his commander . Pat 's character collides with ' Jay Leno 's ' character , a fast talking ' but down to business - player type Detroit cop . When they cross paths though , the honorable ' Ways ' of Japan meet the all - out old school Detroit police investigative ' Ways ' . The two stumble and trip over each other at first , but then develop a ' rythym ' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team , that solves the case , cold . After battling a city crime boss for the stolen ' equiptment ' and closing the case , these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together . A little worse for wear and in need of an extended - vacation on top of it all , they manage to come to a victorious closing . I rated this a 9 . Lewis 's direction makes ' this a near perfect comedy . Fun for all ages . I recommend it highly . ( * * * )
1 i saw this movie on cable , it was really funny , from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys , jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part . I compare this movie to " RUSH HOUR " in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case . The chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories . Enjoyable soundtrack , good script , i give it 10/10 .
1 This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop , Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor . A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd . Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype . An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men . But Madras(played by Chris Sarandon ) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership . Meanwhile in the same junk yard where the Japanese man had been killed , a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men . Tony 's friend had been watching the junk yard.<br /><br />Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior 's order . Tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case . While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him . Eventually they end up working together on the case . They make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head . But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie , at least in my opinion . Jay Leno is no actor , but he is likable in the role and Pat Morita is good as well . Still , they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film . If you liked buddy cop films , cheesy 80 's movies or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie .
1 The acting is pretty cheesy , but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now Detroit area automotive engineers , this is a great movie . I even work with a Japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny.<br /><br />Jay Leno was showing his age last night on The Tonight Show ! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago . The opening scene , with the drag race on what appears to be Woodward Ave was great.<br /><br />Leno also owns some bad a * * cars now , it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection . I 'm sure the blown Vette in the opening scene was his own car.<br /><br />Typical 80s movie . Watch it and enjoy . No computer generated crap !
1 I did n't even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin 's review and 1 1/2 star rating . I watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than I expected . I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system . You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all . If you do n't know much about religion , you will miss a lot . I graduated from high school the year the movie was made , so maybe I can relate to it better . Yes , there is some pretension in the movie and it 's weird to some extent , but that was the 70s so what do you expect . I can see why people might not like the movie ; however , I can not understand people saying it is boring . The movie is anything but boring . You will either hate it or love it . If you find it boring , you are probably brain dead .
1 I saw the film for the first time at BBC on July the 27 of 2005 . For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle , and I truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it . I also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned . You may ask yourself was A.C. Doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question . However he was the creator of the famous Holmes , but how much of it was a sort of semi - biography ? Not the less I strongly put this adaption forward , it is a movie you have to see - even if you are n't interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look a it , enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it .
1 Written by the writer who penned the excellent Murder Rooms series which chronicled ACD 's adventures with Doctor Joseph Bell , I was looking forward to this and I was n't disappointed . It was quite slow moving , with a lot of emphasis on Doyle 's frustration at Sherlock Holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed . It was an interesting character study and very well shot ( on digital video , unusual for a period piece ) . The acting was excellent all round , particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox although the actor who portrayed ACD , whose name I can not remember impressed me no end . An excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes case . Do see this if you get the chance
1 The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring . It focused on the personal problems Doyle had , including his sick wife , death threats by fans , a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father . Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle 's life , I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes . The last 40 minutes were excellent . We finally got a look inside Doyle head , how he created Holmes and why he had to ' kill ' Holmes . The actors are excellent . Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny , Arthur Conan Doyle , a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the ' role model ' for Sherlock Holmes , Dr. Bell . The locations are good , especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice . If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece .
1 Loosely intended as a satire of D.W. Griffith 's Intolerance , The Three Ages was Buster Keaton 's first attempt at a full length comedy feature . The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening " book " scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film . Keaton 's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it did n't succeed as a feature film , it could be reduced to three two - reelers . Fortunately , The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I 've seen in any of Keaton 's film . There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines . They are simple boy - meets - girl , boy - loses - girl , boy - gets - girl plots , but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all films of this genre . However , I do n't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy . No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best . In addition , Wallace Beery 's appearance as Keaton 's rival adds to this film 's appeal . Anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920 's can not be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie .
1 First time of seeing Buster Keaton 's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and only wish I 'd stumbled across it years ago . The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion , and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated . So , it 's rocky viewing in places , but I 've seen and survived much worse.<br /><br />It would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on Intolerance it 's inventive and funny from the start to the finish : In the Stone Age with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus ; In the Roman Age Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging , No Parking signs in Latin ; In this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump . Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages , a never ending tussle . Favourite bit : As the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two!<br /><br />Great stuff , reaffirming my love of silent film comedy .
1 This was Keaton 's first feature and is in actuality three shorts , set in different periods ( Stone Age , Roman Age , Modern Age ) on the eternal triangle of romance . The stories parallel each other as in Griffith 's INTOLERANCE , which this was intended to satirize . The strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms , bringing modern day business into ancient settings.<br /><br / > * * * * WARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOW TO ELABORATE BEST POINTS * * * * * * < br /><br />Here are the classic moments:<br /><br />Using a turtle as a wee - gee board ( Stone Age ) ; A wrist watch containing a sun dial ( Roman Age ) ; A chariot with a spare wheel ( Roman Age ) ; Using a helmet as a tire lock ( Roman Age ) ; Early golf with clubs and rocks(Stone Age ) ; Dictating a will being carved into a rock ( Stone Age ) ; The changing weather forecaster ( Roman Age ) ; The chariot race in snow -Buster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the chariot 's boot(Roman Age).<br /><br />The above are all throw - away gags that keep us chuckling . There are however unforgettable moments as well:<br /><br />Buster taking out shaving equipment to match girl putting on make - up ; The fantastic double take when an inebriated Buster gazes at his plate to discover a crab staring up at him ( within one second he has leaped to stand on his chair from a sitting position and leaped again into the arms of the waiter - one of the funniest moments I 've ever seen ) . And that lion - the manicure -just brilliant.<br /><br />There 's also an off - color bit of racism when four African - American litter bearers abandon their mistress for a Roman crap game.<br /><br />Kino 's print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate deterioration and film damage- most probably at ends of reels . The Metro feature is scored with piano and flute and borrows heavily from Grieg.<br /><br />Lots of fun and full of laughs .
1 This is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages . The film consists of Keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age , in ancient Rome and in the present ( 1920s ) . In all three cases , he is the usual wimpy Buster and he battles against Wallace Beery for his lady love . Of the three time periods , I think I liked the Roman one best even though I admit it might have also been the cheesiest . I actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snow -- but what I really enjoyed the most was seeing all of Keaton 's amazing acrobatics . However , all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film , while not his best , is still an exceptional and enjoyable film . Check it out !
1 D.W. Griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of ' The Birth of a Nation ' ; he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date , ' Intolerance . ' He took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form , and the well - known financial train wreck resulted . Buster Keaton does n't take that kind of a risk with ' Three Ages , ' a parody of ' Intolerance . ' This is Keaton 's first feature - length film of his own ( he only acted in ' The Saphead ' ) . He had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts , which Griffith did do with ' Intolerance . ' Keaton did n't have to . Chaplin had already succeeded with feature - length comedies , so if Keaton was taking a risk here , it was completely calculated.<br /><br />Chaplin had already done a parody of another film , too , with ' Burlesque on Carmen ' ( 1915 ) . Keaton appears to allude to that film , as well . The wrestling scene in the Ancient Rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in Chaplin 's film . The comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same , too . Furthermore , Chaplin 's film imitated the glossy style of DeMille 's ' Carmen , ' and Chaplin 's film seemed a tribute to that film . Keaton does n't attempt the radical editing , narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody , but it seems respectful of ' Intolerance ' nonetheless . At least , the stories are n't told completely straightforward as in other post-'Intolerance ' films , such as Dreyer 's ' Leaves from Satan 's Book ' ( Blade af Satans bog , 1921 ) and Fritz Lang 's ' Destiny ' ( Der Müde Tod , 1921 ) . There is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes.<br /><br />Where Keaton did take risks , however , is in his physical , daredevil comedy . That 's Keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode . Reportedly , he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again . And , it was n't just Keaton who took risks ; the anachronistic baseball gag , for example , was rather dangerous . Thus , although in a different way , Keaton , like Griffith , took risks with his big film . And , I think they both succeeded .
1 As is well - known among long haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this Herr Graf 's silent rants , during summertime aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well hordes of coarse people taking their ease . Such bizarre travels around the world also happen in " Three Ages " , a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands , namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline.<br /><br />Obviously this German count liked most the first segment focused on the Stone Age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about that ancient time . preferring that to the second segment which takes place during the glory of Rome ( It should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman empire , that is to say , Barbarians , or the same thing , Germans ) . Of course , the third segment takes place during modern times but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern.<br /><br />The leitmotiv that moves Herr Keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious happenings during three different ages , is the search for love , a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self interest . Every time that " Three Ages " is shown in the Schloss theatre , it is always a pleasure to watch a funny , witty silent film ( even for a serious German count ) , an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets , puns , pratfalls and acrobatics , visual and astounding technical tricks , an absolute silent delicatessen that is perfect to allow one to endure the various and coarse summertime severities.<br /><br />And now , if you 'll allow me , I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must flirt with an old Teutonic heiress who does n't look her age.<br /><br />Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
1 Although the movie is clearly dated , audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless Buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale . Buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages : the Stone Age , The Roman Age , and the Moden Age , playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different " ages " . In this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the " caveman " stereotype , who wins his love not by romance but by brute force , as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial combat , two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as Mel Brooks ' " History of the World : Part I " . The underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing : Although the times may have - a - changed , we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to " win the girl " ( keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America , a time when chauvinism was still en vogue ) . It is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later , and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie 's " modern times " to now .
1 One of the ten best comedies ever < br /><br />This seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings . Keaton 's comedies are _ innerly , harmoniously , intelligently ordered , thought.<br /><br />Wonderfully amusing , deliberately delightful and inventive , THREE AGES should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if I were to sketch one . A threefold love story will enchant the viewers ; I want to bring here this approachKeaton 's comedy is like Lang 's DESTINY upsidedownor À REBOURS . Again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the Stone Age , in Rome and in Keaton 's timesin a Mohammedan country , in Renaissance Italy and in China . The same device works in the both moviesone , a grim , eerie melodrama ; --the other , a light , virtuouslypaced comedy . At Keaton it 's essentially the same couple ; and maybe the same is with Lang . The babe desired by both Buster and Beery is nice . I have found THREE AGES well written and smart , without being ostentatiously sophisticated ; the plot is basically very POPEYElikethe babe is a piece of furniture , the only protagonists are the two male rivalsKeaton and Beery.<br /><br />Keaton 's movie is simply enormously likable , and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it 's not , but it is grand fun , large fun , ample fun . And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis .
1 This movie is really funny ! ! The General is Keaton 's finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious - in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor . We watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier !
1 Buster Keaton was finding his feature length voice in " Three Ages . " There are some fine sequences , but it does n't quite hang together . The " chariot race " in " Three Ages " is hilarious . Included are 2 shorts , one of which , " The Goat , " is excellent .
1 This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism ( of heterosexuals ) . The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character . Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald / Geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting . The directing of Christopher Monger is very sensitively , treating such a difficult issue quite excellently , packed into a good story . Not a big movie , neither an " art " film , but a little , lovely motion picture !
1 When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in drag in this movie , my expectations that I would watch the entire movie were low . The only reasons I gave it a chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend.<br /><br />What i thought would be a broad " Mrs. Doubtfire " type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy . Pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross - dressing on occasions . He transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion . Julie Walters is magnificent , is as her habit , as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love .
1 This one took me by surprise because i had often been disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past , but he caught the perfect balance in this performance , avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humour and real emotions . The always - wonderful Julie Waters is terrific here , and anyone who has not yet scene her in 1983 's Educating Rita should rent it immediately ( marvelous film ) . The rest of the supporting characters are well - played as well , many marvelously eccentric without going over the top . This one is fun .
1 Julie Waters is always marvelous but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender - bent comedy about a transvestite who can not suppress his obsession , and the changes he goes through when he 's discovered . Unerringly eschews the vulgar , raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight , and has an absolute ball while doing it . A very nice , low - key , feel - good , comedy
1 Somewhat too long and going over the top towards the end , this comedy is an utterly delightful , never condescending or ridiculing look into the problems of a " power man " , who likes to wear women´s clothes at nite.<br /><br />Julie Walters is lovely as always , but Adrian Pasdar is utterly credible and steals the film . He ( she)is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings .
1 Julie Waters is outstanding and Adrian Pasdar a revelation in a very warm , very real , and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young executive 's life . At the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you .
1 Adrian Pasdar is excellent is this film . He makes a fascinating woman .
1 With this topic , it is so easy to take cheap shots . You know , the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe . Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does a superb job of making Gerald a REAL person , someone you care deeply about , and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine . Not only that , but as Geraldine , he looks HOT ! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric . These are two characters who feel love for one another , and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table . Even the potentially cheesy sub - story line of corporate takeovers is believable , and you find yourself cheering at the end ! At least I did !
1 Since Educating Rita , Julie Walters has been one of my role models , and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent . I would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress , but Walters pulls it off with gusto and panache . Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to - date in the male lead .
1 That film is absolutely fantastic ! ! If you watch it with your friends it can be a very nice day ... Obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and acted ( Tomba / Unziker what a couple ) , and that is probably the worse film in the world , but you can enjoy it very much . We watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening . The best scenes are the first one , when the criminals kill the friend of Alex , and he tries to act like a desperate , and the result is a comic scene of first category ... And then when he shows to Leva ( Antevleva , what a name ) the " Palassio di giusstissia " , and then the accident of Leva , that once is going on her car out of the road , and a second later , the car is completely empty ! What a magic !
1 I 've recently watched this movie , in a lazy Sunday afternoon , with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun ! This movie is a masterpiece of trash . Try to watch it with this purpose ! It had n't been expected , of course , but the performance provided by the actors ( and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best ) , the weak script and the low - cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things . Tomba was just retired from alpine ski racing , where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s . Tomba won three Olympic gold medals , two World Championships , and nine World Cup season titles . Seriously about the director : nobody knows why Damiano Damiani he has signed this movie . All the other Damiani 's directions are considerable .
1 A kid with ideals who tries to change things around him . A boy who is forced to become a man , because of the system . A system who hides the truth , and who is violating the rights of existence . A boy who , inspired by Martin Luther King , stands up , and tells the truth . A family who is falling apart , and fighting against it . A movie you ca n't hide from . You see things , and you hear things , and you feel things , that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real . Violence , frustration , abuse of power , parents who ca n't do anything , and a boy with , I am sorry , balls , a boy who will not accept things , who will not let anything happen to him , a kid with power , and a kid who acts like a pro , like he has never done anything else , he caries this movie to the end , and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the 60'ies .
1 I saw this movie today and I have to say , it was much much better than I expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it . Personally I had some prejudice due to the language of it , but it did totally change my idea . The movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances . It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it . This really touched me and as a film , which is based on a true story , it convinced me . A new school , psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher , a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they does n't seem to work out . It showed how little things can make huge changes in many things , and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations . Also I think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly . It really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened . Before I spoil this movie with praises , I have to admit that there were some things and situations that did n't look and feel realistic .. like the one where the headmaster of the school beat Frits aka . Martin in front of the class , at the end of the movie . He really got beaten badly , but the only thing that it caused to him , was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning , when Frits got some stitches .. well I guess every movie has it own faults .. have to say , that if I someday somewhere find this DVD from the store , it 's sure thing , that I take it with me .
1 I just picked up the DVD release of this movie while on holiday in Norway where it has been released with English subtitles.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted . The youngster portraying ' Frits ' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him.<br /><br />Early on in the film we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father.<br /><br />The climactic scene where Frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster ; simply standing his ground and repeating ' Liar ' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget.<br /><br />The films only weak point is the rather clichéd ' Flower Power ' teacher who uses every ' friendly teacher ' trick in the book . Other than this I feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy .
1 Insisting that Martin Luther King 's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere , Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school . More specifically , it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits ( Janus Dissing Rathke ) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen ( Bent Mejding ) . Adapted from a true story , the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving . A battle of ideologies between a 13 year - old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a " Dead Poets Society " more than a " Matilda " . It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man , manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money .
1 The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter.<br /><br />W. S. Van Dyke , MGM 's peripatetic director , was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit . His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 ( although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio ) . While considered a documentary at the time , we would likely term it a ' docudrama ' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storyline.<br /><br />The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo , both Winter & Summer , and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight . The constant striving for food is depicted , and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus , polar bear , whale & caribou . The native language is used throughout , with the use of title cards ; the only English is spoken by the fishermen & Mounties encountered by the Eskimo . In fact , it is the arrival of White Men , both good & bad , and the change they make on Eskimo society , which is a major element in the narrative.<br /><br />This Pre - Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code , particularly with their practice of wife - sharing , which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture . In fact , the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930's.<br /><br />None of the cast receives screen credit , which is a shame as there are some notable performances . Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise , playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo . Wise ( 1906 - 1952 ) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part . As handsome as any Hollywood star , he would continue acting , using the name of Ray Mala , in a sporadic film career , often in tiny unbilled roles.<br /><br />Lovely Japanese - Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala 's loyal second wife ; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure . Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector . The two decent - hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing , both longtime movie character actors . Danish author Peter Freuchen , upon whose books the film was based , has a short vivid role of an evil wooden - legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala 's icy wrath .
1 I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film , which was shot on location in Alaska . Although technically a melodrama , we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in , such as hunting , dancing , building igloos , etc . And their customs , such as offering their wives to visitors , are routinely in the story . The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage , as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals , but even these were fascinating . Spear fishing for salmon , hunting for walrus , caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times . There was no cast listing , which reinforced the documentary flavor . The film - makers tried to make it seem very authentic , with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles . The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police , there were no actors in the film , but this was not strictly true . The two leading characters , played by Mala and Lotus Long , were Eskimos by birth , but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on . But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers . All in all , the film is definitely worth a look .
1 I was really stunned how much a film , that 's over 60 years old could impress me . It is nearly two hours long , there are absolutely no stars in it , there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch . What impressed me mostly was the realism of the film . You could nearly feel the coldness of the ice , because you could see that the storms are real . This is a relief in a CGI - world like ourdays . I wondered how much work this must have been for van Dyke . I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it . Now who wants to talk about ' Titanic ' anymore ? It 's a great film with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects .
1 I want to add to the praise for the production of this film , especially the luminous cinematography . Firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery . The film was nominated for ( and won ) a single Oscar - the first given for editing . Mala 's performance is moody , penetrating and powerful .
1 Eskimo is a serious movie about the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man . Although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non - professionals , Eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot.<br /><br />The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscape . When an Eskimo man loses his mate , it is natural that other men share their women with their friend . It is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse . All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding Arctic setting . The trusting Eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers ( with heavy European accents ) that do not view these natives as their equals . Deceit , drunken orgies , rape , and death occur after the Eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas . Eventually the lead Eskimo ( Mala ) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge . The audience would have cheered in the 1930 's theaters.<br /><br />Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back Mala for trial . The Mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case . Will the Mounties get their man ? Is it fair to hold Mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society ? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala ? Is it inevitable that the white man 's law must prevail ? Is there no hope for innocence?<br /><br />This is not a great movie , but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting . I suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today 's disclaimer that none were injured in the making of the film -- so beware of the raw nature sequences . Highly recommended .
1 Here I thought " Nanook of the north " was the last word in archaic semi - doc ' eskimo ' movies . How wrong ! As an avid sea - kayaker I stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand - made ' skin - boats ' . The movie did not let me down . Any student of kayak / umiak construction should have a look - see here . ( Note to fellow SKers : they appear to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single blade paddles).<br /><br />But the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest . Even though there were as others have noted some little back - shot - fakey - bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance . It was ( from this very amateur anthropologist 's viewpoint ) probably the perfect time to make this movie . Early thirties : the ' talkies ' are so new that they ( including Louie B. Mayer ! ) actually let the Inuit speak in their own tongue . And there is so much that was still , despite the infused melodrama , authentic . They are really whacking that polar bear , that whale and those caribou . A fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with ' stars ' , Technicolor , etc . to gum it up . The seventies version ? Do n't even . A very good companion piece to this excellent movie is " White shadows in the south seas " ( 1928 ) Geograpically the mirror image to " Eskimo " it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of Western culture / technology on an unsuspecting people .
1 This zippy and fun short from 1916 - the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - features the young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er - do - well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit.<br /><br />Of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are rather more wives and babies than he can cope with ; plus the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick.<br /><br />Restored well it can be viewed as part of ' The Early Films of Oliver Hardy ' and is now available on DVD , a fine addition to the available corpus of the big screen favourite comedy duo .
1 I have seen virtually all of Cynthia Rothrock 's films , and to me this is the funniest . It reminds me of early Jackie Chan movies . Admittedly , Ms Rothrock may not be the greatest actress , but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady . This film , while probably not the best of all her films , was the most entertaining .
1 This group of English pros are a pleasure to watch . The supporting cast could form a series of their own . It 's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery , his wife , and a new pretty boy surgery resident . Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis , Michael Kitchen , and the sexy Robson Greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable " romp " . The only quibble is that it 's hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen , who like me , is hardly an international , or even a British sex symbol . You can readily understand why Robson Green would light her fire , with apologies to the " Doors " . The guy who almost steals the show with a great " laid back " performance is Owen 's father David Bradley . Watch him in " The Way We Live Now " , in a completely different performance , to get an idea of his range . Daniela Nardini as Kitchen 's secretary , sometime sex toy , is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body . Conor Mullen , and Julian Rhind - Tutt , as Green 's sidekick surgery buddies as I 've said could have their own series . They are that good . The whole thing is a great deal of fun , and I heartily recommend it , and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue .
1 Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer , a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be near his father . Along the way , he falls for Anna , a woman 20 years his senior , and who happens to be the wife of his new boss , Richard Crane . Despite warnings from his new colleagues , Owen proceeds to get Anna for himself , going as far as to sabotage Anna and the cheating Richard 's marriage . This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit . The actors are superb : Green of " The Student Prince " and " Touching Evil " smolders on - screen as the cunning , yet warm - hearted Owen ; Annis of " Dune " fame is lively and proves a good match to Green ; Kitchen , from " To Play The King " is the right menace as Richard , whose comic missteps and snobbery underline his masterful , building hatred for Owen . This is a perfect love triangle , and despite the foibles and fallacies of our three characters , you come away better for knowing and watching them .
1 This gripping tale of intergenerational love , jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast , with a sharper picture and crisper sound . My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times . Luckily even missing a word here and there wo n't spoil the fun : the primary actors are ideally cast . Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile , a go - for - broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he 's just begun to work . Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable ; her acting rivals her beauty . ( The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them ! ) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well . The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries . As Russell Baker notes in his introduction , you may not be morally improved by viewing " Reckless " -- but you 'll have plenty of fun . ( The sequel , a part of the DVD box set , provides a wild yet satisfying two - hour denouement . You wo n't want to miss it if you 've enjoyed what came before . )
1 Francesca Annis , Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green ! ! Wow , what a trio ... OK , so this is no Anna Karenina , but it is a good love story , very well - written and well - acted by all . Even a few ' laugh - out - loud ' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity , age bias , and parental aging / Alzheimer 's issues.<br /><br />Quirky guitar music added to the story as well.<br /><br />While I have been a fan of Ms. Annis ' since ' Lillie ' ( in the ' 70s ) and Mr. Kitchen 's since ' The Buccaneers ' and ' Enchanted April ' , I have only recently discovered Mr. Green ( ' Me and Mrs. Jones ' , ' Touching Evil ' , etc . ) , making me ask the question - why had I not seen ' Reckless ' until recently ? ? ! ! Admittedly more of a ' chick flick ' than something a man will sit through , it is perfect for a rainy afternoon 's lazy viewing .
1 I saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90 's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via Netflix ( convenient service by the way ) . All in all , I liked this lighthearted , sometimes genre challenged , mini series . The story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine . Yes , it does have some romance clichés of running in the rain or a train station goodbye , but the characters have a chance to be explored so it does n't seem cheesy , like it would be if this were some Tom Hanks vehicle or similar . Robson Greene , who at times reminds me of a separated - at - birth Scott Bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare . Personally , I think the series could have been done with two episodes , but that 's up for debate I suppose . Apparently , there 's a sequel , and that should be arriving tomorrow via Netflix .
1 To put it simply , I enjoyed this film . The reason for my interest & enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself . I had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how Northern England working class life and attitudes used to be ( as experienced by them)and this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me . In particular , the paternalistic but overbearing father who " knows " what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged . ( Not much has changed there then!!)<br /><br />People who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media . In a sense however , the film is an historical document and I personally enjoyed it , if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon .
1 Outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between Dads authority and their hopes and dreams.<br /><br / > The period is captured ; The bakelite light swithes , the Georgian floorpan , the picture rails , the wall paper , the short skirts , the cheeky lads , the Mini van , shiny modern mangles .... <br /><br / > The location is captured ; A wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape , walls of local stone , community , freedom.<br /><br / > But there is much much more ; Childhood , happiness , sensuality , pride , values , freedom , authority , rebellion , violence ( in the deepest sense ) , love , struggle , puberty , naivety , morality , trust , faith , deceit , machismo , manners , maturity , loss , poverty , sacrifice , horror , acceptence , revelation , comedy and parenthood are all there . ( And in no particular order!).<br /><br / > This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever . The fact that some of these are n't tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill , the story and the direction.<br /><br / > If there 's anything bad about this film , it 's that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end . Maybe I missunderstand - the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it ( * * ) - maybe the film is trying to send even that message too - well worth doing.<br /><br / > What is the film trying to say ? Kids : Parents were young too , parents struggle too , everyone makes mistakes , everyone learns , things change , struggle can end happily . Parents : Do n't try too hard ! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well being.<br /><br / > It sounds simplistic does n't it ? Sometimes the film feels like that too but it 's then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered.<br /><br / > The film is a classic.<br /><br / > ( * * ) - Not the problems themsleves .
1 As an native of Bolton , this film has obvious appeal for me . The location shots are fascinating and show a Bolton very much in transition - there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film . A slightly miscast James Mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full - blown generational conflict , then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution . Though I 'm a bit too young to remember it fully , the minutiae of Lancashire life in the 60s is all here : cashing up on a Friday , songs round the piano , the Sunday constitutional , good neighbourliness , the trepidations of courtship , the massive importance of self - respect , and I was pleased to see Naughton 's funniest lines from the play left intact . There is no doubt that this film ought to be made available on DVD - it is well crafted and most performances are well realised .
1 This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in Northern England . Filmed on location in Bolton , it stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home . Or so it seems . Cleverly , the film , based on the play , portrays the complexities of family life . The supporting cast is terrific as well , with many familiar faces lending support .
1 but I want to say I can not agree more with Moira.<br /><br />What a wonderful film.<br /><br />I was thinking about it just this morning , wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who 'd lost money on his debit card through fraud , and wanted to say ' Keep thy money in thine pocket ' and realised I was talking like James Mason.<br /><br />Even tho he did n't say those words , I still think he would ! I 've never forgotten ' Are ye carrying ? ' in his reconciliation with his son , Hywel Bennet : ' Always have money in thine pocket ! ' Good advice.<br /><br />Not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well - meant attitudes any more . Or any father at all.<br /><br />It would be a good thing for us to reinstate ' thee ' , ' thy ' and ' thine ' in our language to show we care . It is only the same as ' tutoyer ' in French or ' du ' in German.<br /><br />Addendum : I just realised that a lot of my remarks were about James Mason in The Family Way!<br /><br />I think it 's because I mixed up Susan George with Hayley Mills . Well , easy mistake.<br /><br />I stand by the comments tho'.<br /><br />And Spring and Port Wine is so very similar to The Family Way.<br /><br />When you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days , you really had something to say and talk about afterwards , something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development.<br /><br />Theatrical experiences are almost real , and they are important in helping young people to grow up.<br /><br />It does n't happen now , I think , that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did .
1 I love this film ' Spring and port wine ' . I was born in Leigh , a town about 7 miles away from Bolton , I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 . My place of work was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth , sometimes on a bike but then by car when I could afford it . The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could . Fred Dibnah was round the corner from Bromwich St. were my bedsit was . If you did n't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as Coronation St , well I agree it is a soap , but then , it was called ' Kitchen Sink Drama ! ' Watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on TV , I watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy !
1 Superb movie . Very good photography of 1969/70 Bolton , which seems now to be a different world . Thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production . James Mason a real first class star . It is and I would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure .
1 This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment . Its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one . The cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time , hence the name ' fraidy cat ' . Fraidy Cat 's previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different era 's in time and are constantly trying to kill him off , but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts . very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy . < br /><br />i watched this movie almost every day as a child :o)
1 Here is a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon perfect for Halloween . I know it dosen't have much creepiness , but has the ' trick ' as in " Trick or Treat , " as Jerry did to Tom with the window blind and the vacuum - cleaner with a collared - shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost ; but still like to put it on my list of Halloween cartoons . In this short , Tom was listening to the " Witching Hour , " a ghost - story program on the radio , and being frightened by the horror story being told . Halfway into the story , the dramatics ( hair standing on end , heart leaping into throat , icy chills on spine ) begin happening to Tom . . . literally . And Jerry has been observing the whole thing and laughing to himself , thought he highen Tom fears by scaring him.<br /><br />I love the ending , it was a little funny . And you know , This short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes ; the others being The Lonesome Mouse , A Mouse in the House and Nit - Witty Kitty . And also This short is the first of twenty - five cartoons where Tom speaks . The others are The Lonesome Mouse , The Zoot Cat , The Million Dollar Cat , The Bodyguard , Mouse Trouble , The Mouse Comes to Dinner , Quiet Please ! , Trap Happy , Solid Serenade , Mouse Cleaning , Texas Tom , Mucho Mouse , and The Cat Above and the Mouse Below directed by Chuck Jones .
1 " Fraidy Cat " , the 4th of these cartoons , is a good one . At least I like it , so I 'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews.<br /><br />This one is more of a macabre story than a funny one , although it has its moments of comedy . The atmosphere is dark and spooky . Suspense is another strong element here . As for humor , it 's mostly dark humor.<br /><br />In this short , Tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts , something he believes . While Tom is scared to death , Jerry is watching everything and ca n't help but laugh the whole time . In fact , Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more . With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big " ghost".<br /><br />Tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life . Although Jerry scares Tom without a good reason , the way the story is made ends up being funny . Plus , once again , there is no violence here because this is one of Tom & Jerry 's oldest cartoons . However , I do n't get that joke of Tom 's 9 lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />When Tom finally finds out that it was all a Jerry 's scheme and that Jerry made a fool out of him , Jerry is « caught with the hand in the cookie jar » ( he deserves to be discovered ) . Yet , Tom shows an incredible patience before reacting . He angrily looks at Jerry for about a minute . The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face . Jerry tries to be funny , but Tom does n't laugh.<br /><br />Overall , this is a different , peculiar and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience .
1 SPOILERS < br /><br />Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon , with a flawless idea , and almost every single short is a gem . While I must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic Tom and Jerry shorts , there is not way you can hate this cartoon . Sure , it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes , and I can say that I agree , but the fact of the matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great , but some are just better than others . Well , this would fit into " others . " < br /><br />Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat . Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast , and becomes easily frightened . Jerry observes how scared he is , and tries to scare him even more than he already is . He creates scary dilemmas for Tom , and Tom becomes scared out of his wits , and his lives . Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it , thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost . Tom finds out that Jerry did all of this , and chases him . Tom then accidentally bites the house maid . However , at the end Jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup.<br /><br />Overall , this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short out there , but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time . It makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this . The slapstick and gags in this that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short , but it felt like something was missing in this . It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts . Anyway , this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other Tom and Jerry cartoons , but it is still nice.<br /><br />7/10
1 This is my favorite of the older Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40 's . The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set , disc one , and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons . The gags on this one are n't all madcap Avery style , but more subtle and aimed at anyone who 's ever stayed up late watching scary movies ( or radio programs ) ! Tom is listening to a creepy radio show , and Jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him . The nine - lives gag is well done here , and I do n't know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when I was a kid . When Tom 's owner is awakened by the ruckus- Mammy was NOT the maid , it was HER house- she gets one heck of a surprise , with a big laugh . Get your pause button ready , it 's worth it !
1 Released some months before the end of the war , " Anchors Aweigh " is one of Gene Kelly 's major musical triumphs of the forties   < br /><br />Under the direction of George Sidney , it had the benefits of a pleasant score , andbest of allthe services of Gene Kelly in his first true starring role at MGM   The year before , in Columbia 's " Cover Girl , " he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen , a light but agreeable singing voice , and considerable charm In " Anchors Aweigh , " although he was billed under Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson , he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at MGM   < br /><br />The film 's story , a kind of dry run for " On the Town " four years later , follows sailors Kelly and Sinatra on shore leave , spend their holiday in Hollywood , where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer ( Grayson ) and her little nephew ( Dean Stockwell).<br /><br />Grayson , it appears , has her heart set on an audition with conductor - pianist Jose Iturbi   She gets the audition , of course ; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings ; and Sinatra , has forgotten to be shy , and has lost his heart to a girl from Brooklyn ( Pamela Britton).<br /><br />The plot is conventional for the period but , regrettably , it now seems barely tolerable   But there is Gene Kelly , who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality   Perhaps he grins too much , but when is permitted to dance , the film finally lifts off the ground   < br /><br />"I Begged Her , " his early song and dance with Sinatra , is amusing and slightly absurd , in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a Spanish courtyard , courting maiden Grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps   He also does a charming Mexican dance with little Sharon McManus in the square of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles  < br /><br />The highlight of the movie , however , is Kelly 's famous dance with the cartoon character Jerry the Mouse ( of " Tom and Jerry " fame ) . Delightful and innovative , it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly , a sailor in the " Pomeranian Navy , " wearing a striped shirt and a beret , shows him how to dance   " Look at me , I 'm dancin ' ! " says the gleeful mouse king ...
1 Everything a musical comedy should be . Gene Kelly ( as Joe Brady ) does n't miss a step , and Frank Sinatra ( as Clarence Doolittle ) does n't miss a note . Scenes with them together are very good , showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot . Sinatra 's " I Fall in Love Too Easily " is an indication of his then and future best . Kelly 's " Mexican Hat Dance " with a young Mexican girl is delightful . Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor . And there is a bushel of truly funny lines , like : " You think the navy takes dopes ? " ; " You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep ? " ; and , " We got in a little trouble , we picked up a little kid . " A thoroughly enjoyable movie , just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II .
1 ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors , Joe Brady ( Gene Kelly ) and Clarence Doolittle / Brooklyn ( Frank Sinatra ) , get a special four - day shore leave . Eager to get to the girls , particularly Joe 's Lola , neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navy - mad Donald ( Dean Stockwell ) and his Aunt Susie ( Kathryn Grayson ) . Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting , Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over . Along the way , however , Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend . How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal ? And does Joe end up with Susie , who loves him too?<br /><br />The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH , I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN , the Kelly / Sinatra collaboration from 1949 . Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structure -- all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot , and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them . Yet , both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall . Having now seen both films a third time , I still stand by that judgement . Somehow ON THE TOWN , as a film and a piece of entertainment , is just lighter , gayer , purely and simply * happier*. The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot , and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH . I 'm not quite sure why this is . The typical argument is that the latter film is over - long : at almost two and a half hours , this is certainly a valid criticism to make . I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it ! However , it 's also a film that grows on you -- the more you see it , the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making . And yet , something just does n't hang together quite right . It feels almost as if the script was pored over , and * every * single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted , and that 's exactly what happened . No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up ... and that 's probably the film 's biggest weakness . It has 16 numbers ( give or take a few ) , and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra , this really starts to turn one numb after a while . ( Contrast this , for example , with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN . ) You might well feel that each song , each dance , ca n't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking ... and that 's true . But that 's also because the writers were n't more restrained in adding them in in the first place.<br /><br />All this long preamble does n't mean there 's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH . The musical * is * splashy with great songs bursting out all over , like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra ( ' We Hate To Leave ' , ' I Begged Her ' and ' If You Knew Susie ' ) , the singing of Sinatra ( ' What Makes The Sunset ' , ' The Charm Of You ' , and the best of all , ' I Fall In Love Too Easily ' ) , and without a doubt the always inventive , always breathtaking dancing of Kelly . It 's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre . Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing ( her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening ) ; Jose Iturbi 's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it ; even Clarence 's own Brooklyn , Pamela Britton , is cute and charming ... as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself ! Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his , and plays the innocent boy - man wonderfully ( a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN ) . His singing is , as usual , simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing . His solo numbers might seem to drag a little , but when you 've got the voice of a century , showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film!<br /><br />Gene Kelly 's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph . Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively , ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kelly 's film . His Joe Brady is a believable , real character -- he 's tough on the outside , glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal , but he 's actually the biggest softy on the inside . Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying , but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands . And the * dancing*--again , the film suffers from the ' too much of a good thing spoils the effect ' syndrome , as it does with Sinatra 's singing . But once again , if it 's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe , or tapping across the screen in a sailor 's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief ... might as well err on the side of overdoing it ! All of Kelly 's dances are breathtaking , be it the pared - down simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to ' I Begged Her ' , his ' Mexican Hat Dance ' with the sweet wide - eyed little girl , or his lavish Spanish - influenced dance ' La Cumparsita ' . Of course , the classic image left in audiences ' minds for all time would be Kelly in his red , white and blue sailor suit , dancing with Jerry Mouse of ' Tom & Jerry ' fame . A well - deserved golden film memory , to be sure -- it 's not often that one can say you 're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 , given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market . But Gene and Jerry still look great , with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look . It * would * turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself ( in COVER GIRL ) and a cartoon animation . < br /><br />It 's doubtless that this first daring , inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs . But it 's also notable for being the first of three Kelly / Sinatra film collaborations , and though rather too drawn - out , still a great couple of hours of entertainment . Watch it first , then again and maybe again -- it'll grow on you before you realise it ! 7.5/10
1 The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars , and not 10 , is because 1 ) Sinatra is awful and 2 ) the love interest of Kelly 's character leaves much to be desired , ( IMHO ) . Do love that Dean Stockwell , Quantum Leap - Al , is the little boy . The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen . Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter 's . I 'm 28 and she 's 4 , so while the character is less iconic than Mickey , he is still a favorite of many children and adults today . Kelly is as always captivating , his eyes full of fun and excitement . In every movie I have ever seen him in , he always steals the show . One of the best dancers of the 20th century . It is no wonder Paula Abdul " sampled " Kelly 's moves . I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century . If you were to watch only one part , do n't miss Kelly 's dance with Jerry Mouse . You will NOT be disappointed .
1 In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly , Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical . I sure ca n't do better than that . It 's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra . Kathryn Grayson did n't do too badly with this either.<br /><br />Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it , Cover Girl became a classic . So if Mayer did n't learn a lesson , producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control . When Anchors Aweigh was finished , Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance.<br /><br />The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse . Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney 's Mickey Mouse , but Disney was n't lending Mickey out to nobody . Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film . Not to worry because MGM had it 's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry.<br /><br />Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire . For the next dozen years , these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves were n't up to snuff . It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity , Kelly for MGM , Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios . In Anchors Aweigh , Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit . In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity.<br /><br />When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own . He 'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn . In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film . Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing . One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh , I Fall in Love Too Easily . Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl . It 's Sinatra at his best . < br /><br />With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen , Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra 's mouth than any other person . They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career.<br /><br />On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale . They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings . She also did some classical numbers.<br /><br />Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot . Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell . Trying to fix her up with Sinatra , Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi . They spend the film trying to accomplish just that . < br /><br />My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton , who plays the waitress ' Brooklyn ' never got a number herself . She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that 's what brought her to Hollywood . I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM 's vaults it might still be.<br /><br />Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just are n't made any more . All that creative talent was under contract to Metro - Goldwyn- Mayer . If you had to pay market value for it , the cost might retire some third world country 's debt.<br /><br />But the film results would be extraordinary .
1 I saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it . Then I went home and watched it with subtitles and I loved it . I am ready to watch it again.<br /><br />I am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian ? The scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites.<br /><br />Of course the martial arts are stunning . There is really not much I can say about them if you are familiar with the HK style . However , if you are not ... we paused playback briefly and Walker , Texas Ranger was on . We noticed that after every strike there was a cut . Not in Black Mask.<br /><br / >
1 I am a massive fan of Jet Li ! He is THE best HK action film star alive ... and consequently - This film rocked ! I saw it in the video store and , as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store , I did nt register its presence at first , and had to look twice . I immediately knew what I would be renting out . My only qualm ( I suppose I expected it ) is that it was dubbed ( AAARGh ) and not subtitled . Elsewise , the movie 's original / strange / cool plot , and full on action made it one of Jet Li 's better movies ... even though they all fall under that category ....
1 Once again Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film Black Mask . In this film Li plays Tsui , an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him . To do this Tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life , but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace . Other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as Tsui , but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace . Thus Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives . This film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go . The martial arts is amazing , but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by American audiences . If you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts , then Black Mask is for you . I am glad to see that some of Jet Li 's movies are finally getting main stream release in the United States and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require ( things like dubbing and soundtrack ) will affect the film . This is one of Li 's best films , go out and see it on May 14 when it is released in America .
1 I 'm no big fan of Martial Arts movies , but the video shop was nearly empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it free when the other films I 'd rented , either way I rented it . I absolutely loved it , my flatmate and myself ( 22 year old Biochemistry and Accountancy students ) spent the half hour after the film making strange Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other . I ca n't explain it ( well maybe a little tequila ) . I never enjoyed Bruce Lee , skinny bloke kicking big bloke , beating him , kicking bigger bloke etc film ends . Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action .
1 This is definitely one of Jet 's best efforts . Few actors are able to play the stoic as Jet Li can . The action is rapid - fire , and special - effects boosted for intensity purposes . As a result , it may take Americans a little off - guard . A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li film . I feel that it is an excellent introduction to Jet 's work and look forward to further masterpieces ( especially Fist of Legend ) making it into the US market . A nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts .
1 The story deals about Jet Li who has to fight against his old < br /><br />friends . But there is one problem , the friends are superfighters . The film is filled with blood , super action and the best stunts forever . And Lau Ching - Wan is a great Co - actor . Of course the movie has the typical HK - Fun . But I love it ! In Germany " Black Mask " is uncut .
1 A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition . But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling ( and not so ) LA actor . It brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit . It 's also got a polished look and very adept direction under Monika Mitchell . Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that does n't compromise its production values at any level . The writing is tight , the dialogue first rate . Cassini is an actor 's actor , and the role really shows off his talents . The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic , and may go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time . I saw it at an advanced screening , and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards .
1 After seeing ' Break a Leg ' in Vancouver at the release party I thought it was a very enjoyable film.<br /><br />I had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos ( Eric Roberts in particular ) were a scream . I have n't heard word about actual release date although I 've heard it 's close.<br /><br />The story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations . The script is smooth and seamless , the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh . This film has won at least one award from EACH of the film festivals it 's been in , which is around 10 - 15 or so.<br /><br />I highly recommend ' Break a Leg ' .
1 I was pleasantly surprised I quite liked this movie . Witty writing ( some " inside " jokes I got , others I did n't - maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another ) , great acting ( notably John Cassini ) , great cameos , interesting and unique directing . I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek ( very disappointed he was in it such a short time , blink and you 'll miss him ! ) but found the movie remarkably entertaining . I 'll actually watch it again before I send back to Netflix . I think actors and wanna - be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie . The ending is somewhat expected but wish they 'd done something different ( and more positive ) . Too bad the movie was n't better received except for in the " festival " market . I suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz .
1 This movie 's origins are a mystery to me , as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it . I assume that before " Starship Troopers " , " Killshot " was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network , cable , or otherwise . The new title of " Kill Shot " is comically thrown into the opening sequence , the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema . The quick cuts , cheesy " Melrose Place " music , and short 2-second close - up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you 're in for.<br /><br />And I do n't mind at all . I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers ( an excellent book , in my opinion , not so hot a movie - but that 's another review ) . After looking it up on IMDB , my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career ( see Bond - Girl and Wild Things references here ) . They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted R - rated status - coveted in suspense Video Rental sections , that is . In any event , they should have left it unrated if you 're trying to sell it in the suspense / softcore porn section.<br /><br />All in all , it 's entertaining . I hate to spoil the fun of telling you it 's a TV pilot , though . That was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a TV show , the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual.<br /><br />Would I rent it again ? No . Would I watch this TV show ? Well , why not - it 's better than Baywatch . And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s . Token black guy ( who 's gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter - racial dating ) , token Asian ( Japanese , I assume from the name Koji ) more adept at science and computers than talking to women , beautiful , intelligent Latina pre - med student who has everything going for her except her family 's bank account - this show probably would have done ok.<br /><br />But as a movie it just cracks me.<br /><br />I gave it a 7 out of 10 , considering what it was and what it was forced to become . It made for a very enjoyable evening , and that 's all I ask of rentals .
1 Despite the lack of logic present in the storyline , Kill Shot is a highly enjoyable film . Through a moving performance Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son . Each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance , highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name I can not recall . A shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers , but as a whole Kill Shot truly delivers a death blow .
1 Trapped : buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened , and is soon to close.<br /><br />We start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts , to avoid the possibility of avalanches . somehow , that does n't make sense . anyways , he 's about to blow away one particularly big one , when he notices the resort is open . despite his best efforts , higher authority tells him his day is over.<br /><br />soon , as everyone expects , an avalanche hits.<br /><br />Look , i 'm not gon na reveal any more , all i can say is this was a B - movie designed for the family channel ( which i just saw it on , and the fact it had no commercials proves it 's a B - movie ) anyways , it 's a pretty decent film , but it 's partially unreal.<br /><br />firsthand , when people are buried by ice and snow , they 're buried . not just traced by powder . or , what about a CD for a screwdriver ? it 's not possible . and finally , what i ca n't stress enough , is that an explosion can not stop a avalanche , guaranteed.<br /><br />furthermore , it 's worth a rental or a TV viewing , but not owning . 7/10.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG , but maybe it should have received something a little more strong . a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator , but his leg is cut around the ankle , a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel , and in the weight room , dead people are laying around.<br /><br />enjoy .
1 Really enjoyed this little movie . It 's a moving film about struggle , sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples ( the child actor who plays Miki is especially good ) . There 's so many large scale impersonal films set around WW2 , that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm , and an original one at that . I 'll also add that this film is far from boring , very far ! ! Of course the Horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking . To anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family ( I do ) , you 'll find this film especially rewarding . Recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different .
1 Given the low budget and production limitations , this movie is very good . It is plausible , realistic , and shows how the Csikos ( Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains ( puszta ) risked their lives to save a downed American pilot from the ruthless and savage Nazis . We are drawn into strong feelings for the young , impressionable , yet highly courageous boy -- who admires the American pilot . If you 're looking for special effects , superman heroes , and magical endings -- this movie is not for you . If you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent , amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion , then you will be enthralled by this movie . I truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses , dogs , and humble , helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end , this movie will be one you 'll remember for a long time .
1 Sad story of a downed B-17 pilot . Brady is shot down over occupied territory . The local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives . I had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours . After the film is over , I 'm glad I took the time . It 's an entire story told to explain the look on Brady 's face at the start of the film .
1 A beautiful movie , especially if you like horses , WWII films and the austere Hungarian Plateau . A story of courage , compassion and loyalty that transcends generations . The horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters ' horse in his own training.<br /><br />I will buy this movie and watch it again . This is a family film and I recommend it highly . A good ' ' Family Nite '' movie . Although there are some violent scenes , it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary . The native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down Brady . A hauntingly beautiful film .
1 This movie is why I found this website . I could n't find this movie anywhere else ! I am so glad we found it here ! We have seen it on TV before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it . One other poster commented that it is was boring , though I must say that it is NOT . Especially if you are a horse person , you will love this movie . The horses are awesome , well trained and the movie is well done . It is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home DVD library . We will be recommending it to our friends . The bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses . This is certainly a movie that we will watch several times .
1 This movie was made in Hungary i think . anyway , the countryside is gorgeous , the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating . their horsemanship is awesome . I got more into the native people , the farm life , and how heroic they were trying to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who where looking for these parachutists . They even sacrificed their life in several instances . the young orphan lad that Brady befriends was a sweet kid . you will marvel at the riding i think , and the action of trying to evade the Nazis . it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others . Ladies have hankies handy , as you will be devastated at the end . i own it , and have watched it several times . in other words , not just a one time around flick . its a keeper ....
1 How can anyone not love this movie ? I think it 's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies ; if you 've never seen them , watch this instead . Michael Keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes . One guy mangles the English language everytime he talks and Griffin Dunn plays a clueless D.A. , but my favorite role has got to be Joe Piscopo . He has all the best lines . Danny DeVito , Alan Hale , Ray Walston are in this star - studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than " Mafia " did for the criminal underground .
1 This movie is just too funny , a totally non - PC gangster romp . If Mel Brooks made a picture about the Mob in the 30 's , it would probably look like this . Too many great one - liners to to remember , and while its not for everyone , anyone who DOESNT laugh a whole bunch of times does nt have a pulse . So , put it on and LAUGH you Iceholes ! ! !
1 For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem . Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually funny ! Maureen Stapleton is a scene stealer . The Moroni character is an absolute scream . Watch for Alan " The Skipper " Hale jr . as a police Sgt .
1 Famous words of foreign nightclub owner Roman Maroni , that " lousy cork sucker " who spends the whole movie not only as Johnny Dangerously 's rival , but butchering the English language as well.<br /><br />Another underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon matinées or " Late Late Late Show " 's , Johnny Dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother 's medical care and put his brother through law school.<br /><br />Yes there 's a story , but who cares ? ? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo , Dom DeLuise , Marilu Henner , and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next.<br /><br />There 's too many laughs in this to put on here . Like Airplane , you have to pay attention or you 'll miss something . Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two ! ! !
1 One the whole , this movie is n't perfect . It does n't ' hang well ' together as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes.<br /><br />Some of these jokes are a little ' too 80s ' and tend to date the picture.<br /><br />But some of these jokes are classic.<br /><br />You know a movie has something special when you and your friends still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later.<br /><br />Plus , there are a bunch of familiar faces ; Michael Keaton , Danny Devito , Joe Piscapo , Peter Boyle , Marilu Henner , Maureen Stapleton , Bob Eubanks , Griffin Dunne , and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr. , the Skipper from Gilligan 's Island.<br /><br />Also , there are some great absurdist moments , like when Johnny is labelling the puppies with a pricing gun , or the Pope making an appearance in Johnny 's neighborhood . Also , the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in Latin is excellent . ( " Summa cum laude , magna cum laude , the radio 's too louda ... Post meridian , ante meridian , uncle meridian").<br /><br />Other Classic Scenes include Ramone Maroney butchering the English language Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne to ' Play Ball ' Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood The fake VD movie < br /><br />This movie is no home run . But like ' Porky 's ' , it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable .
1 The jokes are obvious , the gags are corny , and the characters are walking characatures - but I could n't stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie . No matter how many times I see it , I still get a kick out of this one , and I recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment . It contains many quotable moments , and some of the best sight - gags I 've seen to this day . If you 've had a bad week and you need a chuckle , rent this one on your way home Friday night to give your weekend a good start .
1 Oh , what fun there is here ! < br /><br />Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Look Who 's Talking ) but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun . Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny , easily his best screen performance . Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin , what a shame directors did n't pick up on this . And I have even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character 's unique vocabulary . I do n't think it 's an accident that the bulk of the character 's name is spelled MORON.<br /><br />Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie , with Peter Boyle , Griffit Dunne . Maurren Stapleton , Merilu Henner given good lines . Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in a good lines.<br /><br />recommend it to a friend .
1 As far as parody films go , there are few that are worth time and energy . but with a recent resurgence of horrid parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks , it is a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce like Johnny Dangerously.<br /><br />After his mother has no end of medical problems , little Johnny goes to work for the mob . What fallows is a series of gags , most of which work , there are , however , the occasional flops . But a foreign gangster who ca n't master the American language ( profanity wise , at least ) , a rival gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off ( ... once ! ) , a younger brother with the D.A. who is out to get Johhny Dangerously , and a hot young starlet hot for his affections have Johnny busy.<br /><br />And the viewer will be busy laughing , for the most part , as every gangster - movie cliché is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing.<br /><br />Not perfect by a long shot , but definitely good for a smile on a bad day .
1 Okay - I 'll confess . This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do . He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney , with charm to spare.<br /><br />The supporting cast are solid workers all , and will step right up and do a fine job in this ' 80s comedy . A spoof of the ' 30s-'40s gangster movies , it breaks new ground constantly , with remarkably original material . ( Well , yeah - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made , it was original , and much of it has _ not _ been copied elsewhere . ) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people to not do _ _ _ _ _ _ , with one of the great taglines of spoofs . Watch Roman Moronie do things with English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh . Watch amazing sight gags , such as pet - store owner Johnny Kelly using the price - tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens . Watch the greatest " warning against sex " educational film ever made . Watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church Latin done , while a guy who never took shop class assembles a Thompson machine gun from parts . Watch lines you 'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade . Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard - working mom , with surprise gags that you 'll never see coming.<br /><br />If you see a gag that does n't hit your funny bone , be patient - another will come along in 30 seconds or less , and the odds are , you 'll need to pause until you 're done rolling on the floor several times . Duckies and Bunnies ? Them , too . Watch for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings.<br /><br />There are a few minor flaws - but it 's probably the best of the spoofs . Some come close , but none of them are quite this good .
1 Yes , Keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film . With a skip in his step in his tailored pin - striped suits , he 'll remind you of Jimmy Cagney ! Johnny ( Keaton ) is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother 's high - priced medical bills & to send his younger brother ( Griffin Dunne ) to law school . No one even knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerously until later on in the film . Joe Piscopo is Vermin & does n't like Johnny one bit ( & I do n't like Vermin ) . Marilu Henner has a nice singing / dancing routine while Johnny revels in it . I love the part when they 're in the ever - changing getaway car ! The cop who 's " calling all cars " is the Skipper from Gilligan 's Island ! See this one for 1930 's gangster laughs ! The gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you 'll miss them ! Look in the background of every scene .
1 " Johnny Dangerously " is a sort of hit and miss comedy that has it 's laughs and " huh ? " . But I suggest to give it a chance . I think it is greatly over looked . Not too many people give this movie a chance . It does work . Just think of it as a little parody of " Goodfellas " . Michael Keaton is very funny in his role . And he does it well . Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life . He just works his way up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife . And of course like a lot of the mob movies , someone wants him dead . 90 % of the jokes get a laugh . Like , I said give it a chance . Just take your favortie gangster movies and mix a comedy in . You have " Johnny Dangerously " . < br /><br />7/10
1 Sure it may not be a classic but it 's one full of classic lines . One of the few movies my friends and I quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later ( Maybe it was on Cinemax one too many times ! ) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie -- he ca n't seem to figure out how to play it-- but he 's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof . Looking for a movie to cheer you up ? This is it but rent it with friends -- it'll make it even better .
1 All of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean , tongue - in - cheek humor . Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work . This is not a blockbuster , bigger - than - life affair . This is campy , slapstick humor played out by some of Hollywood 's best ( and very versatile ) actors . Piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee , once.<br /><br />If you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed , you got ta see Dimitri do his piece as Morone.<br /><br />I gave it a 7 .
1 This movie is just a lot of fun . I 've seen it a couple of times , but it always has something funny that I remember . The " duckies and bunnies " car scene is one of my favorites , and I still quote Morone 's versions of certain words!<br /><br />There are so many running jokes , that it 's amazing . But I love Michael Keaton anyhow !
1 This movie is utterly hilarious . Its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films . The conflict of brother vs. brother appears when Johnny 's brother becomes a do - gooder D.A. However , the best character is Johnny 's crimelord rival , the overly accented Moroni . As Johnny says " That man should be arrested for butchering the English language." < br /><br />Check it out on video . It 's worth a look .
1 If this movie proves only one thing , it 's that Keaton is , was and always will be a comic at heart , even when dodging bullets , heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison.<br /><br />But " Johnny Dangerously " goes on to prove even more . In the ' 80s , the ZAZ boys ( Zucker , Abrahams , Zucker ) were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs . But there were several pretenders to the throne . This time , Amy ( " Fast Times at Ridgement High " ) Heckerling tries her hand , with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script ( go and check ) . < br /><br />This slap - happy slapstick spoof of the 1930 's cops - and-"gag"sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that did n't exist way back when.<br /><br />And not only is the ever - dependable Keaton on hand as the Johnny of the title , but so are such funny guys and dolls as Piscopo , Henner , Stapleton , Boyle , Dunne , DeVito , Walston and just about every other actor in Hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity . You 'd be surprised by how many faces you 'll recognize . I know I was.<br /><br />And the jokes ? Well , when they start out , they come at you fast and furious , like a machine gun . There are too many to count in the beginning , topped off with a crazy theme song by Weird Al Yankovic . But you have to watch for when they reload . And they have to reload a little too often . < br /><br />Everyone tries , they seem to be having fun and I was laughing a good amount of the time . In the end , though , there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy.<br /><br />But for a slow night when there 's nothing good on TV , pop in " Johnny " and be ready for some " Dangerously " serious laughter.<br /><br />Eight stars . Check out " Johnny Dangerously " ... do n't be a " bastidge " .
1 " Roman Troy Moronie " is my comment on the movie . What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the moron in Moronie . A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words , well , it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently . < br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course great comedy among the other characters . Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an " R " rating because he could not pronounce profanity .
1 I could not believe the low 5.6 rating on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously at the moment I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as I can . Seriously , to get a rating so low , the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor , not to mention a very shallow opened mind . If you do n't like humorous flicks , do n't watch them ! Combining absurd humour , a very good storytelling , and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags , this movie has made its way into my DVD collection . And that is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there and of course , the use of " clin d'oeils " and " clichés " based on our favorite organized crime movies . < br /><br />I showed this movie to a lot of people and , being introduced to it without any specific expectations ( except maybe watching a comedy)- the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion - they all liked it very much . It goes well , it 's not long to watch and there are absolutely no slowing downs in the evolution of the story , which I think is really straightforward . Sure it 's not perfect , some gags fall a bit short , but no movie is perfect , especially when considering other opinions that yours . That is why I rated this movie 9 out of 10 . This movie is in my opinion a precursor like " Top Secret " and " Spaceballs " in the field of absurd but well - thought comedies . Which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and ingeniosity side . Sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly , if at all . As a final word , I would like to say : watch it for yourself , do not follow average Joe 's saying and if you do n't like it , then you 'll know for real it was not good for your tastes , which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion .
1 This did for crime what " Not Another Teen Movie " did for school . I laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves . An unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way . I suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30 's .
1 Just like wine , " Johnny Dangerously " gets better and better with every day . This clever , witty , well - acted film could very well stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre , it 's truly outstanding . In fact , it 's quite obviously the best film of its kind ... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although , admittedly , this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive , vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as " Jane Austen 's Mafia " .
1 Michael Keaton is " Johnny Dangerously " in this take - off on gangster movies done in 1984 . Maureen Stapleton plays his sickly mother , Griffin Dunne is his DA brother , Peter Boyle is his boss , and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend . Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo . Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him , in flashback , how he came to own the pet store . He turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation ( $ 49.95 , special this week ) and began working for a mob boss ( Boyle ) . Johnny uses the last name " Dangerously " in the mobster world.<br /><br />There are some hilarious scenes in this film , and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny 's foul - mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced . Peter Boyle as Johnny 's boss gives a very funny performance , as does Griffin Dunne , a straight arrow DA who wo n't " play ball " with crooked Burr ( Danny De Vito ) . As Johnny 's nemesis , Joe Piscopo is great . Richard Dimitri is a standout as Moronie , who tortures the English language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it . What makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face.<br /><br />The movie gets a little tired toward the end , but it 's well worth seeing , and Keaton is terrific as good boy / bad boy Johnny . For some reason , this film was underrated when it was released , and like Keaton 's other gem , " Night Shift , " you do n't hear much about it today . With some performances and scenes that are real gems , you 'll find " Johnny Dangerously " immensely enjoyable .
1 even though this movie is quite old , no matter how many times i watch it , it still makes me laugh . < br /><br />one particular quote in the movie stands out . < br /><br />when Danny ( Joe Piscopo ) pulls up to the d.a 's office & parks in a disabled spot , Danny 's partner says < br /><br / > " ca n't park here , it 's for the handicapped " . < br /><br />Danny replies " i am handicapped , i'm psychotic".<br /><br />that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch , it 'll make you chuckle.<br /><br />Johnny Dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy / spoof movies of all time.<br /><br />As an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the cast . So watch this movie & like myself & many others who have watched it , you 'll be hooked .
1 What ever happened to Michael Keaton ? What a great actor and he proves it in this movie . This movie is actually FUNNY ! And the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons : an excellent script and Michael Keaton . This movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of Hollywood . This movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies . In this movie , Hollywood actually pokes fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy . The rest of the cast is funny too , especially the supporting cast . If you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor , then this movie is for you .
1 If your a fan of Airplane type movies this is a must see ! Set in the 1920 's and 30 's Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors but great lines . " knock down dat wall , knock down dat wall and knock down dat # @$%#@$ wall . " " You should n't hang me on a hook johnny " or " Sounds like Johnnys getting laid " . Its definitely a spoof of the old James Cagney Movies and references them a lot . There 's a great scene when Jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape . Listen closely to the fake priests readings , its pretty funny . Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope . Watch his reaction to Johnny after he tips the Pope , a lot said without making a sound . I recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs .
1 Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it 's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense . But that 's the point , right?<br /><br />The cast is likable ; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed . Griffin Dunne , Peter Boyle , Joe Piscopo , Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me . But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri ( sneaking the word " Iceholes " into movie history ) as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.<br /><br />I associate many childhood memories with this film , as I watched it quite often so maybe I 'm prone to enjoy it more than many others . Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking ( and sex).<br /><br />I like it but it 's hard to recommend.<br /><br />7 out of 10 .
1 Although critically maligned , Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I 've ever seen . It 's a movie that should be watched closely ; some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them . For instance , keep an eye on Michael Keaton 's use of the pricing gun at the pet store ... and also on the documentary - style years that appear at the beginning of scenes . It 's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly , even though you know it 's a comedy . Amy Heckerling , the director , is really sharp here -- If you enjoyed her better known films ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Clueless , European Vacation , etc.,)you should give this one a look.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast ( Griffin Dunne , Maureen Stapleton , Joe Piscopo , Peter Boyle ) is excellent . Highly recommended .
1 This film is one of Michael Keaton 's best . Throughout the film he is ' on ' . With co - stars like Ms. Henner , Joe Piscopo and Danny DeVito , you ca n't go wrong . Great laughs , great fun for everyone .
1 Twenty five years ago , I showed this film in some children 's classes in Entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids ; they were spellbound ! It is not just about the termites who have built and live in the " Castles of Clay , " but also about the other animals who use the mounds . There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch . It is a not only good for entomology classes , but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds . < br /><br />I wish it was available on DVD , so that I could watch it again and show others .
1 I agree whole - heartedly with the comments so far . I remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative I 've ever seen . As stated before , I recall that I began watching , thinking it was just another nature study - interesting , not necessarily special , but I was so wrong . Not only was the story of the colony incredible , but I remember the music as being so much a part of it 's appeal . If I remember correctly , it was Native Americn pipes ( akin to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo 's Nest ) . I , too have been looking for a copy . This should be required watching for anybody , but especially the schools . It should be re - released .
1 I showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it . I loved it , too . The story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing . The cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well . The battle between the two cold - blooded titans is truly classic footage.<br /><br />Alan Root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the Best Documentary Oscar . The copy I have does n't have Orson Welles narrating it ( Derek Jacobi ) and it is n't called the " Mysterious Castles of Clay , " just " Castles of Clay . " This makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added for star power and an Oscar push.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to find this VHS just recently and it is now my children 's favorite movie . They brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a Disney movie . If you can find this movie you are indeed lucky .
1 Lizzie Borden 's Love Crimes is an important film , dealing with the dark side of female sexuality ( and including full frontal female nudity , which sure beats the male kind ) . It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory.<br /><br />This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky , but Borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust.<br /><br />One striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses , when the antagonist , a counterfeit fashion photographer , is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse . He shoves a riding crop between her legs , pressing it against her crotch , and this greatly increases her excitement.<br /><br />Then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door.<br /><br />Patrick Bergin plays the con artist , and though he falls a long distance from handsome , he picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line . By all reports , Sean Young proves a weird person , and she is scarcely beautiful . Yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long - limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination . Her performance is forceful and complex.<br /><br />Borden possesses an intriguing worldview , and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist I truly appreciate .
1 This is by far my favorite film of all time . That 's mainly because it 's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics ( such as spanking and female submissiveness ) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch . Nothing seems to be off - limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer . However , I do n't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone . Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance . Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it . The other cast members do a fine job as well.<br /><br />Have you noticed that this movie has n't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters ? Have you ever wondered why ? The obvious reason is that it just does n't fit today 's political atmosphere . It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn ( that 's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn ) but will not carry a mainstream movie like " Love Crimes " . Sadly , even though this movie is only 11 years old , it could probably not be made today.<br /><br / >
1 In Lizzie Borden 's " Love Crimes " ( 1992 ) , Sean Young plays a gritty D.A. in Atlanta . She 's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man ( Patrick Bergin ) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women , takes compromising photos of them , then leaves them.<br /><br />Naturally , this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug 's life by posing as his prey , intending to bring him to justice . They meet , they make love , then the next thing she knows , she is over his lap , getting spanked . ( Note : The spanking scene is only in the " unrated " version of this film . The R - rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid . ) This psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images , such as Bergin chasing one of his victims around the room , flailing at her with a riding crop.<br /><br />As a thriller , " Love Crimes " is at its best when Sean Young is playing her cat - and - mouse game with Bergin , trying to catch him in an incriminating act . It 's unfortunate that the film does n't end , it just stops . That 's true . Director Lizzie Borden may have just run out of story to tell , but after 92 minutes the credits roll , and we are left with a puzzling " what just happened ? " bewilderment.<br /><br />The unfolding of Young 's plan is played out in engaging style , but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn - off for some viewers.<br /><br />Dan ( daneldorado@yahoo.com )
1 Petter Mattei 's " Love in the Time of Money " is a visually stunning film to watch . Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations . This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money , power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter . < br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler 's play about the same theme , the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect . Each one is connected in one way , or another to the next person , but no one seems to know the previous point of contact . Stylishly , the film has a sophisticated luxurious look . We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits . A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment , as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei 's direction . Steve Buscemi , Rosario Dawson , Carol Kane , Michael Imperioli , Adrian Grenier , and the rest of the talented cast , make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work .
1 ( Question ) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand ? ( Answer ) A good start . Well , I do n't know Peter Mattei from Adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests , " Love in the Time of Money " is a " good start " . A classy shoot with whimsical music box style music , this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ending with persons A & B in carousel fashion . The film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client . The downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received . I watched the behemoth " Angels in America " last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound . Use caution . I may be the only person who really liked this flick . ( B )
1 This film sat on my Tivo for weeks before I watched it . I dreaded a self - indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad . I was wrong ; this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed - up libidos of New Yorkers.<br /><br />The format is the same as Max Ophuls ' " La Ronde , " based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler , who is given an " inspired by " credit . It starts from one person , a prostitute , standing on a street corner in Brooklyn . She is picked up by a home contractor , who has sex with her on the hood of a car , but ca n't come . He refuses to pay her . When he 's off peeing , she answers his cell phone and takes a message . She runs away with his keys.<br /><br />Then the story switches to the contractor , who pays a professional call on a rich , bored New York woman , who plays with him until he is aroused , then she pulls away . She tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ; he tells her how beautiful she is , and lucky . As he is leaving , she asks if he would have sex with her . She sits on top of him , bounces up and down . This time he comes , the he leaves.<br /><br />The woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends . Hubby ( Robert ) is talking business , wife ( Ellen ) is bored , and switches the subject to sex , and how often men and women think about it . Husband switches conversation to desert . Later , after the guests leave , Ellen tries to entice Robert into sex . Robert wants none of it , and puts on a jazz record . Ellen turns on the radio ; Robert turns up the music ; Ellen turns on the TV ; Robert turns on another TV . Cacophony ensues . Ellen goes up on the roof , Robert joins her . Ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men , men other than Robert . Robert says that he too needs to experience men.<br /><br />We next follow Robert as he visits an artist , Martin , played by Steve Buscemi . I wish Buscemi could have more roles like this , where he is a sexy , smart , totally desirable guy . Robert praises Martin 's work , much more than it deserves , promises to get it into a show . Martin is excited , until it turns out that Robert is speaking out of his groin , it is all a mating dance . Robert tries to kiss Martin , on the lips , and Martin pulls back , saying that he is not gay . Robert asserts that he 's not gay either , Martin scoffs . Both admit that the artworks are bad . Robert is about to leave , when Martin allows Robert to kiss him . They make out , and Robert goes down on Martin.<br /><br />Next we follow Martin , as he prepares for an art show at a Manhattan gallery . He is smitten by the receptionist , Anna , played by Rosario Dawson . ( I had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words ) ... and they make love to each other.<br /><br />We next follow Anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . Her boyfriend , Nick ( Adrian Grenier ) , enters , bearing flowers . She is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . He coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in San Francisco . She coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - gf while in San Francisco , and had sex with her . The latter revelation turns out to be a lie . The two of them make out in the luncheonette , but she decides that they must break up . Nick is heartbroken.<br /><br />And we follow Nick , who confesses his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , Joey ( Carol Kane ) . Joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for Nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . The two of them go to Coney Island at night , and look at the stars . Nick falls under Joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . They go back to Joey 's apartment , and Nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . She is on top of him , does n't want to let him go . But he manages to escape.<br /><br />(This is , by the way , the best Carol Kane role since she played Latke 's wife in Taxi . ) Joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the Psychic Friends Network , and Joey is one of the psychic friends . Although she is still hurting from Nick , she gradually gets into her psychic shtick . The man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . Although that is not Joey 's business , Joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . She wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company , and will be found out tomorrow . His life is ruined . Joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . And she does care about him.<br /><br />But the man packs a gun into his briefcase , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the Brooklyn waterfront , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out La Ronde . She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if she will kill him . He tried to kill himself , but could n't do it . The prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . Eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and arriving at the corner where she normally does business . The contractor who did n't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , rolls down the window . They look at each other . THE END .
1 Overall , I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers.<br /><br />However , I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols ' Closer . One scene especially where Adrian Grenier 's character is questioning Rosario Dawson 's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen 's character is questioning Julia Roberts , although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in " Love . " Also note that " Anna " is the name of both Dawson 's and Roberts ' character . Ca n't be coincidence . Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber 's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler 's " Reigen " so I 'm not sure how this connection formed.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea ?
1 Terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking . Story builds in interest and complexity . Characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments . Superb New York City locations - gritty , real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of " Sex in the City " - in fact , the entire film is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion of New York City , sex and relationships . It 's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately . LOVED IT ! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi , Rosario Dawson , and her love interest ( forgot his name ! ) .

1 I chose to watch this film at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival . Both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level . The director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first - time production.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and New York City ( Brooklyn in specific ) . The movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice.<br /><br />This is gem and I would whole heartedly recommend it ( I 'm sure it will make it to the screen ) .
1 I understand this film to be a debut feature and as such , it is very impressive . It has the feel and pacing of a " true indie " , yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision , command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional . The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward . He , and screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical " paint by numbers " type scripts . It 's a story that needs Judd Hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working . Judd is fantastic as usual ; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd . The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden . Yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach . Anyway , I found the film refreshing and entertaining .
1 I found this movie thought - provoking , and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick - fix films where we are manipulated into loving the " good guy " and hating the " bad guy . " Scott Cohen , a very handsome television actor , does a great job of portraying the family black sheep / lost child who aspires to gain his father 's love and respect , as well as that of his widowed sister - in - law with whom he apparently has a history . Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.<br /><br />When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival , I was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition , as explained by the director.<br /><br />This is a fitting successor to the classic " Ordinary People . " I just realized , Judd Hirsch was in that , too !
1 I saw " Brother 's Shadow " at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later . The story of a prodigal son ( Scott Cohen ) returning to his family 's custom furniture business after a stint in jail , it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama -- memorable characters ; sharp , observant dialog ; sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually.<br /><br />But more than that , it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days : the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility . The talent of director - screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to emerge full - blown , but we get the sense he ( like his protagonist ) has paid his dues . He knows how real people struggle in this world , and he knows how we yearn to see -- or at least , to experience vicariously -- success . Yet Yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends . In the end , we see that Jake 's triumph does n't lie in commissions , or even in the esteem of his family , but in " the work " he could n't abandon if he tried.<br /><br />It 's an essential theme in a world ( and especially a movie industry ) that ca n't rise above " the bottom line " . This film deserves a wide audience .
1 What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars ? ANSWER : TOO MANY ! This movie is n't like that . It is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable.<br /><br />Downside:<br /><br />Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind.<br /><br />Upside:<br /><br />Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives.<br /><br />Well acted by : Scott Cohen , Judd Hirsch , Susan Floyd , Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte.<br /><br />Contains some good lighthearted humor .
1 One of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly . I suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters . The premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families / siblings go through in life . The complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting . Also , although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to ( i.e. Jewish / twins / family business ) the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it . That made it very engaging .
1 I saw Brother 's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it ! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son . The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn . He shows up there because his brother has died , and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother 's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family . The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives . Also , the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait .
1 Kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama . The curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team . The audience member can not but help but to feel that ( s)he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal . The viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself , though her predictions are rarely validated.<br /><br />Credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting . The wood - shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds , with its own traits , faults , a variety of highly charged relationships , and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals.<br /><br />Make sure to catch this one at your local art - house .
1 Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late ' 60s satire . Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler ( we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor 's tax return ) who , sensing that the future is in computers , poses ( by means of a deft piece of identity theft ) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinational.<br /><br />Ustinov ( who co - wrote the script ) is on top form , as is the delightful Maggie Smith , here unusually cast as an accident - prone cockney - sparrow dolly bird . Bob Newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith . In addition , Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as Ustinov and Newhart 's womanising boss.<br /><br />What do I particularly like about this film ? Not only is it a well - thought - out ' caper movie ' but it 's also a touching little love story ; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love ( the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective.)<br /><br />So , what is there not to like ? Well , the script is no more computer - literate than most films ( that is , hardly at all ) even though it captures the feel of late ' 60s ' big iron ' business computing quite well . Also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you 're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing , but I consider these to be minor niggles.<br /><br />As I said , this is a film which is well worth seeking out , and after you 've seen it once you 'll want to see it again at regular intervals.<br /><br / >
1 If there were two more charming performers than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 , I do n't know who they were . I first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 , and I consider any year in which I have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one . It 's intelligent , quirky , neat , wistful , sweet , gently subversive , and utterly enchanting . The romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving - never more so than in Maggie Smith 's desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck , a scene that 's both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness . And that final freeze - frame on the anxious , concerned , loving face of Ustinov as he asks , " Are you all right ? " - has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest ? I would never want to know anyone well who did n't love this movie .
1 This movie is now appearing on digital TV at least once a month , I 've watched it a dozen or more times , and it never ceases to delight me . If it was on tomorrow I 'd watch it again . Such is the artistry that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith , two great magicians of the acting profession can create , helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of Karl Malden , Bob Newhart and Robert Morley . Not forgetting others in minor roles.<br /><br />It is a simple tale , simply told , of an ex - con , a lovable embezzler , battling and succeeding with the then " new age technology " i.e computers , and finding affection in the process . Even if it is a tad ( tongue in cheek ) implausible , even unbelievable , the characters are not . There is no violence , no sex , no bad language , and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today . A real lesson to modern movie - makers on how to make a great show from , and with , virtually nothing ... except outstanding talent .
1 I recently found this movie on VHS after looking for it for a number of years , I was not disappointed . It gets better every time I see it . Peter Ustinov stars and co - wrote the original screenplay ( nominated for an Academy Award ) . Other stars you 've heard of include Karl Malden , Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero . Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler , just released from England 's infamous Wormwood Scrubs prison ( he had embezzled from the Conservative Party headquarters , selected because he is a Liberal ) . He immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle , and discovers that computers are the wave of the future . He social - engineers his way into a London men 's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town , he steals the identity of one Caesar Smith , who has just left town for South America to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild . He talks his way into Ta - Can - Co , an American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper ( Karl Malden ) . Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center , especially its security feature consisting of a flashing blue light . Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells , him , " Disconnect blue light . " Using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future , Ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies . The scheme starts to unravel when Klemper 's assistant Willard G. Gnatpole ( Bob Newhart ) notices the amount of business Ta - Can - Co appears to be transacting with Ustinov 's scam companies . With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger ( Maggie Smith ) , Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after . To tell you how would spoil this very funny , romantic , intelligent , and ahead - of - its - time picture .
1 It 's very sly for all of the 60 's look to the movie . The humor is quite gentle , but it grew on me much more than I expected . The cast is first - rate and they appear to be having a wonderful time . Ustinov wanders through the film muttering some quite funny things under his breath , and it 's all very inconsequential ; I 'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD . The plot is that Ustinov as an embezzler released from prison posing as a computer whiz and embezzling money from an American company with an office in London . Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while , and watching her get fired from many different jobs is part of the fun . Bob Newhart is his usual deadpan self , and Karl Malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive running the London office . The ending is funny and nicely cynical .
1 I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me . I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime . Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov plays the " retro hacker " perfectly . " O Nolo Mio " ! ! ! ! !
1 " Hot Millions " is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the marvelous cast assembled for it . The movie is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov , who wrote the screen play and appears as the key figure of an enterprising embezzler . The movie , directed by Eric Till , does n't show signs of having dated as terribly , as some others from that period.<br /><br />At the center of the action is a friendly man , Marcus Pendleton , who , before being released from prison , fixes the income tax forms for the warden , who is amazed of the refund he is owed by the government . Marcus , who is a genius at numbers , sees opportunities where others would n't . He starts working for a firm that uses the latest computer for its accounting , but Pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different phony accounts in different parts of the continent.<br /><br />Marcus is assigned a secretary , who also happens to have a flat in his building . The inept Patty is seen working as a bus fare taker who manages to make a mess of everything . How she lands a job as a secretary is beyond comprehension , but things are never the same in the office when the creepy Willard Gnatpole decides to go after her , but have no fear , Patty 's heart belongs to Marcus , who is an accomplished pianist and she is a flutist and they make beautiful music together.<br /><br />The best thing in the film is Peter Ustinov . He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and runs away with the film . Mr. Ustinov gives an assured account of the embezzler . The excellent Maggie Smith is also at her best with her take on Patty , the kind woman who adores Marcus and who proves to be a genius herself when it comes to investing the money she finds in Marcus ' pockets.<br /><br />Karl Malden is perfect as the American in charge of the corporation . Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole , the man who desires Patty , but ca n't get her to reciprocate . The marvelous Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith , whose identity Marcus has assumed . Cesar Romero appears also in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector.<br /><br />"Hot Millions " will delight everyone looking for a fun time in the company of that unsavory , but charming character , Marcus Pendleton .
1 I saw the description of the movie on TCM and only let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith , so I was delightfully surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional . Of course , it is seriously dated , but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago . Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often . I also was quite taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the leads , and of Karl Malden , Bob Newhart , and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero .
1 I just saw Hot Millions on TCM and I had completely forgotten this gem . Ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious ... Well you 'll see . Maggie Smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary / neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture . She creates a fine portrayal of a warm , witty and real person who in the long run ... well ... <br /><br />Molden and Newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own . < br /><br />Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know at least in Romero 's case Ustinov is extending a helping hand of work . < br /><br />This film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it 's problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost ... I say almost.<br /><br />Let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly , forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture .
1 I can only echo the praise of the other reviews here . It 's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality . Naturally sweet - no added sugar.<br /><br />One small point : it seems to me that the mild objections raised about Ustinov 's character Pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant at this sort of thing . Yes , the film was pretty computer illiterate , but it did show Pendelton ' studying computers ' at his flat , and I believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject , practically overnight.<br /><br />There were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton 's knowledge and call his bluff . I 'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that Pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations , or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear.<br /><br />Certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts . Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days , and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at , it 's necessary to know quite what their concept was . They knew there was something about ' procedures ' which was important ; they thought that the ' smart light ' could actually control security , rather than just indicate its state ; they thought that the ( dumb ) user terminal 's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though apart from things like graphics feature I do n't see it meself.<br /><br />Mostly , I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could , and they did that rather well . Allowing them a bit of artistic license , I do n't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note.<br /><br />CD
1 " Hot Millions " is a well - written , well - acted tale about an embezzler who steals ( whoops ! -- too low class a word for an embezzler , according to Peter Ustinov 's lead character ) a " hot million " from the London branch of a U.S. corporation by creating shell corporations on the continent and using the firm 's ostensibly secure computer to transfer funds to them . ( Remember , spoiler police , this is a comedy , not a mystery . ) < br /><br />From 1968 , this movie 's depiction of computers may seem naive to today 's more computer - literate populace ; but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released , I would assert that even then , this smacks of having been written by and for computer illiterates , probably on purpose to heighten the droll comedic aspects of this British flick . < br /><br />If one has little taste for this type of entertainment , the movie may seem to drag in spots . Fortunately , it has a nicely wrapped - up ending ; unfortunately , the end credits give no indication of the classical music used therein -- the symphonic piece at the end and the piano - flute duet in the middle -- just the song sung by Lulu which I totally do n't remember .
1 Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith , this could easily have been a turkey . But they are brilliant . Ustinov is at his best , and for fans of Maggie , it is great to see her in her early days , matching Ustinov every step of the way for with and timing . For Englishmen in their fifties ( and I am in that bracket ) , it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the Swinging Sixties , and although this film spends a lot of time in offices , it has plenty of Sixties nostalgia , including red buses , Carnaby Street , a song by Lulu and a delicious shot up the micro - skirt of a waitress , the like of which England has never seen since in public places . As an I.T. engineer , I know that the computer hacking tricks are laughable , but they are not meant to be taken seriously . Nor are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians , French and Germans .
1 Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in " Hot Millions , " a funny , quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden , Robert Morley , and Bob Newhart . Ustinov is an ex - con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer ( Morley ) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind . It 's not smooth sailing ; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company , played by Newhart , and his neighbor , Maggie Smith ( who knows him at their place of residence under another name ) , becomes his secretary for a brief period . She ca n't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired . When Newhart makes advances to her , she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover - up , but the two soon decide they 're made for each other . Of course , she does n't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a good movie - you ca n't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov 's machinations , his genius , and the ways he slithers out of trouble . But there 's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains . Do n't miss this movie , set in ' 60s London . It 's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine , " I 've been sacked . "
1 Hot Millions is a great movie in every way . A fun , offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business . Peter Ustinov is brilliant , as usual , and Maggie Smith --- definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time--- is a total delight . Karl Malden and Bob Newhart round out the cast and are also perfect . If you want a movie that has perfect casting , this is it . What is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way , creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout . Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances . The direction , photography , and editing are also first - rate , and it 's a great time capsule of London in the ' 60s . It 's definitely on my all - time favorites list .
1 A clever , undeniably entertaining romp starring Peter Ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a US conglomerate in London . He 's abetted by foxy ( and deceptively sharp ) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man Bob Newhart . This is a heist film with a lot of brains . Ustinov is exceptional as is Smith and Newhart is quite funny . The real surprise is Karl Malden , as the pill popping " executive vice - president . " Malden has seldom been so loose . Cesar Romero and Robert Morley pop up in some funny cameos . The excellent music score is by Laurie Johnson . Eric Till 's direction is brisk and the script by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first - rate & very smart . A swinging good time !
1 Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins . As soon as he walks out the gates , he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing , though this time he has his sights set pretty high . This is actually one of the weak points about the film , as he apparently knows nothing about computers ( few did back in 1968 ) but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight ! Yeah , right . Anyway , he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large American corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash . Considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary , it 's amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan AND manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses . But , it 's a movie after all , so I was able to suspend disbelief . By the end of the film , he and his new wife ( Maggie Smith ) are able to run away with a million pounds.<br /><br />At the very end , though , it gets very , very confusing and Smith announces she 's managed to actually accumulate more than two million by shrewd investing in the companies that Ustinov started ( though she did n't realize they were all dummy companies ) . This should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless . What they seem to imply ( and I could be guessing wrong here ) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stocks before this became known and the stocks would thereby then become worthless . Either way , the film seems to post on a magical ending whereby no one is hurt and everyone is happy -- and this just did n't make much sense . It 's a shame , really , as the acting and most of the writing was great . Karl Malden , Bob Newhart , Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just wonderful.<br /><br />If I seem to have interpreted the end , let me know , as the film seemed very vague in details at the end .
1 It 's about an embezzler , Peter Ustinov , who infiltrates a British company , Texa - Conn or something like that , posing as a computer whiz and security expert . He secretly learns to hack into the computer , while gathering the admiration of his boss , Karl Malden , the enmity of his office rival , Bob Newhart , and the love of his inept secretary , Maggie Smith.<br /><br />Some of the business details were a little murky to these non - business - oriented eyes but they 're believable enough and I got the general idea . Ustinov , the peculating Peter , establishes phony businesses in Paris , Rome , and Stuttgart , and uses Texa - Conn 's computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments . The overseas companies , of course , consist of nothing more than himself , Ustinov , and the addresses are an abandoned artist 's loft in Paris , a barber shop in Rome , and a bakery in Germany . He simply visits them to collect the checks he 's sent himself.<br /><br />I did n't think I 'd like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side . I was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage , along the lines of " The Pink Panther " or " The Lavender Hill Gang . " But this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot , the characterizations , and the dialog.<br /><br />Probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable.<br /><br />Ustinov to Secretary Smith : " Let me have the assets of these companies . " Smith : " Assets ? What are they ? " Ustinov : " Little female donkeys . " Now , nothing is made of this little exchange . There 's a quick cut and no delay for any laughter , which is appropriate because one 's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh.<br /><br />Ustinov searches out that crummy loft in Paris . It 's covered with cobwebs . Bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupant 's paintings have been left behind . The landlord does n't speak English and Ustinov knows no French . Ustinov points to a child - like painting of a nude woman and chuckles , " Ah . A fam fye - tal , eh ? " Landlord chuckles too , replies : " Vous le prenez pour une anee ? " Ustinov : " Oh -- ANNIE , so that 's her name ! " Landlord : " Oui ? " Ustinov : " Entente cordiale ! " ( Mes amis , if I got those genders wrong , je m'excuse . ) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole ( ! ) has the hots for Maggie Smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he 's taking " the scenic route . " There is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs . " Caution . " " Lay - By . " " Give Way . " " Yield . " Ending with the imperious " STOP / CHILDREN . " There 's another montage when Ustinov 's scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors -- blurry rooftops , police cars , a farewell embrace from Maggie , ending with a sign : PRISON , Wormwood Scrubs.<br /><br />Well , maybe one more . I still ca n't get over Malden as the boss , declaring decisively , " I never agonize over decisions , " then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water.<br /><br />The acting is unarguably fine . It 's Bob Newhart 's best role , for instance . Not that he had that many , and not that his range was n't limited , but he 's perfect in this part . The musical score by Laurie Johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it . She seems to have written a brief concerto for flute . Ustinov 's passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini . Stuttgart 's phony president is somebody named Schmidt , and he 's an anomalous clinker . Maggi Smith is pretty , sexy , bourgeois , and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems.<br /><br />Delightful , in its own quiet way , but do n't expect comic fireworks .
1 This is a rip - roaring British comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired . Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception , particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan . Karl Malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in ' Streets of San Francisco ' . I believe that Maggie Smith is the real star of this film though , appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on , particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes . One thing does concern me though , could someone please tell me why i can not purchase this on either DVD or VHS format in the UK , could someone please assist ?
1 I think this movie is well done and realistic . I you are used to watching Hollywood " action " movies , and use that as a standard to rate this movie , you are bound to be disappointed . This movie is much closer to real life than 95 % of what Hollywood can produce , and that is what lifts it above the average action movie . I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever , and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act . But as i have seen the " making of " extra I 'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes . This is a movie i will recommend for others to watch . High quality realistic story and movie .
1 I did not set very high expectations for this movie , which left me pleasantly surprised . The story is a little strange sometimes but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility . The action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to US movies . This may not be the best movie ever but it 's uncommon for Sweden and I hope to see more similar ones in the future .
1 As an employee of the Swedish Air Force I enjoyed the nice Gripen and Hkp 9 ( MBB Bo 105 ) flight scenes in this movie . One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod , in this case an inert Rb 75 ( Maverick ) missile painted black with the letters " EWS 39 " in white along the side . Real jammer pods definitely do not look like that , at least not the ones I 've seen.<br /><br />But apart from that , it 's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending ( the last minute ) . Anyone interested in seeing various Swedish military units , including the now - legendary SSG , on film should see this one.<br /><br / >
1 This first installment of Crispin Glover 's personal magnum opus asks you to think a little , and so ca n't be recommended for any viewer who does n't want to sit and puzzle over Glover 's imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative . To the more casual viewer , yes , it 's probably going to come off as a confusing mish - mash of odd , startling , and disturbing imagery for imagery 's sake . < br /><br />You get the sense that Glover does n't mind that this is the case , and he 'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it . Glover 's innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself , but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings ; he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented.<br /><br />The easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as Dada or nihilist , a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who 's worked both without and within . But there 's a reason why Glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie , and it 's not only to sell books ; his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that Glover pieced together , and What Is It ? does similarly with imagery drawn from Western culture . < br /><br />What Is It ? is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing . Much has already been made about Glover 's use of actors with Down 's syndrome , and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film . So jarring , in fact , that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far - reaching crusade to see a more realistic and/or dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor , on the absolute other end of the spectrum , as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled . But it 's not either , and maybe that 's part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many : the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred , but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness . It 's not a film about Down 's syndrome , but it is a film that is owned by the actors with Down 's syndrome who appear in it.<br /><br />I'm the sort of person who is entirely gung - ho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful ; happily for me , this is pretty much exactly how What Is It ? presents itself to viewers . Glover uses the strange images of snails , death , and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail . In some ways , the weirdly compelling ( and occasionally downright grotesque ) elements of What Is It ? remind me of the work of the painter Francis Bacon   he of the infamous popes , yes , and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away . Like Bacon 's paintings , Glover 's film manages to be opulent and humble , grainy and polished , chaotic and well - realized   and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting . But still this is not an entirely serious film , and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that , for the most part , derives from the use ( and juxtaposition ) of familiar items , images , and names of popular culture . And when What Is It ? is funny , it is very funny.<br /><br />Overall , What Is It ? is an impressive first film from Glover as a director and writer , and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be . Watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that is n't exactly good or bad , but just strange   and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up . If that 's the kind of art you enjoy , What Is It ? is likely to exceed your expectations and be well - worth the effort of catching it in the theatre , along with The Big Slide Show and Glover himself . All in all , it 's an experience you 're unlikely to forget any time soon .
1 Hilarious , evocative , confusing , brilliant film . Reminds me of Bunuel 's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky 's Holy Mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for ..... what is it ? I laughed almost the whole way through , all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre . Entertaining through and through , from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end , if it was an end . I only wish i could remember every detail . It haunts me sometimes.<br /><br />Honestly , though , i have only the most positive recollections of this film . As it does n't seem to be available to take home and watch , i suppose i 'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes my way again with his Big Slide Show ( and subsequent " What is it ? " screening ) ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash , so i was slightly dazed at the time , which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike Glover in his appropriate burly - Q setting , scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent DADAist wet dream.<br /><br />Is it a statement on Life As We Know It ? Of course everyone EXPECTS art to be just that . I rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space . What you do n't tell us is what we must deduce , but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out . Rather one " WHAT IS IT ? " than 5000 movies like " Titanic " or " Sleepless in Seattle " ( shudder , gag , groan).<br /><br />Thank you , Mr. Glover ( additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his Big Slide Show-- smart , funny , quirky , and outrageously hot ) . Make more films , write more books , keep the nightmare alive .
1 It takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched , beguiling , disgusting and repulsive , but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation . Crispin Glover , in all of his " out there " antics and predispositions , truly made something that is unique . In a world that has become starkly partisan , this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone . < br /><br />Right off the bat , the film takes on a rather distant paradigm ( if there really is a model at all ) and initially shapes it with the likes of Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy . It 's rather shocking stuff , but if you had the opportunity for the Q&A sessions after the screenings , it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator . In either guise , you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause . It will never be accepted , not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition . You may not like it , but it is certainly something worth watching .
1 I did n't know what to make of this film . I guess that is what it was all about really . I have never seen a film like it and I doubt that I really ever will again . Glover puts together something that is unique to him . I think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poetry , maybe see one of his slide shows . I really like this guy , he is just so bizarre I ca n't help it . Note : I saw this film before it was through its final editing , so maybe what I have seen and what others have seen are different . I will know , I guess , if I choose to view the film again . I think I will have to be properly drug influenced ...
1 This film is very interesting . I have seen it twice and it seems Glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish . I for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center , and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not " think " about due to corporate media control . The outrage that Glover expresses through the " outrageous " elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency . I am glad I saw this film and it is even clearer that Glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy . It is fine ! EVERYTHING IS FINE . See that also . People that dismiss this film as " thoughtless " or " pretentious " are really missing the boat . This is an intelligent films . If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books , that is also very wroth while . The way you get in to his mindset is really something . You will have an experience !
1 Flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.<br /><br />This flick exposes all the clichés , and then some ! Excruciatingly bad ( Downs - Syndrome ! ) actors . Terribly heavy self important dialog . Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat . Jarring editing . Pointless plot points . All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych - drivel.<br /><br />It achieves exactly what it was designed to . A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust - funders , to show to their parents when they ask them what they 've been doing for the last two years ! After " What Is It ? " received its Cannes award , presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof , in part of his own films ! He supposedly blew up at the info . To this day he refuses to discuss the incident.<br /><br />Anyway , see it and laugh , this will be a classic of humor for many years to come .
1 I am currently on vacation in Israel for summer , and so was able to see this incredible film . A bit of a warning before I begin writing : I speak fluent Hebrew , and so the Hebrew parts were no problem ; however , about a quarter ( a bit less ) of the film is in Arabic , and I was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit . This did not detract from my understanding of the film , but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater.<br /><br />After a year of American Cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships , it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest ; yet , " The Bubble " surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting , witty dialogue , and relevant political climate.<br /><br />The film opens on a checkpoint on the Israeli - Palestinian border ; For the first few moments , we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on . Yet , this is an important element of this film 's strength . The political situation , and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background . Most importantly , Tel Aviv serves as a character of its own in this film . It is constantly referenced . Street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged . The skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly , and ultimately the city evolves along with the film The film focuses on the love between Noam ( Ohad Knoller ) and a Palestinian immigrant , Ashraf(Yousef ' Joe ' Sweid ) , with the societies of Tel Aviv and Palestine serving as a constant foil . We always know that their relationship is forbidden , and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema . The love is incredibly strong , and stands as the centerpiece of the film . The secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong : flamboyant restaurant owner Yelli 's ( Yousef ' Joe ' Sweid ) relationship with the ultra - butch and grating golani solider , Golan ( Zohar Liba ) , is particularly a source of amusement . The love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite , fine crafted works of art , and the cinematography is astounding : In the first love scene of the film , the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to Lulu ( Daniela Virtzer ) , and dissolves into a shot of Noam and Ashraf . This shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love.<br /><br />To give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy , but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate , so I will instead focus on the witty dialogue . Even when watching this movie in my second language , I could not stop laughing throughout . Lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven , and an analogy of Sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber . This dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in Cinema . The music used in the film is also particularly powerful . Music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it , and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other . Little elements like this truly elevate the film.<br /><br />I could not give greater recommendation to a film ; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted .
1 The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . It 's obvious he has n't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well - meaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . If only it was that easy . But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . Well , if you 're not part of the solution , you 're part of the problem.<br /><br />The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever - expanding bloodbath . Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation . Where does it end ? And apparently he missed the significance of " the bubble " referred to in the name , which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . ( He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he was n't paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . ) < br /><br />I found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star - crossed lovers , to update the Romeo & Juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . Let 's be honest here : Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female ( young love wins all hearts ) -- but when people 's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them HATE each other , then the conclusion is inevitable .
1 Eytan Fox did it again : move the viewer 's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess . The movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is Tel Aviv.<br /><br />I was there a month ago and it is all there : the lifestyle , the relationships , the heart - beating city , the mess , the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light - hearted , blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever.<br /><br />Strongly recommend : it is a voyage for the heart and the mind , with an interesting perspective to the Israelo - Palestinian conflict.<br /><br />Nota Bene : There is central gay plot in the movie . If you do not think you are too gay - friendly , be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as " just love " . ( and do n't worry : the chick is hot too ! )
1 It 's one of the best movies I 've seen in the last 2 years ( I 've seen the premier in Tel - Aviv , Israel in the summer of 2006 , exactly when the last war has began ... ) This problem in communication between the people , that causes wars , is interesting me for a long time , and it does n't matter who- boys and girls , straight and gays , Jews and Arabs ... I 've seen the Bubble already 3 times , and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know , and the difference between them , like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time i saw it- was with my friend , who is a Christian Arab , and it was on the independence day of Israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic ) and ... he cried in the end ! ! ! - if he 's been touched and was n't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by The Bubble !
1 I got this one a few weeks ago and love it ! It 's modern , light but filled with true complexities of life . It questions and answers , just like other Eytan Fox movies . This is my favorite , along with Jossi & Jagger . This pictures a lot more , universally , than only the bubbles we may live in . You do n't need to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - I 'm not , but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies . At first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further . Relationships we have to live with are superficial , meaningful , deep , fatal , you name it . You do n't know what 's coming , and you definitely do n't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time . It is worth seeing several times . Fox movies include great bonus material - here a great music video and " the making of " ( including explanation of the title , interviewing Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and Arabs with doubts about the Israeli life styles ) .
1 I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer . my Hebrew is not fluent , so the subtitles were very useful , I did n't feel lost at any point in the movie . You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes.<br /><br />This movie blew me away ! ! ! ! ! ! It depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today : A homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian . It allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously . The dilemma , the emotions entailed . The movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side ! an absolute must see ! !
1 The Israeli / Palestinian conflict persists and while the world may be aware of the violence surrounding the division of the two countries , few have a clue to the other aspect of the division - the group of people who want peace and work toward eradicating the separation . Eytan Fox , in THE BUBBLE ( ' Ha - Buah ' ) , has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the schism , electing to tell a story that contains some fine humor , a lot of love , and a taste of brutal reality . It is a window into a situation that begs for understanding.<br /><br />In Tel Aviv three close friends are roommates : Lulu ( Daniela Virtzer ) , a beautiful young woman with strong opinions ; Yali ( Alon Friedman ) , a very ' out ' gay young man who works in a popular café ; and Noam ( Ohad Knoller ) , a handsome , somewhat shy fellow who , in addition to his day job in a music shop , is a member of the National Guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city 's checkpoints . It is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young Palestinian named Ashraf ( Yousef ' Joe ' Sweid ) , and a mutual attraction occurs . The three friends decide to ' stowaway ' the illegally present Ashraf ( whom they nickname with an Israeli name ) and while Ashraf and Noam settle into a love relationship , Yali hires Ashraf at his café , and Yali and Lulu both proceed to find love interests , too . All goes well until Ashraf must return home for his sister 's wedding . Though in Tel Aviv Ashraf has been able to be openly gay with Noam , life is far different in Jerusalem : Ashraf is told he must marry his sister 's groom - to - be sister . In an attempt to rescue Ashraf from his fate , Noam and Lulu disguise themselves as French reporters to gain access to Ashraf . In a moment of supposed seclusion , Noam and Ashraf are discovered kissing by the groom - to - be , and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for Ashraf to remain ' in the closet'.<br /><br />While the young people in Tel Aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence , an attack occurs in Jerusalem - one that has grave consequences not only immediately , but also in the revenge mission Ashraf must now assume . The ending is tragic on many levels and it underlines just how serious the problem between these two countries is.<br /><br />The acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people . The story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes Eytan Fox such a fine writer / director . More people should watch this important and very fine film . In Hebrew , Arabic , and English with subtitles . Grady Harp
1 Since the advent of literature , people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love . Even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love , love that can not be . The Israeli filmmaker Eytan Fox ' latest film The Bubble " is about that . And then it is also not . The title of the film refers to the bubble " that is Tel - Aviv set against the background of the political realities of Israel . The country 's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city does n't have much in common with Nablus , a city in the Palestinian West Bank which also features in the film . It does n't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the Palestinian checkpoints . Actually , it does n't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it . The bubble " of Tel - Aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which is n't much different from what you may expect in any Western city . Teenage girls looking for Britney Spears ' records , a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue , trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks , while those at home are watching the local edition of Pop Idol . It is this bubble " that also has the potential to lull one 's mind into a false sense of reality.<br /><br />The film evolves around the lives of three young Israelis who share a flat and , for the most part , try to stay out of politics . Yelli , the camp owner and manager of Orna & Ella " , a hip cafe , rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the crap that surrounds them " . Noam , a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store , seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations . Lulu , the only female of the lot , is on the contrary linked to the Israeli Left , although her political activities seem to be confined to raves against the occupation " . Yelli and Noam naturally do n't object to participating in these . Lulu and her political friends make t - shirts with the rave 's logo , put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood . Their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual Palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again . The closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so Palestinian - friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets . In other words , predictable products of the bubble".<br /><br />The opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to Nablus where we also find Noam doing his reserve duty . A group of Palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering Israel , among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from Noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance . The woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on Noam 's doorstep in Tel - Aviv with his ID which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border . His name is Ashraf , he 's Palestinian and he 's gay . And he has n't just come to hand back the ID , he has come to see Noam . Without a permit to live in Israel and despite the initial hesitation from Noam 's flatmates he stays . He soon gets a Jewish name and a job at Yelli 's cafe . Having grown up in Jerusalem with Hebrew , he does n't have an Arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity . The sky is light blue and the air is sweet . But it can not last . For he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be.<br /><br />At one point , Noam and Ashraf watch a play called Bent about two prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards . They find a way of being together on another level , a metaphysical one , a level where no one else has access . This is also where our couple arrives in the end . And it could n't have been much different for them , not in today 's Israel.<br /><br />The Bubble " is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today 's Israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an Israeli and a Palestinian , the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist . The Bubble " is also a beautiful film about people , gay and straight , inhabiting that strange city , Tel - Aviv , shown through the eyes of people who really care about them . The film 's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed , but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched .
1 It 's difficult to not have a liking for Israeli director Eytan Fox and for his movies , which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions . Besides he also gave voice to the young generations , and to the remarkable part of them , who really need PEACE and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people , both in Israel both in Palestine . These reasons , in my opinion , are sufficient to consider Fox a noteworthy director , even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control . However the fans of his movies ( that he realized on team with Gal Uchovsky , his producer , co - screenwriter and also life companion ) seem to not being vexed by this , since his new feature , THE BUBBLE ( HA - BUAH ) , is having the same success of the previous YOSSI & JAGGER and WALK ON THE WATER . Announced as a contemporary gay version of " Romeo & Juliet " , set in the present day Tel Aviv instead of Verona and with two men ( one Israeli and the other Palestinian ) at the place of the two Shakespearean young lovers , the film actually is quite different from that or , better , it 's also something else . In fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man , Noam , played by the Fox regular Ohad Knoller ( Yossi in YOSSI & JAGGER , but I must confess I miss Jagger , the astonishing Yehuda Levi ! ) and his two co - tenants , a guy and a girl , chose to live . Around thirty - years - old , restless , witty and firm ( despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the Palestine ) to live a life that wo n't be only made of war . The two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other . Their lives are destined to change when Noam falls in love with Ashraf ( the TV star Yousef ' Joe ' Sweid ) a young Palestinian who came to live in Tel Aviv . The laws so far in force among the group are neglected , but not the will to aid one friend . Still it wo n't be easy for Noam and his friends , 'cause Ashraf is clandestine in Israel and in the meantime his family , who lives in Palestine and does n't know he 's gay , is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl , who is a relative of Ashraf 's beloved sister bridegroom - to - be , who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot , with consequences not just for the two men . Because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace ( interesting dualism , if not automatic ) are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable . Even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between Noam and Ashraf meets with , it does n't the overlook the other characters , which turn out well written ( for example Golan , the boyfriend of Yelli , Noam 's fellow tenant , introduced as a lively boor , and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person ) and aptly performed ( besides the two leads , we must n't disregard the funny Zohar Liba and the lovely Daniela Virtzer , the girl of the gang ; moreover LATE MARRIAGE 's star Lior Ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo ) . It also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones , even if the director ca n't do without a melodramatic conclusion . I watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime I often thought about it , proof that Fox and his pal have a knack to strike home .
1 This film is a complete re - imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus . The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus . There is a border between them , and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs . The situation is bleak enough . We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap . But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay , Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus . To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv . It is off limits in Nablus . The conflict between the two peoples , the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures , two ethics . But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension . Ashraf 's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus . Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay . She can not accept it but accepts to speak about it later . From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack . It takes place in a café in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam 's is severely wounded . Bad enough . The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack , but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street . The funeral follows the wedding . The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack . Ashraf volunteers to take his place . The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister . He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam 's . But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him . Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street . The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death . We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona , a neutral character that can impose peace , or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel . The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides . But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film , a play that shows love in Auschwitz , between two prisoners , one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle . This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking : gay love in Auschwitz . What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible . The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that can not but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on . We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago . Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated . This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution . But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations . So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden , of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on : so let 's procreate more and more little soldiers . But love is just an extra - terrestrial concept.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
1 Here 's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox . The movie presents the story of star - crossed lovers ( one Israeli , one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv . The film 's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross - ethnic conflict , but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well . For example , there 's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters , openly gay , is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family , and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room . Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems , and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be , while the boyfriend is confused and rejected . A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment . As we know from Yossi & Jagger , Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences . The film is also effective for the even - handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelies and Palestinians inflict on each other . If you 're not heartless , you 'll cry through the last third of the movie . Though the plot is melodramatic , it 's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be .
1 Directed and co - written by Eytan Fox the writer / director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature " Yossi & Jagger " ( 2002 ) . This comparative epic , at 1hr 53 minutes , is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life . Westerners , especially urban gay men like myself , need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity.<br /><br />While " Yossi & Jagger " focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of Israeli military service , " Ha Buah " is centred on a group of civilian friends , both straight and gay , who share a unit in the heart of Israel 's generally gay - tolerant , but not always gay - friendly , capital Tel Aviv.<br /><br />"Ha Buah " opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which Noam ( Ohad Knoller  Yossi from " Yossi & Jagger " ) first meets handsome young Arab Ashraf ( Yousef Sweid ) . Romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether.<br /><br />From there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of Ashraf 's very conservative family . If you follow this film 's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />The soundtrack for " Ha Buah " is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i.e. real life in the Middle East.<br /><br />The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best .
1 Movies like this one , and C.R.A.Z.Y. , make me very sad for American films with a gay subject matter . With the exception of Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain , there are few other notable American films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie , The Bubble . This movie centers on two men , Noam and Ashwar , an Israle and Palestinian respectively . Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel . Couples , in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next , or who will say " I love you " first . Noam and Ashwar 's early love is complicated by suicide bombings , armed security check points , and racism . While Noam 's friends accept and like Ashwar , who is Arab , it is clear that most of Tel Aviv 's citizens probably don't.<br /><br />One of the most touching moments , and there are many in this film , is when Noam and Ashwar attend a production of " Bent " . We , as movie goers , see them watching this play , and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes . And ultimately , this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller and Youseff ' Joe ' Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar . Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet . And while most movies today have sex in them , ( almost as a sport ) , this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined . It is so refreshing . Also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons . There are cartoonish characters in this movie . It just does n't happen to be the two gay guys for a change . Somewhere on this site I think I read a comparison between this movie and " Friends " . Well , not really . Yes , these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships . But I do n't recall getting " blowed up " as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in " Friends".<br /><br />This is a very good movie . It has heart , and heartbreak . And like all good love stories love does win out . But not in it 's intact glory of full bloom . Still , it 's a very satisfying movie to watch .
1 This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen . The fantastic actor , Lior Ashkenazi , who starred in Walk on Water , has a minor role in this film also.<br /><br />But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam ( Ohad Knoller ) , Lulu ( Daniela Virtzer ) , and Yelli ( Alon Friedman ) ; and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf ( Yousef ' Joe ' Sweid ) . There is sort of a Friends / Sex in the City thing going on ( mostly gay ) , and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.<br /><br />But , that 's the rub . No matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have , the war is not going to end . Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table , but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason . There are many on the Israeli side , both there and here in the US , who just want it all and will not consider peace . There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come . It is in no one 's interest to end this war , and the children suffer.<br /><br />This is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film . It wo n't go away . You know something tragic is going to happen and , of course , it does . With the feelings on both sides running strong , and revenge as the motivator , tragedy always happens , and that is what makes this an adult version of Friends / Sex in the City . There is no superficiality . It is real life , and it was a beautiful thing to see .
1 My father was the warden of the prison ( he is retired now ) showcased in this documentary and I 've grown up around the prison life , so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie . I will say this , the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people . They were brave enough to A ) Show up and tell this story , B ) Get inside these inmates minds and hearts , and C ) Do all of this responsibly . Responsible to their art and , more importantly , responsible to the inmates and staff of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex . They should be commended without end for this work . To take 170 hours , yes HOURS , of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect.<br /><br />I saw this film under circumstances that only a very , very few were able to see it . I was at the inmate screening . I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen . I saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you , it was a very profound experience . These men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases , yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves , even if they view themselves as unredeemable . How many of us have the courage to do this ? How many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment ? To see them react to the film was an experience I am eternally grateful for , and I will never forget that . I thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives , I thank my father for making ALL of this possible , and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour their blood , sweat , soul , and tears into this project.<br /><br />This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life , and the inmates held within it . ' Oz ' is not real , television is not real . ' Shakespeare Behind Bars ' is .
1 One of the best parts of Sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss . Unless you 're a real art - house devotee , you probably do n't catch many documentaries . Only a handful get any recognizable distribution . Fortunately , Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years.<br /><br />Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange , Kentucky . Every year a group of inmates present a Shakespearean play . Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self - selected , interpreted , rehearsed and ultimately performed.<br /><br />The movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison environments . Despite the labels we know them by ( convict , felon , murderer , etc . ) we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings . Serendipitously , the play chosen for the year of filming was The Tempest , with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption . The actors all grapple with the relevance of the play to their lives , finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama.<br /><br />For a documentary film , like a book , the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives . Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation for me . " O brave new world , that has such creatures in it . "
1 If you 're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright William Shakespeare ? And if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes , you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals . In a Kentucky Correctional Prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results . This film shows how it was all done  .the casting  .the rehearsals  .the set and costumes  and the final presentation of Shakespeare 's play " The Tempest . " It had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison . In the play the ship - wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world . Prison life too is much like that.<br /><br />With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape , the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience , may be not quite as Shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure.<br /><br />More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character . One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins . It was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder , shooting and strangulation . One had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions . However ( as someone said ) the past was past , and the present was the beginning of a new future . At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events.<br /><br />The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place . Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example . It seems to me that everyone stands to benefit  not only the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole .
1 Shakespeare Behind Bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content . Convicts at Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange , Kentucky who have raped , murdered etc   and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become important , popular and celebrated in acting . There are paralleled themes to ' Shawshank Redemption ' with their institutionalised natures and search for forgives and redemption for their past lives . As we follow a generous , non judgemental Director , who gives up his time each year to Direct certain inmates in a chosen play by William Shakespeare ( this time around , the ' Tempest ' , that was cleverly portrayed with the inmates who could relate to it so much with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption in which they confide and relate to ) we are introduced to each actor in formal interviews that are nicely paced with break up footage of them rehearsing . Each actor has their own story and tell of their regrets and reasons why they are there in emotional fashion with melancholic music over each in a traditional documentary sense . The strongest and most respected inmate ( it would seem ) is Sammie . The Director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in Sammie ( and later , Hal ) and allows a longer , more in depth observation into the man and his personality . His presence is felt on screen and his personal revelations come as a shock to the audience , but give him such appeal in his emotional personality and a particular empathy is felt toward him . Hal is the same at the beginning of the film . He has other things that he does to pass the time that 's shown as a comfortable hobby as it were in running an on site news broadcast programme . Again , through personal interviews and revelations self admitted by Hal ( and nicely shot cutaways of Hal 's body language , not the close - ups of his uncertain hand movement not only observed with him but others as well , ) in particular his heart felt story about being unsure and scared of his true sexuality in a society that purely would not accept him as a homosexual until later on in the film where he is shown to be quite snide and rude to other inmates involved in the play as though he deems himself above all of them , in particular to Ron who already has a frustrating temperament in his acting . The relationship between all of the inmates involved in the play is shown as one of respect and unity to achieve something great for themselves . With nice ( if not clichéd ) motions of time passing by with titles etc   everything seems to go right in the first act , and then on the build up to the public performance , things predictably go wrong . An induction of one of the actors being transferred and his character being replaced by a younger , newer inmate gives the narrative a nice subplot into someone who promises big , but in the end disappoints all and does not live up to their expectation . One inmate in particular ( Big - G ) welcomes the new inmate actor ( Rick ) with an evident will to nurture him into their beloved practise and hopefully become a good role model . The film seems to capture each inmates passion so well with something the audience can relate to especially when Rick is put in the ' Hole ' for getting new tattoos ( something nicely hinted upon earlier in the film when the warden stops a random inmate in the yard and asks him when he got a tattoo that 's on his arm and we learn it 's a punishable offence in the facility ) and Big - G 's disappointment is understood deeply . A happy ending ? It all looks great when they are performing successfully ( even being invited to perform elsewhere ) and a sense of real unity echoes around them , but in the end , the film brings everyone back down to earth that this is short lived and everything they ever had or wanted was and will always be taken away from them . It is back to prison to pay for their crimes and no matter what redemption they seek in acting these plays , they wo n't be free men , their proud performances and recognition is undermined by the fact that they are the lowest of the low criminals and a nice halt in the uplifting music that plays in a shot of a long corridor that coincides with the lights turning off and doors shutting is a powerful image of their oppression . The Director seemed to be aware he was watching likable people in the documentary by given additional information at the end of the film into each actors future from the end of the film about where they are and what 's happening to them now .
1 Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and delightful film I 've seen all year . It 's about a prison program , somewhere in California if I recall correctly , where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years . The film follows their production of " The Tempest " from casting through performance , and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men , who are all in for the most serious of crimes . Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film , the audience would never buy it , but knowing that it 's real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally ; I gasped out loud when I learned of one particularly gifted felon 's crime . It 's like some loopy episode of Oz , and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real .
1 Believe it or not , Inspector Gadget 's Last Case is what got me hooked on the whole Gadget thing.<br /><br />My name is Miriam and I am twelve years old , so obviously I was n't around when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career . Sure , I 'd heard of him , but I did n't really know him.<br /><br />While reading , note that I NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL SERIES ( I would if it came on ! ) . This is just about the only Gadget thing I 've ever watched ( even though I am now obsessed ) and I will be focusing on what I liked about it since everyone else is so negative . For all you pessimists , I 've got some cons down there , too . = P First off , for a childish sense of humor , you could deem this movie pretty funny . I thought it was , so sue me . I also thought the animation and character designs were good , and I 'm also happy there was more Gadget in it , since he 's my favorite character . ( I do NOT like Penny . ) Then there was Claw ( his voice was awful , though ) and the Madcat ; I thought they were done fairly good too . Gadget 's idiocy seemed pretty well in place , if not a bit exaggerated ( i.e. sucking his hat - hand thing 's thumb . Would make a good screen shot , though . = P ) Oh , and I liked the song that ran in the credits . Yes , I am strange.<br /><br />And , like all movies , there are some negatives , too.<br /><br />Talking cars ? What 's up with that ? You can tell this was aimed at younger boys . That would n't bother me quite so much if there was n't the fact that the cars basically saved the day . I would have much preferred if Penny and Brain had taken their place . And , apparently , Gadget loved his car more than would be called natural . A bit weird , to say the least.<br /><br />Oh , and the Chief was downright mean to Gadget . I mean , sheesh , yeah , he was n't always the most cheerful of people , but he did n't HATE Gadget , from what I 've read . Like the Inspector , his personality was exaggerated.<br /><br />Well , that 's pretty much all I have to say about this movie . I thought the animation made up for the car - centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent ; more so than the live - action Gadget films ( butchered , butchered , BUTCHERED ! ) at least . Maybe I 'm just biased because this is what got me into Gadget in the first place , or maybe my mind is twisted , or maybe I 'm just odd , but I really liked this movie , even if I 'm the oldest it 's recommended for .
1 Despite its rather salacious title , this is a light teen dramedy . Unless you 're an old coot , you 'll probably find it likeable . It is n't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly , though . When you view it , you get the feeling that you 've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you 've been sitting down watching the whole time . This is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters , and they are appealing enough . Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many , I know , but I 've always liked the more obscure Maddie Corman . The teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown - ups . Is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike ?
1 I originally came across Linda Feferman 's Seven Minutes in Heaven when I was 14 and worked at a video store and I loved it . I recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure . The movie stars Jennifer Connelly , almost twenty years before she would go on to win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind , as Natalie Becker . Byron Thames plays her best friend in the world , Jeff Moran . The film is definitely a milder , cuter and softer version of the Pretty in Pink 's and Some Kind of Wonderful 's of the 1980 's , which is exactly why it is so good . It 's honest , not forced like those films , and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids.<br /><br />When Natalie 's Dad leave home on a business trip , Jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks . With support from Natalie 's friend , Polly , played exquisitely by Maddie Corman , she lets him . But this movie is n't about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with . The three leads are so natural and the script , surprisingly so honest , that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking . These characters really do care about each other . It 's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre - teen adolescence.<br /><br / >
1 Considering all the teen films like " the Breakfast Club " and " Pretty In Pink " that are lionized . It is surprising that this one is so ignored.<br /><br />There is no sex in it , but sex is thought of , including the idea that it may matter what others think about it . The kids do not always get along with their parents , but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong , and the parents are not seen as monsters.<br /><br />It deals with hero - worship . How one girl does a dangerous thing , which could have lead to real dustier , before realizing that she was wrong.<br /><br />The movie is kind of ahead of its ' time . One kid asks another kid what birth control she uses . She says she is doing nothing to need birth control . She replies ( wrongly ) " oral sex " .
1 This movie rocks " Jen sexy as ever and Polly wow were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of teens it needs to be put on DVD soon or it will become a classic . i Really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on Jen now i am too old but to this movie is made for all gens > you know i come from the early 80,s area were i Had to watch everyone els live the life i wanted but thru movies i can do that all over again i guess in short i am hoping and wishing that this movie not be lost in time but reborn to the youth so they may enjoy the heart warm filling you get learning about hormones and datting problems and how to get away with stuff that seems so major back then but do n't mean nothan now so this movie is a dating tool .
1 First off , I 'm a huge fan of 80s movies , and of Jennifer Conelly as well . So yesterday , I wandered into a local used book / movie store and found a VHS copy . I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 , it was a good deal . So I took it home and popped it in the VCR . What a sweet movie ! At my age now , I relate more to movies like About Last Night or St. Elmo 's Fire , but still I remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy , etc . We all have those little crushes when we 're younger . And if it does n't work out , we 're heartbroken and we think that we 'll never get over it . But of course we do . Many times . It 's that sort of sweet quality that I really got from this movie . The feeling of " Oooh ! I remember when something like that happened to me ... " is all through it . The characters are interesting and well - developed . I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies , teen films in particular , or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives .
1 I really enjoyed this movie . I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could relate . This will be a movie I would show my kids to let them know , the feelings they are having are normal . It is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age .. who knew that we would bounce back .... again and again .... Great movie ! ! ! !
1 I 've been a Jennifer Connelly fan since Phenomena , and after I heard about seven minutes in heaven , I saw it as soon as I could . The movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal I loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie ! ! ! !
1 The title of this film is taken from a party game called " Seven Minutes in Heaven . " The game was popular among my husband 's friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn , NY , and he describes it as something like " Spin - the - Bottle , " " Lifesaver Relay , " and other preteen kissing games . According to the rules , a boy 's name and a girl 's would be drawn , and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes . In the meantime , there would be speculation among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands , embrace , and/or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet . At the end of seven minutes , the game leader would say , " Time 's up " or knock on the closet door , and the couple would emerge from the closet . After being quizzed by the other guests , the couple would have to admit what they had done during their " Seven Minutes in Heaven . " Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated . The couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game.<br /><br />Such games have served as social " ice - breakers " for children and teens , but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy individuals . The film has been given this title because it deals with the teens ' first experiences with crushes and romantic love .
1 I think that people are under estimating this incredible film . People are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep . Which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have Stephanie beaton . This is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film.<br /><br />The general view on this movie is that it has bad acting , a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it ca nt be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this . But i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining .
1 This movie is ridiculous ! That 's exactly what I like about this piece of " Guilty Pleasure " . It is easy to condemn this movie for not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick , the original Marilyn and Eddie . But look at the year and do the math . Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had long outgrown their parts ! Time does that to young stars . Yvonne De Carlo , who re - prised her role as Lili , was pushing the Big 6 - 0 ( even though she still looked good and was still the perfect " Lili").<br /><br />It 's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo was n't given a larger part . Still , it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous ! During the 2 seasons that THE MUNSTERS was on prime time , it was the Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made the series such a success . The rest of the cast were supporting cast members , not to say that they were n't needed . They were ! The TV series would n't had survived as long as it did without them . Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman ( the original " Eddie " ) , the choice was too easy . Yvonne De Carlo was also the better choice over Joan Marshall.<br /><br />Though this movie does n't measure up to the original TV series , it still measures up nicely and is one of the better " reunuin " TV specials that plagued the boob - tube during the late 1970s / early 1980s.<br /><br / > '
1 This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen . For me , that 's what makes it so awesome ! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series . While there was less slapstick , they still worked wonderfully together " comedically . " I wish Yvonne De Carlo , as Lily , would have had more plot involvement . She showed that she could do comedy in the original series , but it was mostly wasted in this movie . This movie also stars the great Sid Caesar , but sadly he does n't have any interaction with Gwynne and Lewis . I think some better work could have come out of that .
1 Fred Gwynne , Al Lewis , Sid Caesar , and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny , funny movie . The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster ( Al Lewis ) , wife Lily ( Yvonne De Carlo ) , and his son and daughter . Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family . When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two . The two now have to clear their names before it 's too late . You 'll laugh out loud just like I did .
1 Version : Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release . Cantonese / English subtitles < br /><br />Once upon a time , five years ago , the world was obsessed with ' The Matrix ' , and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that ' Terminator ' was better than ' Matrix ' . I was but a simple teenage boy , looking for a good action movie , and then there was a shining light on a TV station I had never really watched , a little station known as SBS . One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan - ' Police Story ' would be on later . Being fifteen , and having only seen ' Rumble in the Bronx ' and ' Rush Hour ' , I said ... " WOW AWESOME " and sat down to watch it , and continually shouted " WOW AWESOME " as the movie progressed . Two weeks later , after SBS had shown the ' Police Story ' trilogy , I knew I had found my new favourite actor.<br /><br />Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui , a Hong Kong cop who busts a major drug - lord , Chu ( Yuen Chor ) . Chu 's secretary , Selina Fong ( Brigitte Lin ) , is being held by the police as a witness against Chu , and Chan is assigned to protect her . Things go bad - reaaaal bad - when Chu 's case is dismissed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead.<br /><br />'Police Story ' is one of the greatest action movies ever , and certainly one of my favourite Jackie Chan films . It starts off strong , and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed . Everything in between is great . However , some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people ... <br /><br />As a story , this is still one of Jackie 's better efforts . For an action movie , the story is pretty good , and Jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting & plot intensive ' New Police Story ' . This is n't ' Miracles ' , but maybe that 's a good thing.<br /><br />'Police Story ' is one of Jackie 's finest works . It got me hooked on Jackie Chan movies , and should provide a nice start for any potential Jackie fans . The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies do n't come much better - 10/10
1 A winters day , 28th December 1986 , two bored 14 year olds hire a movie . " Hmmmm , Police Story , looks interesting " , " who is this Jackie Chan ? " , " never heard of him " . Two hours later after watching the film , in a daze , we wanted to know more . 16 years later ( and severely out of pocket from collecting JC movies ! ) the film still grabs me like no other . Ok , maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my " first " ( Cannonball Run does n't count ! ! ) JC movie , but it is an excellent movie . It has all the classic JC elements , Action , Humour , Action , Heart and ACTION ! Some comments say it 's dated , it was made in 1985 , of course it 's dated ! But then so must Jaws , Casablanca , Singin ' in the Rain and The Godfather ! ! ! ! ! ! Without movies like Police Story where would Hollywood action be today ? PS set standards , many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies . To really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen , you miss so much of the movie otherwise ( yes , he really does fall off the bus going round the corner ! ) . If you have n't already , SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!<br /><br / >
1 Probably Jackie Chan 's best film in the 1980s , and the one that put him on the map . The scale of this self - directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes , during which a squatters ' village and shopping mall are demolished . There are , clearly , differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions , with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter . The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals . In fact , the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time , trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English , while the original has this scene in Cantonese!<br /><br />Nonetheless , Chan 's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible , so non - Cantonese audiences do n't miss much . It 's not , after all , the dialogue that makes a Chan flick , but the action and the painful out - takes . The story is easy to follow : Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather ( Cho Yeun ) , and assigned to protect a star witness ( Brigitte Lin ) . The action is superb from beginning to end , and there 's not much time to breathe in between . It 'll never get you thinking , but what an entertaining , and well strung - together , film . Arguably , this is one of the best martial arts films out there .
1 Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and Police Story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late , great Bruce Lee . If Enter The Dragon bared the so - called bench mark of Lee 's greatness in the 70s , then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s.<br /><br />Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy , or any of his US efforts- the one film that really typifies Chan 's excellence , not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking , bone - crushing kung- fu talisman , as well as his movie career was this , Police Story- the first in a series of successful cop films , set in mainland , present day Hong Kong.<br /><br />I've seen many of his efforts- likewise the US - based Rush Hour , Rumble in the Bronx , The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name- and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to Police Story . In those movies , we saw a less ' dumbed down ' version of Jackie , of whom did n't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum , not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master , Police Story to name . < br /><br />The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie . The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed : the flying shards of glass , Chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town , and Chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with . < br /><br />Considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm 's way , Jackie 's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one , is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert . Especially as he has the bruises to show for it . Thus , he has proved that he is no one - trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves.<br /><br />Story - wise , there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative , it makes up with its end - to end action and fight sequences . As for the dialogue , well it 's not a really huge aspect of the film- which is why most fans of Jackie 's and martial arts films are more interested in action , as opposed to the story.<br /><br />Unlike say The Matrix , there are no wires or CGI , or any form of computer trickery involved . What you see is what you get- and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic , full of action and pulsating stunts . It is miles better than Rumble In The Bronx , Rush Hour and all his other American efforts.<br /><br />Police Story is an excellent film and one I 'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice Jackie Chan fan , but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first .
1 Back when musicals were n't showcases for choreographers , we had wonderful movies such as this one.<br /><br />Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was delighted to finally see this movie . Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood , but close enough . Some of the American vaudeville humour , the slapstick not the witty banter , clash with Wodehouse 's British sense of humour . But on the whole , the American style banter makes the American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.<br /><br />Some inventive staging for the dance numbers , including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors , more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number . They seem a lot more realistic , if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic.<br /><br />The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore do n't hurt the movie , instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge . It 's also nice not to have a wise cracking , headstrong love interest . Instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest , far more in keeping with Wodehouses ' young aristocratic females .
1 This musical is decidedly mixed , and none of the elements really fit together , but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable . The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse 's novel , but none of its virtues , though he co - wrote the script . The songs , though charming , have nothing to do with this particular film , and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot , even by pre - Oklahoma standards . Burns and Allen do their usual shtick quite competently , but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty IQ points.<br /><br />There are a few high points . Reginald Gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie , and stops mugging like a silent actor . And there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by Wodehouse , though most of the film feels like the production of one of the Hollywood meetings he later parodied .
1 Joan Fontaine is " A Damsel in Distress " in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire , George Burns , and Gracie Allen . The plot , what there is of it , is about a British woman ( Fontaine ) in love with an American , who is mistaken for Astaire , a musical comedy star.<br /><br />The film , directed by George Stevens , contains some wonderful Gershwin music , including " Nice Work if You Can Get It " and " A Foggy Day . " The best scene is the " Stiff Upper Lip " number , which takes place in a fun house.<br /><br />Astaire 's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others , and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers . Burns plays his over the top publicist and Allen is Burns ' secretary . She 's hilarious . The problem , as others have pointed out , is Fontaine , who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film . Stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot , and it takes place among the trees . I would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws .
1 A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs , Fred Astaire , Joan Fontaine , and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns.<br /><br />Typically silly plot for an Astaire film has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen his secretary . They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right . He runs into Fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father . Silly plot.<br /><br />The great songs include A Foggy Day , Things Are Looking Up , Nice Work if You Can get It , and I Ca n't Be Bothered Now . Fontaine does not sing , but does a brief ( and decent ) number with Astaire . Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen , including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park.<br /><br />Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner , Constance Collier , Montagu Love , Harry Watson ( as Albert ) , Ray Noble , and my favorite -- Jan Duggan as the lead madrigal singer.<br /><br />Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings Nice Work if You Can Get It . Her facial expressions are hilarious . She was also a scene stealer in the W.C. Fields comedy , The Old Fashioned Way , playing Cleopatra Pepperday.<br /><br />Much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers , who , as noted elsewhere , would have been hideously miscast . The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered . Yikes . Two more would - be disasters . Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to Astaire , with ample comic relief by Burns and Allen.<br /><br />Fun film , great songs , good cast , and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight !
1 I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and turned down co - starring with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress . Jessie Matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any American musical films . IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event.<br /><br />It 's a pity because Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it . Fred Astaire , story and adapted to screen by author P.G. Wodehouse , Burns&Allen for comedy , and songs by the Gershwin Brothers . In answer to the question posed by the Nice Work If You Can Get It , there is n't much you could ask more for this film.<br /><br />Except a leading lady . Though Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire , Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team . Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire.<br /><br />Her character has none of the bite that Ginger Rogers 's parts do in these films . All she basically has to do is act sweet and demure . She also does n't contribute anything musically . And if I had to rate all the dancing partners of Fred Astaire , Joan Fontaine would come out at the bottom . The poor woman is just horrible in the Things Are Looking Up number . < br /><br />When she co - starred later on in a musical with Bing Crosby , The Emperor Waltz , it 's no accident that Fontaine is given nothing musical to do.<br /><br />The version I have is a colorized one and in this case I think it actually did some good . The idyllic lush green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy . Especially in that number I mentioned before with Astaire and Fontaine which does take place in the garden.<br /><br />Burns&Allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement Astaire in grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip number . The surreal fun - house sequence is marvelously staged.<br /><br />P.G. Wodehouse 's aristocracy runs the gamut with Constance Collier at her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaine 's father as a nice man on film.<br /><br />The biggest hit out of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day maybe the best known song about the British capital city since London Bridge Is Falling Down . Done in the best simple elegant manner by Fred Astaire , it 's one of those songs that will endure as long as London endures and even after.<br /><br />Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine , A Damsel in Distress rates as a classic , classic score , classic dancing , classic comedy . Who could ask for anything more ?
1 Soon Americans would swarm over a darkened , damaged England preparing to invade Europe , but in 1937 the picture of hip Americans in the sunny , slightly ridiculous English countryside was an appealing , idyllic diversion . American dancing star & heartthrob Jerry Halliday ( Astaire ) , on a European tour & weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager ( Burns ) , is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress Lady Alice Marshmorton ( Fontaine ) . The tale is complicated by a betting pool among the Marshmorton servants that is run by ( and rigged for ) head butler Keggs ( Gardiner ) , who 's betting on Lady Alice 's cousin Reggie ( Noble ) , the favorite of Alice 's stuffy , domineering aunt ( Collier ) . The story would have been much better as a half - hour TV episode . The usual Wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full - length film . Both Alice & Jerry appear impossibly ( and annoyingly ) clueless by the second half of the film . The amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag . Fontaine is too beautiful , too dignified & too quiet to be a ditzy blonde , no matter how aristocratic , while young footman Albert ( Watson ) is painfully awful . But while " Damsel " is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent , the talent does n't let us down . Astaire 's romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with Ginger Rogers and his dance scenes , both solo & with Burns & Allen , are up to par , though his one dance with novice hoofer Joan is necessarily tame . Gracie nearly steals the whole show as George 's bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded , conniving & coolly self - confident . Her scene with solid character actor Gardiner as the devious snob Keggs is a one - of - a - kind classic . This & Astaire 's priceless scene with the madrigal singers give " Damsel " a delightful color of naive but noble - spirited Americans mixing with noble but dull - spirited Englishmen . Gershwin is at the top of his game with " Nice Work if You Can Get it " & " Stiff Upper Lip , " which carry the film through its weak points . And is there another film where madrigals get a Gershwin swing treatment ? " Damsel " is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see Astaire without Rogers or Fontaine before she was a real star . It 's a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again .
1 This movie appears to have designed as a Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers film -- the plot outline , dance numbers , zippy music and the entire formula is there ... except for Ginger ! Whether it REALLY was originally intended as a re - pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films . Instead of the usual sidekicks for Fred ( such as Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton ) , Burns and Allen are used -- probably since despite being known as a comedy team , they COULD sing and dance quite well . This actually shocked me , but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional Fred and Ginger numbers were done with either Fred and Gracie or these two along with George . Only once , at the very end , does Ms. Fontaine dance with Fred but it 's very brief and with a distant camera shot.<br /><br />And speaking of Burns and Allen , I think I owe it to the team to talk about them in the film . I have never been a fan of their show or their movies . In general , I find Gracie 's idiot act very annoying and I have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full - length films . However , in this film I must admit that they were great -- not only dancing competently but I actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by Edward Everett Horton very nicely . They were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department.<br /><br />Now as for the rest of the film , it 's all a lot of fun and is entertaining . The problem for me , though , was that Joan Fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie -- not just because she was acting outside her range ( after all , she was n't a singer or dancer ) , but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint . Because of this , the usual balance and great boy - girl dialog was lacking . There was also a very charming performance by Harry Watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid -- all because he wanted to win a bet ! And finally , I loved the Fun House and Tunnel of Love sequence -- it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch ! Overall , I did like the film quite a bit -- it had a lot of charm and excellent writing . Unfortunately , it also featured a bland performance by Ms. Fontaine that knocks off a point -- bringing my score for this film to 7 .
1 I first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when I have an opportunity . It is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics . Should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated , ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music . The dancing is n't as important in this film as in other Astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through . See this movie if you can , it may be light but it is still completely amusing . So I know that many people hate black and white films , they think old movies ca n't really be funny , this movie should make them change their minds . No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused . The only problem with the film : Fred Astaire singing without dancing . He may be a great performer and capable singer but it just is n't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story . The comedy gets a bit cliché at times but the vaudevillesque performances of G burns and G Allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs . Give this film a chance even if you do n't like old movies , this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one .
1 The question of whether or not one likes this film version of " The Ghost Train " invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone : your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey.<br /><br />He tends to steal almost every scene he 's in , and not always in a good way . Sometimes you wish he 'd settle down or back off just a little , to allow the plot 's many characters to feature and develop ( which they do to some extent ) . But somehow everything keeps pointing back to Askey 's Tommy Gander character.<br /><br />Personally I like the film , and even like Askey to an extent . I always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when I ca n't sleep and really ca n't find the energy to watch anything else . There is something about watching old b / w movies in the quiet dark of pre - dawn that I find appealing ....
1 Curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused , irritated and frightened . The creaky old plot about about a phantom train that 's said to run through the lonely English countryside at dead of night may be implausible , but it 's a lot of fun . There are some wonderful old cliches like " THE ACCIDENT " which the locals can remember but wo n't talk about . But primarily the movie 's a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits . Askey 's corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun . This is probably the best of Askey 's movies .
1 I have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind , movies by Will Hay and Abbot & Costello especially as those are my favourites . I picked this movie up on DVD as it was using the same idea as Will Hay 's " Oh Mr Porter " which is one of the finest comedies ever made . I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago ( the movie finished at 12:45am ) . I find that movies of this kind , to do with Ghost Trains , etc , are best viewed at night time with the lights out . That way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie.<br /><br />The one - liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers , I guess this depends on the viewer . They are not dated to me though . I am 28 and even though I am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released ( my dad was though ) . I still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind . Sitting in the room in front of the TV with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies , not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this . It is an escape from reality for a while.<br /><br />I noticed that one of the men in the movie ( he has a black mustache ) he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station . This man was in the Will Hay classic " The Ghost of St Michaels " as well . Just thought I 'd point that out in case no one noticed : ) .<br /><br />The set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric . Outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction , and the inside of the station is very cosy looking away from the rain storm that is outside . I felt like I would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast . The atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now . It keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes.<br /><br />We need more of this type of movie in todays market . But sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour . This sort of movie making era ( The Ghost Train , Oh Mr Porter , etc ) to me is the golden age of cinema!.
1 Now this is one of Big 's Best , Jack Hulbert 's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch . It boasts a great stalwart cast , who ham the play up for all they 're worth , especially Askey of course . Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers , melodramatics by Herbert Lomas , and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for , ghostly trains , spectral porters , hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all . His repartee with everyone falls between side - splitting and ghastly dull . When the formula works it 's very good , but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is . But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any God Britain has n't got any nowadays!<br /><br />Ultimately a nice harmless film , to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend , but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you 'll probably be very disappointed !
1 Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining film , typical of the better British comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s . The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they once apparently were , but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity.<br /><br />For a low - budget wartime production , Ghost Train is atmospheric , effective , and it provides some genuine suspense . Great fun for a dark ( and , yes , stormy ) night . Lighten up , take off the critic 's hat , and enjoy .
1 So your bairns are away on a sleep - over ? The wife is visiting the mother in law ? You though are at home . It 's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking ? So now what are you going to do ? < br /><br />I will tell you ! < br /><br />Go make an old fashioned cocoa ( Frys is best!)Get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the DVD . Now go select and play Arthur Askeys world war two thriller / horror The Ghost Train , return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in!<br /><br />The Ghost Train is a genuine British war time classic ! Arthur Askey with his side kick , Stinker Murdoch , entertain you and I suspect the cast , to a high octane , thrills and spills , espionage thriller . It 's set in old rural England during the second world war.<br /><br />It centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight , through circumstances outside any ones ' control , in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train.<br /><br />The plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary ! < br /><br />(The tale was written by that old boy Godfrey of Dads Army fame and it is clever ) < br /><br />Arthur Askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast , he also shows he can act a bit ! The cast are never out staged though , even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas.<br /><br />Oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer !
1 The Ghost Train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940 's humour . It incorporates World War Two into the plot but not as much as I initially believed it would , and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well . Askey , playing the role of Tommy Gander , is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or " dragging".<br /><br />The story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards . It is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is The Ghost Train . Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well . He is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being " annoying " but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940 's humour . His humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch.<br /><br />If it was not for Askey / Gander , than this film would of been shorter in action , enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion .
1 This was fun to watch , spookily atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of World War Two . The plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance.<br /><br />It must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940 's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the Nazis - well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to Britain from third columnists.<br /><br />But Arthur Askey was so annoying & unfunny you just wanted him to shut up - well at least I did ! I suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome . If he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded.<br /><br />A good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes - a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like ; uncomfortable slow , dirty trains , being thrown off for no reason , surly staff ....
1 This film is one of those nostalgia things with me and I never REALLY expect anyone else to " get it " but am pleased when I recommend it and somebody DOES enjoy it . My late father HATED Arthur Askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for " The Ghost Train " and " Old Ted ' Olmes " transferred to me as a child . Years later , I watch it every now and again , enjoying the familiarity . I always wonder if it will not be quite the same but I am never disappointed in it . There is much to enjoy . The sequence on the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger . Then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up . Yes , it is dated and full of wartime Britishness in accents and plot ( based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad 's Army fame ! ) but full of wonderful character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster . The atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get . This is available cheap as chips in the UK on DVD so treat yourself . It is a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment . I Thank You .... <br /><br />OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES !
1 This is a classic British comedy - thriller I had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now . It 's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously ( most notably in 1931 by the same director but , unfortunately , this version seems not to have survived in its entirety ! ) ; for the remake under review , the plot has been updated to the then - current wartime situation.<br /><br />Anyway , I was mainly familiar with early British comedians through the films of Will Hay : given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings , smuggling and enemy agents , it 's very much in that vein ( it was actually scripted by Hay 's regular writing team of Marriott Edgar , Val Guest and J.O.C. Orton ) ; the stranded travelers element , then , was an equally tried - and - true formula . The star this time around is Arthur Askey ( abetted by Richard Murdoch ) - none of whose films I had watched before - who is as unlikely a hero as Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating ... but one soon warms up to him , and Askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play ( and the 1931 film version ) was split into two here , with Murdoch acting as the star 's straight partner.<br /><br />The remote single setting ( the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night ) provides for some wonderful atmosphere ; the last half - hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple ( Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers ) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled . Also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster , with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink .
1 Hello Playmates . I recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of Arthur Askey , I have to admit I was very impressed by this film . As a fan of black and white films generally , passport to pimlico , the lavender hill mob and Tommy Trinder ( who is apparently a distant relative ) , this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned British humour . I notice that there are some on here who have criticised Askey 's performance , however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now . If you can get hold of this film I would recommend you get hold of it , shame these films generally are n't shown on Sunday afternoons anymore . I am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley ( Private Godfrey in dad 's army).I thank you
1 One of my favourite films first saw it when I was about 10 , which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour . Although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it . Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so popular in its day , with lots of interesting , quirky co - characters . The lady with the parrot , the couple due to get married and are in trouble from ' her ' , and my favourite , the stationmaster , " Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes .. " Interestingly the ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley of Dads Army fame ( Private Godfrey the medic ) Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile .
1 As a matter of fact , this is one of those movies you would have to give 7.5 to . The fact is ; as already stated , it 's a great deal of fun . Wonderfully atmospheric . Askey does indeed come across as over the top , but it 's a great vehicle for him , just as Oh , Mr Porter is for Will hay . If you like old dark house movies and trains , then this is definitely for you.<br /><br />Strangely enough it 's the kind of film that you 'll want to see again and again . It 's friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare . The ' odd ' band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical British wartime movie . It would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by Ealing studios . A real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact
1 If the very thought of Arthur Askey twists your guts , do n't worry , you can still watch and love The Ghost Train , like the equally marvellous Back Room Boy , it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance , even that of the lead actor . Personally , I love Askey , perhaps it 's because I go into his world , rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine , which is a mistake too many people make . The Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you could n't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep , dark world it transports you to , it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag - wavers managed to be during the desperate early ' 40s and it 's a film that I would imagine few people have ever watched just the once . The cast are , without exception , extraordinarily good , perhaps Linden Travers lays it on a bit thick , but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime , she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out . The sad passing of the lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past , but waiting patiently for us to press play .
1 In the colonies we 're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey , so I nearly skipped this film ( which had its TCM preview recently ) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in " Ghost Train " -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying . Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly . The physical aspects of Askey 's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you 'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby . There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre . One can feel , moreover , the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later ; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here . As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you 've seen , the more likely you 'll guess at the ending , but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance .
1 I have seen the recent Region 2 DVD of this movie displayed in the " horror " section in an Oxford Street store and also advertised as a " classic thriller " . In reality it is almost solely a vehicle for Arthur Askey , one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades.<br /><br />Perhaps his incessantly cheerful , exuberant and essentially good - natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much British comedy of the past twenty five years . However there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos . Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper who frequently borrowed the " self - strangulation " gag that Arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with.<br /><br />There is a striking , rare appearance by the under - rated Linden Travers , who makes an impact as the mysterious Julie .
1 a timeless classic , wonderfully acted with perfect location settings , conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie . a simple story mingled with humor and suspense . i wish that a video was available in Britain . i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter .
1 This movie reminded me that some old Black & White movies are definitely worth the look.<br /><br />Initially I had some reservations , however from the beginning of the movie until the end I was captivated . I was VERY impressed with the mixture of drama , suspense & comedy.<br /><br />Arthur Askey ( Tommy Gander ) is HILARIOUS and had me in stitches the whole time.<br /><br />Definitely add this movie to your movie - night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and " too " powerful or overly " funny " movies of today .
1 I was young film student in 1979 when the Union of the Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovsky 's " Siberiade " ; Tarkosvky 's " Stalker " and Danelia'a " Autumn marathon " . I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form . Then and only then , I saw " Siberiade " 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless . Way better then Bertolucci 's " 1900 " . By far!<br /><br />Hope Andron will somehow get to the negative and make " director 's restored version full lenght " someday ! On DVD of course ! Also I fiercely fought in defense of this Cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating Soviet film with bad taste ! Time is on my side .
1 I have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take ( because of its length and story ) , I liked it very much . I was impressed first , by the script and then , by the realization of this script . The film takes you on a ride , but that is not an easy , joyful ride ; it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people 's lives . What I loved was the inner logic the film followed ; logic , which just like logic in life , was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end , when I thought about it , all the events and twists made sense . It makes no sense though to try to re - tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time . I also liked very much Nikita Mikhalkov 's character Aleksei and the way he played it , as some critics would saw , with restless abandon . What I did n't like about it , was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like " Cruel Romance " ( Zhestokij romans , which I actually love ) and to some extent in " The Insulted and the Injured " ( " Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye " ) . " Sibiriada " shows , I think , what a great film - maker Andrei Konchalovski was before he went to Hollywood and made forgettable films like " Tango and Cash " and less forgettable like " Runaway train " . I would prefer " Kurochka Ryaba " to them ...
1 It is a story of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties . It is about passion and feelings , about Russian soul , and very romantic . This movie IS NOT action packed , it flowes slowely . In second part one can find great songs - Russian romances . It is much more better than Doctor Zhivago . The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example .
1 For anyone who wishes to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history this monumental film is a treasure . The story starts at the turn of the century ( 1900 ) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times ( i.e. the 1960s).<br /><br />The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village , who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era . He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village . His son , by the local beauty , fights the Germans during the Second World War . When he returns to the village , the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some Soviet economic idealism.<br /><br />This film is long and slow , but utterly logic and very well made . It can be seen in three parts .
1 The legend of Andrei Konchalovsky 's towering 4 and a half hour poem to Siberia is not to begin at once , because it must hold back for space , because it takes its time in roundabout explorations of half - remembered childhood memories in a turn - of - the - century backwoods village , yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the Soviet working spirit . Konchalovsky celebrates Soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like Soy Cuba and Invincible the mood turns somber and reflective . News of the revolution reach the secluded Siberian village through the grapevine . The fruits of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist . Through all this , Konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual , with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancé who never came back , waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiancé 's father with an axe , the irreverent folly of the fiancé who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late , came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland , the despair and resignation of the middle - aged Regional Party Leader who comes back to his small Siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant . The movie segues from decade to decade from the 10 's to the 80 's with amazing newsreel footage trailing Soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire ( terrific visuals here ! all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces ) but the actual movie focuses on the individual , on triumphs and follies small and big . By the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in ; of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning . " It ca n't matter " , seems like the world is saying , to which Konchalovksy answers " it must matter " because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption.<br /><br />Yet behind this saga of ' man against landscape ' something seems to hover , shadowy , almost substanceless , like the Eternal Old Man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists , sometimes a mere spectactor , sometimes the enigmatic sage ; a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters , something invisible seems to lurk . Ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams , repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky , a curious bear , indeed the Eternal Old Man himself ; Konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order . In its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them , often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time , and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism , it reminds me of Shohei Imamura 's The Profound Desires of the Gods . When , in a dream scene , Alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of Stalin to reach out at his ( dead ) father as he vanishes in the fog , the movie hints at the betrayal of the Soviet Dream , or better yet , at all the things lost in the revolution , this betrayal made more explicit in the film 's fiery denouement . The amazing visuals , elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge , help seal the deal . By the end of it , an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema .
1 Apart from having the longest reign in British history ( 63 years ) , Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions . She was , apart from our current Queen , the oldest ever British monarch , living to the age of 81 . And she was also the youngest ever British ( as opposed to English or Scottish ) monarch , coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen . And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her , they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl ; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in " Mrs Brown " . " The Young Victoria " tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign . It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal , Sarah Duchess of York , whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br /><br />There are three main strands to the plot . The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria 's mother , the Duchess of Kent , a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter , largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy , who was widely rumoured to be her lover . ( According to one unfounded rumour he , and not the late Duke of Kent , was Victoria 's natural father ) . The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert , and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium , who was uncle to both of them , to influence this romance . ( Leopold 's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe - Coburg , to which both he and Albert belonged ) . The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history , the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839 , when supporters of the Tory Party ( which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy ) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne , even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi - republican system of government , with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br /><br />Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views , and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes , as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories , the predecessors of the modern Conservative party . Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified , whereas Melbourne , for all his dash and charm , is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform . There may be some truth is these characterisations , but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act , which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs , and that they had benefited from William IV 's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br /><br />Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen , and this one contains its share of inaccuracies . Prince Albert , for example , was not injured in Edward Oxford 's attempt on Victoria 's life , and Melbourne ( in his late fifties at the time of Victoria 's accession ) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany . King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent ( who was his sister - in - law ) , but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet , as he is shown doing here . I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a " Regency Order " ; the Duchess 's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830 , which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession . No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br /><br />There are also occasional infelicities . In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard , a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a " Danger ! Major cliché ahead ! " warning . Yet in spite of scenes like this , I came to enjoy the film . There were some good performances , especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy . It is visually very attractive , being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama . Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William , although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top . ( Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in " Moulin Rouge").<br /><br />The main reason for the film 's success , however , is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert . Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life , but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination , the black - clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused , but a determined , strong - minded and loving young woman . Her love for Albert , and their happy family life together , was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people . ( With the exception of George III , Victoria 's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues ) . Blunt and Friend make " The Young Victoria " a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history . 8/10
1 I went into this expecting not to like it ; I figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest , and rather plodding and dull.<br /><br />It 's actually far better than that , and I found myself really enjoying it . I do n't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert , who died young , and she mourned him ever after . Seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating ; in fact I found myself wishing I 'd seen more of the story , and I imagine we may see a sequel at some point.<br /><br />Visually the film is stunning . The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top . The acting is top notch from everybody involved.<br /><br />In a word , it was great !
1 Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke - warm , I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as ' Mills and Boon ' , so what ? It is good to see a warm , touching story of real love in these cynical times . Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes . You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other , even though , for political reasons , it was an arranged marriage . I did feel though that Sir John Conroy , who was desperate to control the young Queen , is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain . As it is rumoured that he was in fact , the real father of Victoria ( as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent ) it would have been interesting to explore this theory . Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess , trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her . She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England , which prospered as never before , under her long reign . I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie .
1 The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history . On the one hand , her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes , and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human . Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront , director Jean - Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria 's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy . It 's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background , and yet that 's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.<br /><br />Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert , The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer . Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure 's entire life , Vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria 's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades . The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like , yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story , writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal . Vallée takes this and runs , making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.<br /><br />A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800 's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films . Everything from the costume designs , sets , hair styles , lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria 's story without ever over - encumbering it . Indeed , while watching Vallée 's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element ; and then there 's the film 's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes ' script . Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert 's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with , but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri 's original work just as well.<br /><br />Yet for all the poignant compositions , lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene , the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life . Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that . Between the sweet , budding romance of Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) and Albert ( Rupert Friend ) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like ( spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany ) , the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe 's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic " nice to look at but dim underneath " affair so common with these outings.<br /><br />In the end , it 's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria . It 's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance , plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details . Of course , it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama ; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable . Vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur , nor does he seem content at making a run - of - the - mill escapist piece for aficionados . Somewhere within this gray middle - ground lies The Young Victoria , sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions ; beautiful , memorable but most of all , human.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward ( http://www.invocus.net )
1 Rupert Friend gives a performance , as Prince Albert , that lifts " The Young Victoria " to unexpected levels . He is superb . As we know , Queen Victoria fell into a dark , deep depression after Prince Albert 's death and looking into Ruper Friend 's eyes I understood . The film does n't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life . An act of love . I believed it , or I should say , him . I believed what he felt was real . Nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of Friend 's characterization . Emily Blunt is good but I did n't believe for a minute she was Victoria . No real sense of period . It may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown .
1 And that 's why historic / biographic movies are so important to all of us , moreover when they are so well done , like this one!<br /><br />Before I saw " The Young Victoria " , I knew a few things about Queen Victoria , but in the end I got much more knowledge about it . < br /><br />Emily Blunt is simply GREAT as Victoria ( Who would guess that ! ) and She probably will get a nomination at this years Oscar 's . Personally , I 'm cheering for her ... <br /><br />For technical issues , I am pleased to say that is a very successful production , with wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and , of course , like It was expected to be , a terrific periodic Costume Design ! < br /><br />The one drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen , but foremost , incredible woman and mother ! < br /><br />BRAVO : 9 out of 10 !
1 This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of Great Britain.<br /><br />"The Young Victoria " has amazing production . Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail . The extravagant costumes , lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make " The Young Victoria " very impressive . I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography . How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out , every scene is well composed . The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne . Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria 's angle , while from Melbourne 's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.<br /><br />Story wise , it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria . Many events are rushed through or not even explained . I expected a grand scene of the coronation , and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.<br /><br />Overall , " The Young Victoria " is a good film , and it would have been even better if it was longer , so that events could be properly explained without rush .
1 Princess Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) is in line for the throne of England . The present King William ( Jim Broadbent ) is not well and may not live long . However , Vicky 's scheming mother , The Duchess of Kent ( Miranda Richandson ) and her aide , John ( Mark Strong ) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the " regents " until she is older , since she is only 20 years of age . The young lady refuses , despite John slapping her around . It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country . Yet , when William does pass away , shortly after her 21st birthday , Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her . First , she must surround herself with the " right " advisers to govern wisely . She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) who , although an older man , is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky . Which brings us to the young queen 's second major decision . Sooner than not , the young queen should select her future mate , as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom , for an heir must appear in the coming years . Meanwhile , in Germany , some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well . Handsome Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) , of the Saxon - Coburg dynasty , is prodded by his father to court the young English royal . Once he arrives at the palace , he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual . But , since he is a minor player on the map of royal match - making , can he succeed in winning her heart ? This is a lovely film , made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria . Yes , she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily . Friend , too , does well , as do the other actors , including Broadbent , Richardson , Bettany , Strong ( what a repulsive role ! ) , and the rest . Also , the movie is gorgeously shot , costumed , and set , making it a visual treat in every way . If anything is lacking , it is an extra dose of dazzle , as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic , at times , with a somewhat unimaginative edit . However , this is only a minor , minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film . In short , young and old , should make time for Young Victoria . It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings .
1 The cinematic interests in the British monarchy continues with The Young Victoria ( 1837 to 1901 ) , after having seen in recent years , the efforts with Keira Knightley 's The Duchess , Cate Blanchett 's Elizabeth films , and Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman 's take on the Boleyn sisters with The Other Boleyn Girl . More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren 's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana 's death.<br /><br />Each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ( ok , so some may dispute Johansson ) or were the flavour of their moment , and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character 's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured , and in fact Elizabeth had enough to span two films . However , The Young Victoria , as the title already suggests , is a lite - version of the young queen 's life , and if you 're looking for that definitive event , or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady , self - serving politicians , unfortunately there 's nothing of depth here.<br /><br />That 's not to say The Young Victoria is without . Directed by Canadian Jean - Marc Vallee ( best known for CRAZY ) and written by Julian Fellowes , this film chronicles in very plain terms , , the life and times of Victoria ( Emily Blunt , soon becoming the new It girl ) when she was a child , the troubles she faced before Coronation such as the eagerness of her mom The Duchess of Kent ( Miranda Richardson ) and her adviser Sir John Conroy ( Mark Strong ) to appoint themselves as joint - Regent to her throne , as already planned for by reigning King William ( Jim Broadbent ) . As if that was n't enough , the political power play enters the picture with Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) being a Prime Minister - in - waiting trying to gain the trust of the new Queen , and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace . On one hand you 'd understand the need for a young , and new Queen to have trusted people in key positions , but on the other , are they really acting in her interests , or in the interests of others?<br /><br />Even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) , where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film , and pretty much everything already included in the trailers . For both , they 've been brought up under the influence of others , and told each step of the way exactly what to do . Even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance , if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding , and to do so with the help of each other . Instead of being pawns , there 's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling , and at times absurd , rules and regulations . Trust also becomes a much valued commodity , and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean.<br /><br />However , all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative , from childhood to romance , marriage and children . In fact , there 's so much fast - forwarding here , especially the last few minutes filled with inter - titles , that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more , and room of course for another movie , which I suspect would probably not see the light of day , but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film 's response , and come out with a mini - series or such . It 's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes , sets and art direction would be confined to a film that 's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues , that they do n't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character - defining adversary.<br /><br />With its star - studded cast , one would expect more , but one would be left wanting more instead . Recommended for those who are ever curious about Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy , only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned .
1 It is a tricky thing to play a queen . On the one hand , the actress has to be majestic and imperious , and on the other , she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds , since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line . < br /><br />Emily Blunt is quite radiant as Victoria , but it 's not as full a performance as I 'd like , no blame to her . I ca n't help but feel like this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker , more dramatic movie about another young queen , Elizabeth . Hence Blunt does n't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions , at least not to the full extent , since she 's , y'know , the young Victoria . To see the old Victoria , check out Mrs Brown.<br /><br />Jean - Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie . He last did C.R.A.Z.Y. , which was excellent and propelled him to fame . It was quite a different movie but I remember it looking gorgeous and that 's probably the main similarity between the two movies . But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y. , this one was by Julian Fellowes , and though I really enjoyed his Gosford Park , the story for this movie was much less interesting . I soon got lost with all the governmental politics . Maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy . I 'm just saying .
1 Having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs ? Having others taste your food before you eat it ? Facing an over - bearing mother ? These are only a few of the obstacles which the young Victoria has to deal with in this film ( there 's also the various power struggles going on , as well as attempts on her life ) . Needless to say , it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing.<br /><br />I had only previously seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada ( and little else ) . As she was in that film , she is once again the standout here . I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria , and thought she handled the role very well . She makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the start of the film to the Queen Victoria she becomes later entirely believable . Blunt is perfectly cast in the role , showing all the different sides ( from the vulnerable , to the strong , from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the Queen who takes control ) . Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role . She 's - quite simply - exquisite , commanding your attention every second she 's on screen . She keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film.<br /><br />Rupert Friend proves to also be well - cast as Victoria 's love interest ( and eventual husband ) , Prince Albert . The actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship . They have their disagreements , but you can tell that they are in love . Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between Victoria and Albert . The other actors in the film are also very good . Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne , Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent , Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William . There is not a single bad performance in this film . The less - focused - upon people are well - portrayed also , given what little screen time they have . Even Victoria 's dog ( a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash ) is memorable and makes an impact in the film.<br /><br />Although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria 's life - especially at the end - and instead * tells * us what happened ( with her and Albert ) on screen , what matters the most is what we actually * see*. This is , after all , a film about ' The Young Victoria ' ( not ' The Middle - Aged Victoria ' , nor ' The Old Victoria ' ) . While there are some embellishments made on history with this film , it remains focused on what it sets out to do - which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power.<br /><br />The movie looks amazing , the costumes Emily Blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film , never detracts from it . It 's exceptionally shot and , unlike a lot of films these days , this movie is actually a good length , as it does n't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it 's needlessly being drawn out.<br /><br />It goes without saying that what makes this film so great is Emily Blunt . She 's in fine form here , turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been , had another actress been cast in this rather important / historic role . This is one finely - crafted film , with excellent performances that should definitely be seen . If you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history , this is a must - see .
1 One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in , it ends much to soon ! Than were left looking at the screen like , " No they did n't ! " , lol . Good performances all around ! The acting is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply outstanding ! I knew she would give a solid , convincing performance catching young Victoria 's regality , temper , and vulnerability through out the entire movie . Also , the production is outstanding in every way : style , substance and sensitivity . A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian 's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen , later marrying Prince Albert , than ending with the birth of their first of nine children . It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing . Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen 's attention , than securing her love , before Lord Melbourne(Paul Bettany ) , was engrossing to watch . Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother , which was fury at times , as with her mother and King William ( whom also disliked her mother ) . The acting and scenes were captivating , highly emotional . < br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era , and indeed , anyone who loves a compelling true romance story
1 What more can be said ? I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago . And although both Blanchett and Blunt have played Queens now ( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses ) , the roles are complete polar opposites.<br /><br />Simply put if you are looking for high passion , compelling drama , and Machiavellian intrigue , this is not the movie for you . This is n't to say that the script or direction was bad , its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like Elizabeth I , Anne Boylen , Henry VIII , Henry V , Henry II and Elainor of Acquitane . These are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of British , and in most cases , world history . Victoria , in contrast , ascended the throne without incident , she quasi - governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the Navy , her State had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians , and she married young had a harmonious family life . The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of.<br /><br />The heart of the film , aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne , is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story . Marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion , yet Victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a Patron Saint marital fidelity , happiness and ideal family life . Thus , central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert . I was very taken with Rupert Friend 's characterization of Albert whom he portrayed as a kind , patient , somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man , looking to " do good in the world and help " . In short , he is a good man with a good heart , not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around , but as that is not the point of the story , that does not matter . The heart of the character shines through thanks to Friend 's understated yet earnest performance . < br /><br />As for the Queen , well .. Emily Blunt is sublime . Her beauty can not be denied , but she is more than something pretty to look at ; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness . The slightest arch of the eyebrow , glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much . Again , this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas , its not that kind of movie . But what Ms. Blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety . < br /><br />For example , we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by Victoria 's mother ( Miranda Richardson ) and her scheming adviser / lover Conroy expressed in the simple things like Victoria trying to sketch her dog . We see her delight and fascination upon first meeting Albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him . We see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing Parliament upon her Ascension . And my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous , happy , and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her , a proposition so ridiculous for those times ( and some would say now ) that Victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say " marry me " . Again , this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions , but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much.<br /><br />So , overall , I judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such I give it a 7 . I felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development , namely Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent , and the characters of Conroy and Lord Peal . Again , the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters , but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment . Also I would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between Victoria and Albert , but that may be just my greed for more scenes between Friend and Blunt . < br /><br />In summary , do n't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is , a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures . I give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances , brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent Victoria of Emily Blunt . And anyone who has any shred of romance left in them , you will be touched by the end of this movie . God save the Queen .
1 Overall , I thought it a very nice movie - I hate to use the word ' nice ' as it 's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong . What I liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings , all gilded and shiny , this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good , strong writing ( thank you Julian Fellowes : D ) ; nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp , i.e not sensationalised greatly ( when Victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now Queen , well you could n't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown ) . It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth.<br /><br />Undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between Victoria and Albert , though somewhat fairytale - ish on the face it , was in fact a slow burning candle and Friend and Blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people ' fitted ' together despite the union being initially arranged ( my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind ; so much said without any words , that 's what film is all about ) . Blunt held her own beautifully as well , she has a face that demands your attention and I ca n't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous . If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them ! The rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well , Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide being a highlight.<br /><br />The only qualm I have , is that it lacked a sense of urgency , or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting ? ( It was rather tame ) I do n't know , I wanted ' something ' to happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more . When she and Albert argued , I loved it , I could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments , though that may be just me.<br /><br />Lastly , at the risk of sounding all patriotic , it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position , especially in one so young . This may be in part to the fact that this film 's snap shot of Victoria 's young life is immediately apt to what I have been writing for one character of mine in ' The Sword & The Scion ' but nevertheless , it did flag up those feelings ( for those following my book , can you guess what character Victoria so aptly reflects ? ) It might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they did n't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation , which only in turns renews appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic domain . It made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then I suppose.<br /><br />BLOG on films and books : http://sempergratis.blogspot.com
1 I always have a bit of distrust before watching the British period films because I usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays ( such as the ones of , for example , Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl ) , but with a magnificent production design , European landscapes and those thick British accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have . Fortunately , the excellent film The Young Victoria does not fall on that situation , and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story , the excellent performances from Emily Blunt , Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent , and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view . And I say " unexpectedly " because I usually do not pay too much attention to those details.<br /><br />"Victorian era " was ( in my humble opinion ) one of the key points in contemporary civilization , and not only on the social aspect , but also in the scientific , artistic and cultural ones . But I honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much , and maybe because of that I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much . I also liked the way in which Queen Victoria is portrayed , which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good , but they were at least inspired by good intentions . I also found the depiction of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes . The only fail I found on this movie is that screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story , something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay.<br /><br />I liked The Young Victoria very much , and I really took a very nice surprise with it . I hope more period films follow the example of this movie : the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story , and not as the replacement of it .
1 The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has presented Queen Victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her . The films wipes away the " I am not amused " impression of Queen Victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman.<br /><br />As I love history , particularly Victorian history , you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised , i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas . I was a little worried that it would n't be historically accurate , but it was and I loved it . I found out new facts about Queen Victoria that did n't know before and it interested me greatly.<br /><br />Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest Monarchs , and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like . She was treated so badly by her mothers adviser Sir John Conroy , because he wanted Britain to have a regency . This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen , which she was ! The romance between her and Albert was so deep and this was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend , who were both brilliant ! The Young Victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of British History ... I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 10/10 ... no doubt !
1 Enjoyed the movie very much . Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more , and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!<br /><br />Did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization , particularly of the shooting event ? There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at ? Prince Albert 's contribution to UK and the monarchy warrants a movie on it 's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here.<br /><br />The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production ( which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one ) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York ? i.e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle / rissole ( ? ) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full ? < br /><br />'Could never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain this movie , or indeed in her shoes at all . Yet loved the casting of the principals , whose acting was convincing , so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well ? I always felt like a totally detached , uninformed outside observer , much more so than with " Mrs. Brown " or even " The Queen " . Yet to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen , except that is for some of the more avant - garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time .
1 This is on my top list of all - time favourite films ! It is a fantastic and insightful film . It was Historically interesting and great to watch ! I thought the acting from Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert , the best actor was chosen for Albert . The costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house , were amazing and detailed . I just loved it , all of it ! I loved the childhood scenes were she 's getting ' bullied ' by John Conroy . And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult . One again the writers have done it ! They produced this fantastic script ! < br /><br />It thoroughly deserves the awards they got . ( Oscar and BAFTA wining Sandy Powell , for costume design . A BAFTA for best make - up and hair , an Oscar in Best Achievement in Art Direction , Best Achievement in Costume Design , Best Achievement in Makeup . Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards for Best costume design , also nominated for best actress Emily Blunt . CDG for Excellence in Costume Design for Film - Period . Hampton 's International Film Awards for an Audience Award for Best Narrative Film . PFCS for Best Costume design . Sudbury Cinefest , does n't say what for . VFCC for Best Actress , Emily Blunt . ) Overall 10 wins and 11 nominations ! That pretty good ! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Have a look yourself , its really interesting ! Personally Rupert Friend should have got an award .
1 I saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it . The period of Queen Victoria 's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the world.<br /><br />The script is perfect , the acting is amazing , the history and attention to detail is out of this world . Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria . Funny how her mother is played by Elizabeth the 1st and William IV is played by Prince Albert ! ( Think Blackadder).<br /><br />This portrayal of Victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once - I 'm sure she would have been on Jeremey Kyle Show if it had been around then : " My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life".<br /><br />A Perfect piece of a major part of British and Commonwealth history .
1 It is Queen Victoria 's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men . Shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to the extent that she became known as " Mrs Melbourne".After the death of her beloved husband , Albert , she was referred to as " The Widow at Windsor",and years later , a long friendship with her Scottish ghillie John Brown earned her the nickname " Mrs Brown".Such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society . The reality is somewhat different and " Young Victoria " goes some way towards putting the record straight , depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court . Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy , plotting and counter - plotting , naked ambition and sometimes , outright murder . As an 18 year old innocent , Victoria ascended to her uncle 's throne , thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power - struggle between Prime minister Lord Melbourne and his rival Sir Robert Peel . Lord Melbourne cuts a dash in the Old Public School Man kind of way with his finely - honed cynicism and his well - polished gems of advice . Hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him , and even perhaps a little in love , an awe that he ruthlessly exploits , drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against Victoria 's better judgement . Into the arena rides Prince Albert , on a mission from King Leopold of Belgium , keen on political rapprochement between Great Britain and the rest of Europe . At first a reluctant suitor , he soon falls in love with the English queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers . " The Young Victoria " is a beautifully photographed , brilliantly - scored and very sumptuous movie . I note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century English Royalty should somehow have shown the Empress of India and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse ........ I do n't think so . I must single out the remarkable Miss Emily Blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young Princess Margaret's . Hers is obviously the pivotal role , and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from Mr Jim Broadbent , Miss Miranda Richardson and Miss Harriet Walter , all immeasurably more experienced . The music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive . The fact that Britan flourished more under its two great queens , Elizabeth the First and Victoria , than at any other time is a matter Feminists might like to make more of , but , I suspect , like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable . If you can work out why there might be a Ph . D . in it .
1 I was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the Royal families of Britain and their history , and she wo n't go to the cinema without me . Although viewers should n't expect to be electrified , this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none . In many ways it helps dispel the myth that Victoria was the miserable unsmiling dumpy woman usually seen in photographs . She was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years , a fun loving happy young woman . Her love of Albert was the essence of true love , and even if you only count the number of children she bore ( 9 ) , they must have had a passionate relationship . All of this is well borne out in the film . To this end , the cast has been well selected with both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend giving sound performances as Victoria and Albert.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT ) The historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did Prince Albert get shot while defending Victoria . There was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together , but nobody was struck by the shot / s . I also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between Victoria 's mother and Sir John Conroy . It is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for Victoria 's distaste for both her mother and Conroy . I also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as erring on the romantic , or at least having the potential to become romantic . He was already in his late 50 's when Victoria came to the throne , and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era , the movie portrays Melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to Prince Albert . There were apparently rivals to Albert , but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life , and Albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case.<br /><br />All in all I have spent worse times at the cinema , and brownie points with my wife ca n't be a bad thing either .
1 Who knew ? Dowdy Queen Victoria , the plump Monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband , Prince Albert , actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days . ' The Young Victoria ' not only chronicles the young Queen 's romance with her husband - to - be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.<br /><br />The Act I ' set - up ' draws you in right away . Following the death of Victoria 's father , the Duke of Kent in 1820 , less than a year after Victoria 's birth , the Duchess of Kent eventually hooked up with former Army Officer John Conroy , who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen - to - be . Conroy insisted that Victoria be raised under the atrocious ' Kensington system ' , rules designed to prevent the future Queen from having any contact with other children while growing up . What 's more , Victoria was forced to sleep in her mother 's bedroom everyday until she became Queen.<br /><br />The film explains that in 1830 Parliament passed the Regency Act , which established that Victoria 's mother would become regent ( and hence Guardian ) in the event that Victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor . During this time , the Duchess and Conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making Conroy her private secretary and treasurer . Strong - willed Victoria would have none of it , and refused to go along with Conroy 's and her mother 's nefarious plans . The Duchess disliked King William as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the Monarchy ; the King felt the Duchess disrespected his wife . As a result , the Duchess attempted to limit Victoria 's contact with the King . In an over - the - top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history , the King berated the Duchess at his birthday banquet , stating that it was his goal to survive until Victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.<br /><br />King William kept his word and died a short time after Victoria became eligible to accede to the throne . Victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of Conroy , whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable . They were both banished to a secluded apartment in Buckingham Palace and for a number of years Victoria had little contact with her mother.<br /><br />'The Young Victoria ' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding Victoria 's coronation as Queen . A good part of the film deals with Victoria 's relationship with Lord Melbourne , the Whig Party Prime Minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was . In the beginning Melbourne gains the young Queen 's trust and they become good friends . In the early years of her reign , she sees Melbourne as a progressive , but later loses respect for him somewhat as he 's revealed to be a typical politician , hiding his contempt for the masses whom he 's supposed to be championing . In reality , Melbourne was more a father figure to Victoria , but the film hints at some sexual tension between the Prime Minister and Prince Albert , as though they were romantic rivals.<br /><br />The plot thickens when Melbourne is forced out and the Queen must commission Sir Robert Peel , of the more conservative Tory party , as the new Prime Minister . The film chronicles the events of ' The Bedchamber Crisis ' in which Peel resigned after Victoria refused to replace some of her Bedchamber ladies with the wives of Tory politicians . The film leaves out another scandal which involved a Lady Hastings , one of the Duchess 's ladies - in - waiting who was accused of having an affair with John Conroy and becoming pregnant by him . Because of her hatred for Conroy , Victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about Hastings ' alleged pregnancy . As it turned out , Hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor . Victoria 's inexperience shows during the Bedchamber Crisis but the film 's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the Hastings Affair.<br /><br />The rest of the ' The Young Victoria ' deals with -- of course -- the romance between the Queen and Prince Albert . Victoria kept Albert waiting , as the film makes clear , since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new Sovereign . They spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until Albert returned to England and gave Victoria support during the trying times of the Bedchamber Crisis.<br /><br />I find a good number of parallels between Prince Albert and Prince Philip , the current Queen 's husband . While Philip is mainly Danish , he went to school in Germany and had in - laws who were of German background . Both Albert and Philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the Court ( there 's a great scene where Albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for King George III even though he had been dead for years ! ) . Albert 's struggle was the same for Philipas husbands of Monarchs , they had to find something to do . Both Albert and Philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they did n't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever - popular wives.<br /><br />Fortunately there 's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where Albert infuriates Victoria with what she perceives as his ' interference ' in her affairs . Albert does n't want a second ' Bedchamber Crisis ' so he goes over his wife 's head and arranges a compromise involving Victoria 's bedchamber ladies . Victoria is barely talking to Albert when an assassin 's bullets almost cuts them both down ( in the film Albert is shot in the arm but this never happened!).<br /><br />The performances in the film are uniformly excellent , especially the principals , Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend . The Young Victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography ( no mention of Victoria 's depression after Albert 's death ) . But ' Victoria ' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson .
1 Just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty could n't go anywhere , we are given a treat , a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by Emily Blunt , a marvel in the leading role , Paul Bettany , Rupert Friend , Miranda Richardson , and Mark Strong , as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of England 's most powerful monarchs . " The Young Victoria " dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power.<br /><br />Emily plays the queen , with a good combination of raw strength and innocence , someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand , but who possesses enough confidence to move forward . She is able to portray Victoria , as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand.<br /><br />Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown , and even when she takes command of her new position , she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course , the right support . Luckily for Victoria , there is Albert , a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate . There is amazing chemistry between the two performers , and there 's little doubt what the outcome will be , but there is the figure of Bettany 's Prime Minister , a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her.<br /><br />Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl . Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development , but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt , an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances . In here , she is given the breakout role of her career , a real life historical figure , who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time . She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years . She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes.<br /><br />"The Young Victoria " is not a royal epic portrayal of England 's ruling class . It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them . In the end , the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction . In here , there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far , and there is of course , a good old fashioned love story .
1 With all of the films of recent , dealing with the British Monarchy , is it really time for another ? Answer : YOU BET ! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from Britain dealing with the Royal family . In this case , it deals with the early life of Princess Victoria , and events leading up to the Coronation of her becoming Queen of all England , as well as her romance & eventual wedding to Prince Albert . The film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both England 's Queen & Prince , as well as several other events that transpire ( political turmoil , etc . ) . Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth , while Rupert Friend is her beloved & best friend , Prince Albert . The rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of Miranda Richardson , as the Dutchess of Kent , and the always welcome on screen , Jim Broadbent as King William , as well as a cast of others that shine on screen . Jean Marc Vallee ( C.R.A.Z.Y.,Loser Love),directs from a winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes ( Vanity Fair , Gosford Park , Separate Lies ) . I absolutely went out of my head over the film 's visual look ( by cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker),who gave each frame of film a painterly look ( with the help of production designer , Patrice Vermette),as well as some tight editing ( by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner ) . What I also appreciated in Fellowes ' script is the use of a game of Chess , as a metaphor for some of the film 's political motivation ( the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a Chess board ) . This is smart , well written , directed , filmed , edited & acted entertainment ( and enlightenment)that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema . Rated PG by the MPAA for a few scenes of sensuality , some brief violence ( a little bloody , although nothing too gory),a rude outburst of language , and some on screen smoking
1 THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings , solid direction by Jean - Marc Vallée of stalwart Julian Fellowes ' version of the youthful lass who was to become England 's longest reigning monarch - Victoria . Much of the early portion of the film , that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother ( Miranda Richardson ) and Sir John Conroy ( Mark Strong ) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations . But once Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) the film blooms . Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the ' child queen ' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) . But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert , and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert . The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert 's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe ! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend . A solid if not transporting epic . < br /><br />Grady Harp
1 I really thought that this movie was superb . Not only is the history correct , but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate . I was a fan of Emily Blunt 's portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth . Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous ( perhaps infamous ) for . The romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of Albert.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well . I appreciated the beautiful score , which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story . I also considered the cinematography to be outstanding , some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict.<br /><br />There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009 's best !
1 A new side to the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean - Marc Valle . Most people 's cursory thoughts of Queen Victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning . Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective . She portrays Victoria in her youth , ascension to the throne , and early years . Blunt 's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film . Her strongest scenes are with Albert ( Rupert Friend ) and Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) . All the actors acquit themselves well including Miranda Richardson in what could of been a throw - away role.<br /><br />Though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic " acting " moments , the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing . There are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing , the film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period . The set design and costumes are outstanding.<br /><br />This film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history , period dramas , and of Blunt and the other actors . Heartily recommend.<br /><br />Grade : A
1 when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008 ) , but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this would n't just be a solid movie . Almost everything in this movie is great , the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.<br /><br />The only thing that really let me down are the performances . Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada ) is the star of the film , bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance . Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt . Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him . Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.<br /><br />To me the film feels like unfinished . Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script , i do n't know but that 's how i feel about the movie.<br /><br />But overall it 's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt .
1 I have watched this movie on DVD a couple of times now , the first time , I watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour . an engrossing entertaining film , thank god no kiera knightley in it , refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make . Nothing bad about the movie at all , no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing . Might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
1 It 's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that 's based on the life of any number of British monarchs . Just take a well respected British or Australian actor , make things look pretty , and you 're guaranteed a formula for Oscar success.<br /><br />The Young Victoria is no exception , getting just about everything right , the cinematography striking and beautiful , with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics . Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally soar in , the film begins with Victoria 's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) . As the young Victoria herself laments , she 's moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of Britain 's most influential rulers.<br /><br />While this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory , it is the development of Victoria 's relationship with Albert that makes the film slightly more interesting . I confess : I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era , so I 'm a bit attached to these figures . Despite their many flaws as rulers , Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people . They left their legacy in the arts , in public health and education , and in Victoria 's conservative views and mourning culture after Albert 's death . But these things are only briefly hinted at during the film.<br /><br />It is fairly well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love , but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages . Even if it did occur behind the scenes , their 's was certainly one of the best known . Blunt and and Friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice , the proper mix of restraint and desperation . It 's a different love , not usually shown on screen , especially in this sort of film . It 's encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field.<br /><br />But we do n't get to see that love enough . While the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings , it does n't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high . Also , without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair , things feel a bit in limbo , superficial instead of intimate , and sometimes confusing . It 's not as big an issue during the film , but afterward , the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched , despite the perfect performances by the leads , most noticeably Blunt who even captures the famous monarch 's expressions.<br /><br />For as much as it tries , Victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic .
1 I just saw this episode this evening , on a recently - added presentation by one of our local independent channels , which now presents two episodes each weekday.<br /><br />As the gentleman opined in the other , previous comment here , I agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series , but I find it entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />My father was a friend of one of the principals ( in my hometown , Cincinnati ) , for whom young Rod Serling had worked in the media there -- and I remember Dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there . Overall " Twilight Zone " is certainly one of the true classics in television , and given its production during the height of the Cold War period , provides not only a view of this era in the country , but also ( today ) a nostalgic picture of production techniques , creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago.<br /><br / > * Minor " spoiler."*<br /><br />This particular story depicts , as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere , a story where the locale is meant to provide a " surprise " ending . Sometimes the characters are on earth , from elsewhere , while the story at first implies at least one is an " Earthling . " These usually contained the message ( as here ) of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this Cold War period.<br /><br />Viewed today , stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4 - 5 decades ago , and still provide some food - for - thought . -- as did this episode.<br /><br />While the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads , it still presents a simple , important message , and a worthwhile 20-some minutes of entertainment and interest .
1 I watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white TV . I remember my father remarking that " this is how it could have happened - Adam and Eve . " I vividly remember the scene when Adam finds Eve , her eyes were blackened . I asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry . Having not seen this episode in 45 years , I still remember it vividly - the TV transmissions back and forth with the home planet , scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters , with the final scene of the two walking off , Adam carrying his pack and Eve following . It may not have been a theatrical work of art , but it certainly left an impression on me all these years .
1 I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad / happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting . These I got . What I was n't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence . Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />If you did n't notice , watch it again , paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets , the terrain he 's driving through , the reactions people give him , the kinds of discussions he has ( one of the first is about pregnancy and children , one of the last is outside of a cemetery ) . The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context , as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount . The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death , and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife , in which he achieves the desired reunion.<br /><br />I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention .
1 Perhaps more than many films , this one is not for everyone . For some folks the idea of slowing down , reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell . For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists , some part they long for contact with.<br /><br />I suppose it 's a function of where I am in my own life these days , but I count myself in the camp of the latter group . I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic , gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological . This is indeed a journey story , a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.<br /><br />Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth 's presentation of Alvin Straight , though I 'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us . Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure . I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people , not just for " acting " but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.<br /><br />Given the realities of production economics , I 'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly . An outsider to film production , I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression " time is money " is so accurately descriptive . Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed , and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story -- he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality . No simple task , that.<br /><br />If you 'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself , you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story . And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night .
1 This is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie Lynch stuff . Rather , it 's for those who either appreciate a good story , or have grown tired of the run - of - the - mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah - ish " This is such a wonderful movie ! You must see it!"-semantics ( tho ' she IS right , for once!).<br /><br />The story unfolds flawlessly , and we are taken along a journey that , I believe , most of us will come to recognize at some time . A compassionate , existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.<br /><br />Acting is without faults , cinematography likewise ( occasionally quite brilliant ! ) , and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.<br /><br />A warm movie . Not excessively sentimental .
1 I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent , style , and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he 's become known for in the past decade . As much as the film is G - rated , it 's pure Lynch in style , pacing , and tone . The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.<br /><br />The cinematography is terrific , as is to be expected from a Lynch film , and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking . It 's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly , kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either " good " or " evil".<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast , most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher , and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.<br /><br />With this film , David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80 's with ' Blue Velvet ' and ' The Elephant Man ' . Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as ' Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me ' and ' Lost Highway ' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH , and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film ' Mulholland Drive ' , considering the high praise it 's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.<br /><br />'Straight Story ' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I 've ever seen . It 's a loving story about family , friendship , and the kindness of strangers . I would highly recommend it .
1 " A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love " describes this odd David Lynch film . This was especially " odd " because it was n't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years . Those were dark and shocking films ( Blue Velvet , Wild At Heart , Mulholland Drive ) and this is the opposite . I know it disappointed a lot of his fans . Others were delighted by it . Count me as one of the latter , and I own all three of those " dark " films , too.<br /><br />This was another supposed - true life story , here detailing an elderly man 's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he has n't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies . Well , I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an " odd " film of sorts , so Lynch stays in character with that ! < br /><br />Richard Farnsworth plays the title role . He is the type of guy , face - wise , voice - wise , low - key personality - wise , that just about everyone likes . The wrinkles on his face tell many a story . It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.<br /><br />The first 25 minutes of this film is n't much , and not always pleasant as it shows the main character 's adult and mentally - challenged child ( Sissy Spacek ) and her tragic past , but once Alvin Straight ( Farnsworth ) begins his trip , the story picks up . I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up , but I am more generous with it . I think it 's a hidden gem . To them , it was a sleeping pill.<br /><br />I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story . It IS slow and if that 's okay with you , you might like this . Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way , such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble . ( Henry Cada as " Daniel Riordan , is a standout in that regard . ) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing , but that 's a joke : he 's only in the final few minutes of the movie!<br /><br />The Iowa scenery is pleasant . I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil . It 's a nice state with nice people .... like this movie .
1 Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex , violence , bad language , special effects , and so on , my b.s . detector goes off . Usually , a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who do n't want anything to surprise them , but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk . So when David Lynch 's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews , I was apprehensive , especially since I was not a fan of his other " uplifting " story , THE ELEPHANT MAN . For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film , it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.<br /><br />I need n't have worried . THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one . Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part . There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without , and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much , but those are only quibbles . There 's no heavy - handed message , no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions , and no condescension towards us and its characters . Instead , they depend on the story to build its own power , and it does , so by the final scene , we are genuinely moved.<br /><br />Of course , casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part . He really is someone who looks like he 's lived through a lot but still perseveres , and except for those homilies , the desire he has to get back together with his brother does n't seem overly sentimental , because you can sense here is someone who 's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long . And he knows his time is running out , so he wants to make some peace , not only with his brother , but with his life . Sissy Spacek also does fine , unmannered work as Straight 's daughter . And although I am a city and suburban boy , the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot , making me want at least to visit some day .
1 It takes patience to get through David Lynch 's eccentric , but-- for a change-- life - affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight 's journey , but stick with it . Though it moves as slow as Straight 's John Deere , when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging , the painful regrets and secrets , and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation . Richard Farnsworth caps his career with the year 's most genuine performance , sad and poetic , flinty and caring . And Sissy Spacek matches him as his " slow " daughter Rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad . Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family .
1 After seeing this film I feel like I know just a little bit more about the USA . David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and weird for weirdness sake , and indeed these elements are not missing from The Straight Story . However it is in a light that I have not witnessed from Lynch before . We begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that can not be apparent from their introduction . Especially moving was the bar scene with two WWII veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions . If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune , do n't look here . But if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you .
1 The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America . At one level a slow walk through the heartland , it 's kind inhabitants , and amber grain , at another level about growing old and remembering what is important(and actively forgetting what is n't ) . David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence . A remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come .
1 Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother , could possibly be good cinema ? I certainly did n't . I thought I knew what to expect : one of the most boring experiences of my life . Well I was as wrong as I have n't been wrong too often yet , because this is one of the best , most realistic and honest Hollywood films I 've ever seen ... <br /><br />Giving a short resume of " The Straight Story " is n't very difficult . It 's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke . That 's already special on itself , but what makes it even more special is the fact that he has n't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument . In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems , but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life . Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks , not knowing if he will reach his goal : seeing his brother again before it 's too late ... <br /><br />I can easily understand why there are people who do n't like this movie and that 's also the reason why I will not say that these people do n't have a heart or things like that ... This movie has n't got any flashy action scenes , it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no , you do n't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either , because there is n't any . But why should you watch it then ? Well , the simple answer is the story . I have n't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio 's ( that 's right , the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense ) makes it even more special . I 'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it , probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.<br /><br />Some people will argue that the story is very shallow , but I really do n't agree with that . Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and do n't want to think any further . If you look close enough than you 'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong , that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too , so they wo n't make the same mistake . If that is n't deep enough , how much deeper does a story have to go for you then ? < br /><br />I would also like to add that this movie really had it all . Some beautiful landscapes ( finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York , Chicago or some other big city ) , some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth , Sissy Spacek , ... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie . I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie would n't be to my taste . It 's one of the very best movies I 've seen in a long time . This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull 's eye . I give it the full 10/10 .
1 Upon The Straight Story release in 1999 , it was praised for being David Lynch 's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal . Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere ' 66 mower , at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct . Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch 's trademark motifs coming through.<br /><br />Lynch 's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks , but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down . The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating . Incredibly significant , this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.<br /><br />The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing . For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point . Almost universally acclaimed , the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism , that it was n't a typical Lynch film . " Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G - Rated story that is n't his own . " Brundage claims , with his protagonist Alvin Straight " quoting lines directly from Confucious . " He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse . Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film . Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead , Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore , The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible . If you are a Lynch fan , it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.<br /><br />The narrative is slow and thoughtful , which gives you a real sense of the protagonist 's thoughts as he travels to his destination . Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife , children and his brother . Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks , which only adds to the effect , which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents . The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch . The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti , makes me yearn to go to America . The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent . His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he did n't win . Regardless , however it is probably the finest swan - song for any actor . < br /><br />So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch 's complex narratives or trademark dialogue , the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended !
1 David Lynch 's ( 1999 ) film of John Roach / Mary Sweeney 's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time well before the film 's eventual release.<br /><br />We come into the life of Alvin Straight ( Richard Farnsworth ) late on in life . His medical condition is poor , his life is mostly behind him and he knows it.<br /><br />This makes what he decides to do , even more remarkable and endearing . He decides ( and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions ) to put a few things straight.<br /><br />Alvin is , by this time in his life , a man of great experience but modest means . His daughter Rose ( Sissy Spacek ) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience 's behalf . But it 's worth it , because Rose 's story can not help but come out as the film progresses.<br /><br />This film is the story of a journey . But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense . Early on in the film , we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey , which no elderly gentleman of Alvin 's age should reasonably undertake.<br /><br />But along the way , we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective . His objective is very simple and straightforward . His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him . He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.<br /><br />Along the way , Alvin meets many people . The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film . We come to know who Alvin Straight is , from what Alvin Straight does . And at the end of the film , we know who we are .. better .
1 This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen : I glowed inside throughout the whole film . The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen . The slow pace was set by the mode of travel ( a riding lawn mower with a big trailer ) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow - paced lives of the other characters.<br /><br />The story actually happened ; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 . There was no acting ; everything was completely real , as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters . Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead , always wanting to do the right thing . Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight , a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother , Lyle , who has had a stroke . Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.<br /><br />The film underscores the importance of family to this man and , hopefully , to all of us . I eagerly anticipate seeing it again , and again . Directed by David Lynch , this films proves his directorial skill . Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor ; at 79 , he was the oldest nominee ever for that award .
1 David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way . They are interesting to look at and think about but they really do n't gel in your mind . Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.<br /><br />The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film . Not that there 's anything typical about them anyway . It 's an odyssey through rural America . A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house . He rode 300 miles from Laurens , Iowa to Mt. Zion , Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.<br /><br />At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth . He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way . The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin 's slow journey toward realization.<br /><br />Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl . She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation . After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.<br /><br />Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car . She complains that she has killed several and leaves . Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.<br /><br />Later Alvin 's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him . A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed . They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter , nicely played by Sissy Spacek , whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past . Alvin insists on paying for the call . The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure . Alvin declines with thanks.<br /><br />While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls . Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.<br /><br />Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who 've repaired his lawn mower . He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs . He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.<br /><br />The night before Alvin leaves the man 's yard he takes his hat off to him . The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him . This scene is perfect in it 's simplicity . It 's heartfelt because it 's so straight , so real.<br /><br />The journey continues and we ca n't help to get more and more involved with it . We want Alvin to get to his brothers . We want him to make amends . We want to know this world is full of forgiveness.<br /><br />This was Richard Farnsworth at his best . It was his last film and his performance was amazing . You ca n't help but to understand his pride , to listen to his wisdom , and to ultimately feel his pain . One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in.<br /><br />If there 's justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight , his brother , and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar . I can picture them discussing their lives , regrets , hopes , and joys . As Alvin says in the film , " My brother and I used to look up at the stars . " Well , I know they all are with the best view in the house .
1 The Straight Story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line . He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he ca n't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself . The film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way . < br /><br />Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast , most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter , and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.<br /><br />At first I felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but I soon discovered that Lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie I would recommend to anyone .
1 [ No Spoilers]<br /><br />Being a David Lynch film , one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do . But it is a very straight story as the title might hint . Do n't except to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i.e. Lost Highway . It is a simple film but it is indeed a great film . That is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect . It 's innovative because it so not Lynch . But maybe that IS Lynch . He likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself . Being a very avantgarde director , he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he does n't give it to them . That would be crafty.<br /><br />The pace of the film is slow . I would almost say lawn mower speed ... Do n't expect an action orgy , but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film . Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment . Look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life . And listen to Badalamenti 's score and the main theme that really animates the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes shown frequently . < br /><br />Farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film , making him one of the most likeable ol' men ever depicted on film . He does n't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts . His cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination . Need I say that his weak health in this film was n't acted ? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete . That knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to Farnsworth . < br /><br />All of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done . One could ask for homilies that are n't that obvious and a bit naive but it does n't ruin the overall picture , being that it is a memorable motion picture . 9/10 .
1 It 's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings . Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple , yet nice , daughter to Robert Farnsworth,<br /><br />who finally , in his last role , gets to show what a fine actor he was . It is hard to believe that this is a David Lynch film . It is slow and even , sweet and moving . One of the best unless you like car chases , sex scenes , and violence .
1 " The Straight Story " is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight , who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged , dying brother . But that 's just the basic synapsis ... this movie is about so much more than that . This was Richard 's Farnworth 's last role before he died , and it 's definitely one that he will be remembered for . He 's a stubborn old man , not unlike a lot of the old men that you and I probably know . < br /><br />"The Straight Story " is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives . It will reach down and touch some part of you , at least if you have a heart , it will .
1 Well , it definitely is unlike anything else directed by Lynch . No supernatural stuff , no violence , no profanity . Nevertheless , it is a beautiful flick . It 's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it 's the story of an old man 's 6-week(that 's my best guess for its duration ) journey . The characters are everyday people and thus , they are believable . The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching . Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it . Lyle and Alvin do n't even have to say anything . For a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten .
1 MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch . He 's a modern genius , because he 's not only a film - maker . His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen . So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me , with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets . Still , Lynch is there , and , while this is far from his best , it 's a film not to be missed . Late Richard Farnsworth 's performance is one of the reasons.<br /><br />8/10
1 Always fancied this film from the video cover . Eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film . A simply stunning performance from all of the case and it 's filmed so beautifully . Even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is , as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale . It 's really moving , frequently amusing and very watchable . Not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout . A 9/10 from me . A must see .
1 On paper , this movie would sound incredibly boring . The idea of a 75-year - old man traveling the country - side on a riding mower certainly does n't have much appeal to it , but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence . Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than " The Straight Story." < br /><br />The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl . She 's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out . Alvin tells her a story about his own kids , long ago . He had them each take a stick and break it , which they could easily do . Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them . " That bundle , " he said , " is family . " So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger . " The Straight Story " realizes that we 're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />Alvin 's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un - Hollywood character interactions . Each interaction is full of warmth and humor , and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we ca n't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother , Lyle , who has suffered a stroke . And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey . It 's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets -- to their benefit and ours . It 's a slow , simple , relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we 've lost with the urbanization of America.<br /><br />"The Straight Story " is the rare live - action " G "- rated movie that truly should not be missed . Grade : A
1 Like his early masterpiece " The Elephant Man " Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight , simple story without losing his artistic touch . This is a true story of an elderly retired man ( expertly played by Richard Farnsworth ) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death 's door . A beautiful score from Badalamenti , exquisite photography of rural life ( love those aerial corn - field shots ) , and a sly director 's hand that reveals man 's basic humanity , this is a beautiful slice of life film . Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep , but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end .
1 Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch 's works is his most accessible . This time , rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares , Lynch provides a reflective , fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both . The simple true story of an Iowa farmer ( Richard Farnsworth ) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged , stricken brother , there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes ( some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland , filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis ) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable . Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way , allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life , and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter ( whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney ) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances , one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson , whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time . But that 's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best . To those unfamiliar with Lynch or know him only by his violent , disturbing reputation , this is an excellent place to begin ; for those who know his work , this is one of the finest in his repertoire .
1 I was watching this movie at one of my usual time , which is real real late at night . Usually if a movie does n't interest me , I start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake.<br /><br />At first I thought that 's what I had to do since this movie 's pacing started off slow , along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time . But after a bit , I start getting more into the movie , as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling . By the end , you feel like you 've known him your whole life . The movie kept my interest so much that I did n't even know the sun was about to rise.<br /><br />Not much of Lynch 's bizzare style , but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing .
1 If it 's action and adventure you want in a movie , then you 'd be best advised to look elsewhere . On the other hand , if it 's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood , check out " The Straight Story." < br /><br />Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight , in this true story of Alvin 's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke.<br /><br />Farnsworth is perfect in this role , as he travels his long and winding road , making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way . The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower , but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching , waiting for the next life lesson Alvin 's going to offer.<br /><br />Stretch out on the couch , relax and enjoy . It 's the only way to watch this very good movie , which rates a 7/10 in my book .
1 This , I think , is one of the best pictures ever made . It 's so pure and beautiful . It really touched me . I 'm glad David Lynch proved that a film does n't necessarily need SFX , a twisting , complicated plot or flashy images . Way to go , Dave . I 'd like to see Cronenberg do that !
1 Lovely piece of good cinema . This is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why . Well , one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today , and he is able to film emotions.<br /><br />When you are watching the film you can feel what Mr. Straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his " marvellous " John Deere . What changed in his mind ? , what changed in YOUR mind when you watched this film?<br /><br />A beautiful fraternal love story .
1 This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen . I am not a religious person , but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience . One suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life.<br /><br />I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was sceptical . I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal . But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go . It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie , but then I was completely lost in it . There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie ! I left the cinema feeling that I had truly learned something valuable about life.<br /><br />This is not a typical David Lynch movie , and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years . On the other hand , I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because I also thought he managed that very well in The Elephant Man . Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is his best yet . 9.5/10
1 The zenith of two brilliant careers . David Lynch , better known for less accessible material , crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise . A man travels to see his estranged brother . Having no other means of transportation , his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower . Richard Farnsworth , in his last film , delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role . Achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things , Straight Story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed . Sissy Spacek is notable as Farnsworth 's daughter , an impaired middle - aged woman living with the loss of her children .
1 The only show I have watched since 90210 ! Why did they discontinue it ? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all ! The least they should do is release it on DVD ! < br /><br />I checked out similar shows , but nothing has come close . The cast had incredible chemistry and I looked forward to each episode with much anticipation . < br /><br />They made a big mistake by pulling that show . If anyone has any info regarding where I can obtain a DVD of North Shore please post a few lines here . Thanks ! Aloha !
1 I 'm sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it ; after all it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii . With the cast , the location , style of the directing and its publicity  shows women walking around on the beach and all that . No wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it.<br /><br />It was wrong of them to do that . Cause after I decide to watch the show , there are actually more thing going on , real juicy story and conflict , turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much  addictive.<br /><br />The story of the hotel clerks , the manager , the owner and their complicated love life . Also enter the troublesome hotel 's visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel . It actually more exciting than it sounds here.<br /><br />I wo n't deny that the acting suck but it ai n't that bad that you 'll look away . The story is not so consistence but good enough . The soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time . I took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience.<br /><br />Recommendation : I Really Do Enjoy Watching This . Zillion Times Better Than Expected.<br /><br />Rating : 7.5/10 ( Grade : B)<br /><br />Please Rate My Review After Reading It , Thanks .
1 i LOVED IT and was SO shattered that there not making another season ! ! ! i wish they would ! it was the best show ever ! ! ! ! ! ! there 's probably not any chance of them deciding to not cancel the show is there ! ha ha i wish there was though ! i would be so so excited ! ! i really would ! I miss it ! and was especially shattered not to know what happens to Jason ! ! i think they should make another one .... it i also think its silly that u have to writr ten lines to post a comment .. it makes your comment drag on .. and no one will read it ! ! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole ... maybe they could make a spin off ! !
1 I do n't see how this show is like the OC at all . < br /><br />First of all , the OC centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life . North Shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time . Second , The OC takes place in California . North Shore takes place in Hawaii.<br /><br />And why would Fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network ? I think this is a great show with good actors for the most part . It has a good storyline and plot . I like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out . The most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out . It was n't predictable like most stories on most shows . < br /><br />I hope Fox keeps it on the air .
1 It is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest , if any , without his presence.<br /><br />Despite a not outstanding direction - in fact , there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly - , a seemingly low budget , a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points , the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end.<br /><br />I have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance , even Paul Scofield acting in " A man for all seasons".<br /><br />Actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if Fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to Church by performing a crime.<br /><br />"Je suis Maurice Morand , prètre catholique " ( " I am Maurice Morand , a catholic priest")is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end.<br /><br />The other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich Morand - who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest - consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into Christ´s blood.<br /><br />Gérard - the man that wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret . He does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine.<br /><br />In next scene , the dialoque between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable . " Do you carry away men too ? " asks Morand , who hates himself for what he has just done . " That would be too much work " is the smart answer.<br /><br />The rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time.<br /><br />I think that " Le défroqué " is a very strange film , but has to be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history.<br /><br / >
1 A priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained.<br /><br />This movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures . In post war France it is also about the mortal aspect of Faith itself.<br /><br />This may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion . Besides , Pierre Fresnay is sublime .
1 There are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted to act in it.<br /><br />I think , just the opposite , that , even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses , the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent.<br /><br />His performance is probably the best in history.<br /><br />The film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret.<br /><br />For somebody who does not believe that a priest  even a defrocked one  can convert it in Christ 's blood , the scene is perhaps bizarre . But for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework , it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant.<br /><br />The scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking . But it is very well acted . Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of his character , the tortured defrocked Morand who , in this terrible way , comes back to his duty .
1 Unlike other commentaries , I found this film fascinating , even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors.<br /><br />Being a technologist , I found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic . Although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic , experiments are being conducted now to do just this . I will note that this experiments are in a very early stage , with results so far not favorable.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are well cast . The girl , although overacting a bit , looks suitable dumb . The truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers . The minister conveys doubt at first , ( The principal investigator tells the minister that him ( the minister ) , is not sure whether he believes that God created man or that man created God . But the minute when the chips are down , he falls back on his faith . Only the PhD plays the zombie . The secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters . In the face of death they react as real human beings would.<br /><br />The movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government . As strictly a thriller , the movie does not have enough thrills . As a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating .
1 I thought " The River of Souls " was a very good Babylon 5 movie , with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen , Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane . If this were an episode of the series ( without the humour ) it would probably be one of my favourite stand - alone stories of the series.<br /><br />Personally , I 've always preferred Scoggins to Christian , although granted JMS did n't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the Byron / Telepath plot . If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the " poorer " actors in those scenes , then this movie is solid stuff . Probably my third favourite of the four movies , but in no means bad at all .
1 An excellent film with great performances from Zack & Lochley . Much to their displeasure ( & mine ) Garibaldi arrived on station . ( All due respect to Jerry Doyle but in Seasons 4 & 5 I lost sympathy for the character . ) It does n't take him long to start criticizing Zack ( who I love best of all on the show)and taking charge . I 'm sure Zack could have coped . The Soulhunter plot is fascinating , especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does . The humour supplements it nicely . 10/10
1 Well I gave this movie a 7 . It was better than " Thirdspace " but not as good as " In the Beginning " as far as the B5 movies go . I really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal . Let 's hope the producers and cast get the next series " Crusade " up to the standards of B5 .
1 Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs , but with clever dollop of suspense . Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a broken - down bus on its way to nowhere , but which passenger is it , ( talk about your illegal immigrants ! ) . All - star supporting cast , from wild - eyed Jack Elam ( hamming it up shamelessly ) , to sexy Jean Willes ( if she 's the Martian , then I say let 's open the borders ! ) , to cruel - faced John Hoyt ( the most obvious suspect ) , along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips ( and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver ) . Makes for a very entertaining half - hour even if the action is confined to a single set .
1 After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed in a frozen wood , two police officers find evidences that the event really happened and apparently one Martian had walked away from the spot . They drive to the nearby Hi - Way Café and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting the reopening of a snowed in bridge . However the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus . While interrogating the travelers , weird things happen in the diner , with the lights switching on and off and the turntable turning on and off . When the passengers are released and the bus follows his travel , one passenger returns to the diner and discloses a plot of invasion of Earth.<br /><br />"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up ? " is one of the best episodes of this great series . The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogs , funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the very end . My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " O Marciano " ( " The Martian " )
1 Rod Serling was , of course , a genius and his wonderful , playful , creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development . There are no such shows now , but rather " Housewife " sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher , or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high - tech screens.<br /><br />Jack Elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that I ca n't help but think that Rod Serling was tailoring that long ago week 's show around Elam , even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story . This episode ends with a twist , as usual , but shock and humor are mixed with especially " Serlingesque " dexterity.<br /><br />Rex Lewis Field
1 This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone , with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments . There 's the usual blond vamp " dancer " ( what is up with Serling 's fondness for that kind of character , such that she keeps showing up in various episodes ? ) and other assorted characters , but it 's Jack Elam 's " old man " who totally steals the show . I consider this the funny , light - hearted version of " The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street " -- or , perhaps , a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of " The Thing . " On another note : I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things -- he looked familiar -- but it seems that " Ron Kipling " disappeared after just two TV credits to his name .
1 A bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm . The police have closed the bridge -- saying it 's unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared . However , after a while , their boredom is turned to concern , as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may just be an alien ! ! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low - brow way.<br /><br />This is another of the fun episodes of The Twilight Zone . Instead of the typical twists or social commentary , this one features no lasting message . However , it 's also very and watchable , so who cares ? ! Exactly WHAT occurs you 'll just have to see for yourself.<br /><br />By the way , this one stars John Hoyt -- a face most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies . In almost every case , he played a real grouch ( like Charles Lane during the same era ) , but boy did I love seeing him -- as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time .
1 One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes . And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd . and La Brea , my father and I , and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle ! Barney Phillips , but no hat on -- at least , I do n't think he had a hat on.<br /><br />We asked him about his third eye , and he said something like he left it at home , and everybody he met that day had asked him about it.<br /><br />A friendly guy . We used to see all kinds of character actors in LA in those days.<br /><br />BTW , I was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the " three hands " on the other alien ! < br /><br />Robyn Frisch O'Neill < br /><br />Hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963 .
1 In a series chock - full of brilliant episodes , this one stands out as one of my very favorites . It 's not the most profound episode , there 's no great meaning or message . But it 's a lot of fun , and there are some fine performances.<br /><br />But what makes it really stand out for me is that it is , to my knowledge , the * only * Twilight Zone episode with a * double * snapper ending . The Zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story . But this time , you get a surprise , and think that 's that , but it turns out there 's * another * surprise waiting . I just like that so much , that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes ( the other being a deeper , more message - oriented one ) .
1 A fey story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth . ( Things must be pretty bad back on Mars . ) Two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported UFO crash . Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracy 's Pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner.<br /><br />The diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning . Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge . The bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus , although he did n't notice who they were . The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the journey to be resumed . One of them is an alien , but which one ? All of them are suspect . There 's the crazy old man ( Jack Elam ) , of course , who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit . There 's a blustering businessman who must get to Boston ( John Hoyt ) . A young couple on their honeymoon . ( Execrable performance by the husband , Ron Kipling . ) Except for the couples , nobody has noticed anyone else . And even the couples are suspicious of each other . Bride to newly minted husband : " I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin . " The story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason , the lights go on and off , the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously.<br /><br />It 's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle . There is no discernible " depth " to it . It 's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens . It 's not a warning of any kind , just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses.<br /><br />I always enjoy it when it 's on . It 's especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman , knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman Senator who masterminded the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGM 's version of Shakespeare 's play . And here he is -- with three arms.<br /><br />Oops .
1 I have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many IMDb users ( Some are saying it 's his ' worst movie ever . ' What ? ? Have n't any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave ? ) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid , and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on . Duh ! What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie ? Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story , then just loaded it up with action ? Of course not ! Black Mask is awesome , wall - to - wall action throughout nearly it 's entire running time . It 's also deliciously gruesome , and we get plenty of severed limbs , decapitations , and creative ways of watching the bad guys ( and quite a few innocent people , too ! ) get slaughtered . Most of Li 's other martial arts films are nursery - school when compared to Black Mask ; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence , bloodshed , or action sequences whatsoever ! And that made me a happy camper . Again : if you go into a Jet Li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot , you are going for the wrong reasons . Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movies ( though , beware of the horrendous dubbing ) .
1 In Stand By Me , Vern and Teddy discuss who was tougher , Superman or Mighty Mouse . My friends and I often discuss who would win a fight too . Sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix . But now it seems that we discuss guys like Jackie Chan , Bruce Lee and Jet Li . It is a pointless comparison seeing that Lee is dead , but it is a fun one . And if you go by what we have seen from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask , you have to at least say that he would match up well against Chan . In this film he comes across as a martial arts God.<br /><br />Black Mask is about a man that was created along with many other men , to be supreme fighting machines . Their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose . They are invincible in some ways . Now that is the premise for the film , but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />Jet Li is a marvel . He can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do . And that is what makes watching him so fun.<br /><br />Besides the martial arts in the film , Black Mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that Jet has with his co - star , the police officer . They are great together . But to be honest . if anyone is reading this review , they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department . And the answer to that is a resounding YES ! ! ! Lots and lots of gory mindless action . You will love this film .
1 I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds . But this movie I enjoyed , mostly because I 'm used to the usual HK action films . Most of the films like this are do n't watch it for the story line , watch it for the mindless action . And mindless action is right . You get to see Jet Li Jump , spin , kick , punch , shoot , make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets . It 's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 . That is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped . Most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a North American film . But you need to remember most HK film budgets are n't nearly as high as a North American film , and the style in a HK action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them . If you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.<br /><br />My rating was an 8 .
1 The story would never win awards , but that 's not what it 's about ... the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes . Who needs a story with fighting like that ? Really , it 's worth watching for that reason alone . IF you can handle the gore , of which there is a LOT ... none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at . I gave it a 7 .
1 Anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie . The fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping , who also did the fights in The Matrix . And the fight scenes are somethin.<br /><br />Li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain , who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ( ya got me ) . When other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade , Li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them.<br /><br />There are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie ( one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices ) . The fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches ; the body count is way up there . Li has seldom been better , and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars ( Yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier ) . Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord ( no suprises there ; he makes a cameo in every HK movie ) . It 's unfortunate they do n't make action movies like this in the US ; I would n't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that I crave so much . Recommended .
1 This film appears to draw a borderline - on one side , those who love it , on the other , those who find it unbearable.<br /><br />To begin with , there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not " getting " . Of course jet Li 's Mask looks like Bruce Lee 's Kato - he 's supposed to , it 's a joke . The guy who has a time - bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous ? of course , it 's a joke ! Some readers will probably ask , if this film is supposed to be so funny , why all the excessive and gory violence ? well , for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different , from culture to culture ; and while Hong Kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme , it 's certainly only slightly more than average for a HK action film.<br /><br />Also , Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre 's conventions and pushes them to extremes , simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic . After decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds , many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch spurting blood all over the place . But the fact is , when you 're shot with rapid metal projectile , it 's almost certain that blood will spurt , especially from an artery.<br /><br />This film is a Chinese comic book movie . It is true that the Spiderman films never get this gory - but if they were faithful to reality , they would be ! Well , despite its comic - book origins , this film is faithful to reality.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the flashy , over - stylized filming and editing . If the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to Hollywood - style nostalgia ( as , e.g. , The Rocketeer , or the recent Sky captain film ) , I doubt anyone would have found it offensive.<br /><br />But as it stands , I still had a lotta fun watching this movie .
1 I ca n't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li . Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice . Anyway , Black Mask is n't terrible , but it certainly is n't great either . The final fight sequence is well staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix . But the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing . ( I 'm begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions . More focus on Li 's fantastic physical skills were in order . Black Mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows Li 's skills .
1 In Black Mask , Jet Li plays a bio - engineered super - killer turned pacifist , who has to fight against other super - killers . Bad plot , bad sfx(60 million dollar budget ) , but the fighting scenes were excellent ! Jet Li is the greatest martial - arts star alive !
1 This is a very strange HK film in many ways . First , many of the action sequences really are n't that much fun . The very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly . Not cool silly , or even funny silly , but just silly . That 's not to say there are n't some great action scenes , but most simply do n't come up to the level of some of the other films I have seen . The opposite side is that this film actually has CHARACTERS , not just people . All of the main characters are interesting ( except for the head bad guy , who is flat as a billiard table ) and most are fairly well acted . All the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch . The dialogue is quite witty , and does n't seem to lose much in translation . This film is worth seeing , but I hope that uninitiated American audiences do n't think this is the best HK has to offer .
1 This film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire Hollywood films of this sort . This film is produced by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li . This team has brought you many worthy Hong Kong cinema productions , including the Once Upon A Time in China series . The action was fast and furious with amazing wire work . I only saw the wires in two shots . Aside from the action , the story itself was strong and not just used as filler . To find any other action films to rival this you must look for a Hong Kong cinema outlet in your area . They are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint .
1 What more could I say ? The Americans totally hated it because the U.S. cut was so bad , although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it.<br /><br />Talking about the U.S. theatrical release(along with the newly released Blu - ray Disc version ) , it 's faster and tighter than HK cut , the background musics were all changed from the dark , grim HK musics to Hip - hop musics ; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out . Though , the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor 's voice and tone . But , the problem is Hak Hap(Black Mask ) the movie was designed and meant to be dark , grim , super - disturbing and totally gruesome . Very unfortunately the U.S. release just skimmed the cream they wanted , which in return completely changed the movie 's undertone(HK release was rated 18 + ) to be even more comical and amateurish.<br /><br />Now let 's talk about the original HK release . This movie is like a hidden gem , a prototype for the whole " matrix " tide and era . The fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit " old - school " among HK movies . However the style the movie created was a unique blend of Kungfu and pop culture . With all the leather , black costumes and decorations , this movie features a batman - like superhero in a black mask against a run - of - the - mill gang of multinational super - soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss . Yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child , but it works . It 's so impressive that the whole movie 's gon na give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats . In year 2002 they made a sequel which had a PG-13 rating , but without Jet Li and Liu Qing Yun . And you know how bad that was because Li and Liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship . And , did I happen to mention Francois Yip ? Her roundhouse kick was totally cool , even cooler than the villain boss because she did n't use a stuntman for all the fighting . Did I mention she was also smoking hot ? Anyway , there are a lot of things to like about the movie.<br /><br />However , the movie also suffered from a lot of problems . First off , it 's a mediocre script made at its best potential , which means this production team deserved a better screen - writer . There are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far - fetched and do n't totally make senses to the audiences(US version was even worse because all the character developments were cut ) . Anyway , you ca n't ask too much out of a comic - inspired action movie . Also , this movie is entirely improper for children . I wo n't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old . It 's saturated with disturbing contents including blood , gore , sado - maso costumes , extreme brutal violence and so on . Along with the style of the movie , it can be called a wet dream for heavy - metal rock music fans and action fans . ( the U.S. cut was milder , but if you want to see it , see the HK release for what it is . ) 7/10 . Status : inspiring , hidden , undervalued , adult .
1 OK , it 's not a perfect movie by any means but I disagree with the overall IMDb opinion that it 's really really bad . I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990 's and loved the era dearly . I never saw ' Black Mask ' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time . Apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my DVD copy did n't give me the option to turn off , the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong movies during this time . I still stick to my guns in the opinion that , when it comes to action , these guys , no matter what their budget , add an element of magic to the screen no Bourne Supremacy , Casino Royale or Mission Impossible ( I 'm not knocking these movies - I just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated ) will ever achieve . What is it ? It 's the feeling that the film - makers were experimenting as they shot and edited , not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time . For me , this makes watching movies , all the more fun and dangerous .
1 Very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee .Li is excellent as the low key librarian / cop who saves all time and time again . He has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you do n't mess with .Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage , she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that I found unforgettable .The villain , the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but I ca n't find his name in the credits , can some one help me out with that ? Thanks ! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask , in any language its good entertainment !
1 Now let me tell you about this movie , this movie is MY FAVORITE MOVIE ! ! ! This movie has excellent combat fighting . This movie does sound like a silly story line about how Jet Li plays a super hero , like Spider - Man , or etc . But once you 've seen this movie , you would probably want to see it again and again . I rate this movie 10/10 .
1 Hak hap(Black Mask)is what I 'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions . Sure the plot has been tried and heard before , ( A biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force are n't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist , and a librarian . But when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police -his best friend is a cop- he becomes the black mask . ) the style that the movie goes for , very visual , works and at least for me is entertaining . I love martial arts movies that are a spectical . People flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop . But that is what this movie is about anyway right , a showcase of Jet Li doing what he does best , and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills , which to say the least are top notch . As with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala . Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time , these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats . But I must say , even with the large holes left in the plot ( like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape ? Who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment ....... ohh well suspension of belief I guess ) , the movie to me stays interesting . It is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter . But still all around a great high paced action movie .
1 This movie is rich with action and gore . The story line is strong enough to support the action sequences . The English version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable . This movie ranks among my personal favorites next to " Hard Boiled " ...
1 It 's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the US . I found it through a rare video dealer , and it was certainly worth it . This is , without a doubt , the best film made during the pre - code era , and the finest film of the 1930s . Masterful director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the Depression , and with MAN 'S CASTLE he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era.<br /><br />Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them , and they help make this movie a wonderful romance . Young 's Trina is sweet and hopeful , while Tracy 's Bill is gruff and closed - off . The dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult , but in the end rewarding relationships on film.<br /><br />MAN 'S CASTLE is the most soft - focus pre - code film I 've seen . Borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter 's village where Bill and Trina live into a palace . The hardships of the Depression are never ignored , in fact they 're integral to the film . But as Borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale , the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh . It makes the film warm and affectionate.<br /><br />MAN 'S CASTLE is the crowning achievement of the pre - code era . If only more people could see it .
1 As other reviewers have noted , this is an unjustly neglected Depression - era film . Directed by Frank Borzage ( two Oscars ) and written by Jo Swerling ( Leave Her to Heaven , The Westerner , Lifeboat , etc . ) , it is a tough - minded , well - structured and -realized move about denizens of a New York City shantytown . They 're grifters , beggars , and women forced into prostitution , but they 're a community of people both good and bad , with loyalties as complex as any group's.<br /><br />Perhaps primary among this movie 's many admirable qualities is the contrast between Spencer Tracy 's character , Bill , and Loretta Young 's Trina . He tough - talking , physically aggressive , and evidently fearless-- but Bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival . While he blusters , Trina actually hangs tough ( if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike ) . Her devotion to him is obvious , and complete . When she becomes pregnant , she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave , or " I 'll even give up the kid if you 'll only be happy . " Such is the dignity of Loretta Young 's performance ( at age 20 ) as a quite simple character , that she seems neither weak or dependent , but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it , and wants nothing more .
1 This is very dated , but that 's part of the charm with this 1933 movie . You can say the same for most Pre - Code films ; they 're just different , and usually in an interesting way.<br /><br />It was the short running time , the great acting of Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young 's character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy - but - intriguing film.<br /><br />You'd be hard - pressed to find a nicer girl than " Trinna , " played by the 20-year - old Young who was already into making her 50th movie ! ( She started acting as a small child . That , and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days . ) The camera , although in soft focus throughout much of the film , zoomed in on Loretta 's face and eyes many times and I was mesmerized by her beauty.<br /><br />Playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life , Tracy 's " Bill " slowly transformed into a loving man , thanks to Trinna . Spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting.<br /><br />Although they have small roles , supporting actors Walter Connolly , Marjorie Rambeau , Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75-minute film . I was particularly fascinated with Connolly 's role as the minister / father figure of the camp.<br /><br />The story is a little far - fetched but - hey - that 's the movies . This story is about two lonely Great Depression victims trying to survive in a " Hooverville "- type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale .
1 Man 's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called ' Hoovervilles ' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration . The proposition of this film is that a man 's home is still his castle even when it 's just a shack in a Hooverville.<br /><br />Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much . But in a part very typical for Tracy before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco , the start of a slew of classic roles , he 's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young.<br /><br />One of the things about Man 's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men . Women had some additional strains put on them , if men had trouble finding work , women had it twice as hard . And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal . Spence takes Loretta Young in who 's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle . Pretty soon though they 're in love , though Tracy is not the kind to settle down.<br /><br />The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man 's Castle . And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage . Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously.<br /><br />Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp , Marjorie Rambeau who 's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl , a really loathsome creep who has his eye on Young as well . Hohl brings the plot of Man 's Castle to its climax through his scheming . < br /><br />Man 's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression , not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment .
1 Though I like E.E. " Doc " Smith 's books and David A. Kyles books of Lensman , the anime , which is loosly based on the books , is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair.<br /><br />Though the story may seem familiar to Sci - Fi / Fantasy buffs , such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family , it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless . Plus , Lensman was THE first Animated motion picture to use hand drawn and CG animation all at once . Sure , it may look a bit outdated now , but it is still an innovation . If it were not for Lensman , none of that would have ever happened ( personally , I think Computer Graphics look better in animation that live action.)<br /><br />Too bad they only released it on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the worls ( mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different ) . I just wish they release the Lensman movie and tv series on DVD / VCD in EVERY part of the world , not just certain parts.<br /><br />P.S. Worsel rules ! I just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well .
1 Lensman is a rather lesser - known Anime gem from Toho and MK studios . It 's loosely based on the novel , but it reminds me more of the game " Metroid".<br /><br />If you want to see this , see it in Japanese with Subtitles or just plain Japanese . The English dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to death.<br /><br />There is not much new , despite the fact that it 's the 1st animated feature to combine CG - graphics with hand - drawn animation , but it 's fun to watch , nevertheless .
1 People do n't seem to be giving Lensman enough credit where its due . A few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the Lensman experience.<br /><br />The Year : For the year it was made in ( 1984 ) Lensman features some of the most stunning effects I 've ever seen . As a person who watches a lot of early 80 's animation Lensman is unique in it 's use of what appears to be computer - generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive . Kim 's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this . Every time I watch that I have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made.<br /><br />The Soundtrack : Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that I 've heard , and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film . Lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine . While the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx , the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of Chris . It 's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when I was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there was n't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point.<br /><br />Western Influences : Helmut - sounds like " helmet " and has roughly the same voice as Darth Vader . Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers . Takes over Han Solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise . Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka . The lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach Christianity at the audience than in the original SW . While the force relied on belief far more than concentration , the lens is a pure concentration tool . Theoretically , anyone could wield the lens . The lens is far more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive / offensive weapon.<br /><br />Technology : The boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships . They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white . The idea of a DNA weapon was nice if only it had been developed . The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers ( or whatever it was called - that 60 's series where they were battling the Xylons ) . There were n't enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second Lensman film.<br /><br />Finally a note on Worzel . This character is a unique and very interesting character - design who fortunately continues on to the second film.<br /><br / >
1 " Secret of the Lens " is perhaps a pretty campy all - time favorite of mine . The best and funniest from Kajawari Yoshiaki , who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai - ecchi anime . I wish he did more campiness like this.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence , the parts where Lord Helumis blows up his failing henchmen , the party riots that Bill causes ( one of the funniest scenes ) and whenever my favorite character , Worsle appears.<br /><br />Check this out.<br /><br />WARNING : This is not for serious sophisticated Anime fans !
1 A SHIRLEY TEMPLE Short Subject.<br /><br />It can get mighty rough at Buttermilk Pete 's Cafe when the local contingency of diaper - clad WAR BABIES come in for their midday milk break.<br /><br />This primitive little film - a spoof of military movies - provides a few chuckles , but little else : tiny tots talking tough can begin to pall in a short time . Shirley Temple , playing a duplicitous hip - swinging French miss , has n't much to do in this pre - celebrity performance . Highlight : the real signs of toddler temper when a few of the infants unexpectedly get well & truly soaked with milk.<br /><br />Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two - reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
1 I love these " Diaper Baby " movies ! You could n't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history . It is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh , which it does . How they ever got these kids to " act " I 'll never know . I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30 's . You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young , the stock market had crashed , the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world . The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension , but then dinner for 25 cents is too . It was a different time with a totally different mind set .
1 I myself feel this film is a rare treasure . Not only is it the beginning of Shirley Temple 's career , but a rare look on how our society has changed . You have to understand , certain things we today would view as sexual , back then would be considered innocent . For example , the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie , saw this as just children mimicking adults . Most people did n't think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive , other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls . To them it was n't sexual . Mind you this was before we had internet , TV , etc ... Most sex crimes were n't openly brought up . Occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the " funny uncle . " But that was often all that came of it . Yes very sad . But it is kinda sad today , for even I too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended , innocent and funny . When I saw Shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her , yes I felt disturbed . I have to remind myself the time this took place ! Those children did n't know what sex was . The parents knew that , both those of the children in the movie and those watching it . The thought may not have even entered their minds . In the eyes of the average adult back then , this was no more sexual then if Shirley was playing house . Even today kids will enter beauty contest , many dressed up extremely maturely , for a three yr old . However the child is merely pretending . I do n't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult . Or the old movies that display this . In all honesty , our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong . This sometimes can be for the best . But I truly believe this movie is n't one of them . It gives a rare look of an innocent mentality , that we have long lost .
1 While browsing the internet for previous sale prices , I ran across these comments . Why are they all so serious ? It 's just a movie and it 's not pornographic . I acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it . I 've shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it too . I feel privileged to own this original 1932 8 mm black and white silent film of Shirley before she became popular or well known . After reading the other comments , I agree that the film is " racy " . Big deal ! I only wish it was longer . It seems that I must be the only person who owns one of these originals , for sale at least , so I wonder how much it 's worth ?
1 This is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released , and probably the most popular one , is a spoof of the 1926 silent film What Price Glory.<br /><br />I watched this and I do not understand the kiddie - porn that is being claimed . It is just a cute little film . I have seen family shows that I grew up watching in the ' 80 's and ' 90 's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a ' mature manner ' . It was more provocative because they WEREN'T dressed in diapers . There 's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes . ( just a joke ) I read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this . That is sick . To me , if you watch this and are bothered by it , then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you . It is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film . All of the B.B. films were parodies , nothing more . The parodies / spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language . Should n't those be more appalling ? I can watch those without issue , but they sometimes take children 's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies . That is what should get under your skin . Not that they babified ( not a word , I know ) an adult movie from 1926 , because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC those silent films were , huh ? Not to mention those ' Forbidden Hollywood Pre - Code era films ' so vile and filthy . They would NEVER make such filth today ? ( note the sarcasm )
1 A nice Shirely Temple short . Child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time . Perhaps being " seen and not heard " needed to be made up for . Aside from that this is fun . Given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing , from a social viewpoint , that strike me as both very progressive and liberal . I wo n't go into those here , I 'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements . As early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple . That makes it worth watching if you 're a Temple fan . For others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you 're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove .
1 So many educational films are nothing more than mind - numbing drudgery , saved only by the fact that " MST3 K " mocks them ( " Why Study Industrial Arts ? " comes to mind ) . " Hemo the Magnificent " is actually quite well done . It 's all about blood , the heart , and the circulatory system . I admit that I do n't remember everything from it , but it does a good job explaining everything , keeping it serious but entertaining . I guess that you can always count on June Foray ( most famously the voice of Rocky the Squirrel , she plays a deer here).<br /><br />Since " Hemo the Magnificent " itself may be hard to find , probably the best place to see it is in " Gremlins " : a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming .
1 A Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE film.<br /><br />Keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of hardworking HEMO THE Magnificent.<br /><br />In the mid-1950 's , AT&T and Bell Science teamed with famed Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the Universe around them . A far cry from the dreary black & white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars , the Capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye - catching visuals shown in Technicolor . The four films - OUR MR . SUN ( 1956 ) , THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS ( 1957 ) , HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT ( 1957 ) , THE UNCHAINED GODDESS ( 1958 ) - quickly became schoolhouse favorites , where they were endlessly shown in 16 mm format.<br /><br />The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter ( 1896 - 1982 ) , an affable English professor at the University of Southern California . This avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor , genially imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring . Dr. Baxter , who won a Peabody Award for his achievements , continued making high quality instructional films after the Capra quartet were concluded.<br /><br />HEMO THE Magnificent , which was produced , written & directed by Capra , relates the story of the human heart and blood circulation system , using animation and gentle humor . Film star Richard Carlson appears as the Fiction Writer , energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell Hemo 's tale.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production crew , and the voices of Marvin Miller , Mel Blanc , June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters , all uncredited.<br /><br />The devotional Scripture which begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor & tone of the production .
1 By God , it 's been a long time since I saw this . Probably about 18 years ago?<br /><br />The movie tells us ( kids ) all about human blood and the circulatory system . Very professionally put together -- Disney - style animation , plus human actors -- it was directed by Frank Capra , for pete 's sake!<br /><br />Kind of an overkill . I wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film - strip 's worth of information on the human body ? But boy will those kids watching it learn : even now I can clearly remember Dr. Baxter being challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood , to which the Doctor immediately answers " sea water . "
1 This was a delightful presentation . Hemo ( blood ) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity , arrogance , snobbish superiority and innocent wonder . The quote ( or scene ) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of " all this plumbing ... you have n't learned my secrets at all " and threatens to storm out , the Scientist answers him in a single word " Thalassa " -- salt water which horrifies the Fiction Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood . < br /><br />Such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released . Stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning .
1 I remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and REALLY enjoying this . I recently had the opportunity to watch it again , for the first time since then , as it was aired on " Walt Disney Presents " on the Disney Channel . I 'd forgotten most of it , and some of it was geared towards kids , but it was still enjoyable . I ca n't wait to show it to my niece and nephews .
1 LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I 'll see a better one this year . This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia . Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car ( a Lada ! ) for him . To do this the son has to break the record opening doors . What the father actually wants his for his son to be someone , because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called L'Espoir ( Hope ) . Of course nothing works out as planned . This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki 's DRIFTING CLOUDS , although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker . Just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat , without being unrealistically happy . The humour is absurd , without making the plot unbelievable , and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial . The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde . This actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult - classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben . Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands , because , as he said in an interview , he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the Ben character . With his return to a leading role in LCA there should be no doubt anymore about his acting . He 's simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery , but smart enough to realize what he 's done and be torn by remorse about it . A must see .
1 This is an absurdist dark comedy from Belgium . Shot perfectly in crisp black and white , Benoît Poelvoorde ( Man Bites Dog ) is on fine form as Roger , the angry , obsessive father of a family in a small , sullen Belgian mining town . Roger is a photographer who , along with his young daughter Luise , visits road accidents to take photos . He is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son , Michel , must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him . Michel dresses as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called ' Cinema Lies ' , where he describes mistakes in films . Luise is friendly with near neighbour Felix , a pigeon fancier . Roger is a callous figure as he pushes Michel right over the limit during the record attempt , which almost results in his death . Interspersed throughout the film are Magritte - like surreal images . It 's undeniably charming and well worth your time .
1 Some critics found this film bleak , but for me there was enough good humour and optimism to overcome this impression . For example , the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still centre of the film , often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and plotline.<br /><br />The film is full of original ideas and characters , and the final outcome is not predictable : I felt it could 've gone either way.<br /><br />By the way , many reviews I 've read mention the effective use of black and white , but the print I saw , shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia , was in full colour.<br /><br / >
1 It 's wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exerting international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS : the vague class identity above working but well below middle , the unhinged father , the abandoned urban milieu , the sense of adult failure , the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life . < br /><br />But if Meadows is an expert formalist , Mariage trades in images , and his coolly composed , exquisitely Surreal , monochrome frames , serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter , which , Meadows - like , veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds . < br /><br />There are longueurs and cliches , but Poelvoorde is compellingly mad , an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions , whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous ; while individual set - pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions ; the best marriage sequence since THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY - manage to snatch epiphany from despair .
1 Diego Armando Maradona was , and still remains as the best football player , the game has offered . Not just an athlete , but an artist . This documetary if the 1986 World Cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world . Because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal , which he scored against my own country(england ) . There 's absolutely no point of diminishing this star . Although I do nt undersand spanish , I can appreciate the argentine narrator . He actually cries of happiness , and can barely express his emotion ..... Anything I wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend , but readers ..... you have to watch this to know what I mean .
1 This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art . What strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed . Besides following the play like a TV broadcast , there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games . This brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory . Today 's TV broadcasting style , so different than that of 1986 , is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.<br /><br />The players are not the only stars . The audience , the referees , the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history . In this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way . In that regard , today 's TV broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality , although it is now much closer than before.<br /><br />There are several highlighted players : Maradona ( Argentina ) , Elkjaer and Laudrup ( Denmark ) , Francescoli ( Uruguay ) , Platini ( France ) , Lineker ( England ) , Rummenigge ( Germany ) , Butrague#o ( Spain ) , Socrates ( Brazil ) , and Sanchez ( Mexico).<br /><br />This movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of Mexico 1986 , although most of them are well covered . Across all the movie , there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams , even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves . This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.<br /><br />Because of what happened because of referees during Mexico 1986 , much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely Maradona - biased . Much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen , that they are as human as the players , and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other . Soccer rules do not allow referees to use TV based replays to make decisions , so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive . As a consequence , referees play an active part in the development of a game . Their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.<br /><br />The sequel movie for the 1990 World Cup , compared to this one , is just a source of bitter disappointment . Much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game , whereas this movie tells things from a more distant , unbiased point of view .
1 Diego Armando Maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup at home . He was already the biggest star , and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football . Everybody had begged Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy genius , but the manager thought that he was not yet ready.<br /><br />History records that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup fairly convincingly - they had n't really needed Maradona . The same was not true in 1982 . Spain was a catalogue of disaster for Argentina . Menotti - still chain smoking - played Diego this time , but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy . Maradona had signed for Barcelona on June 4 1982 for around $ 7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the Camp Nou and Belgium beat Argentina one - nil . It was not an auspicious debut , and even though he scored twice against Hungary in the next match , Maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir - a crude , petulant foul on Brazil 's Batista in the Second Round that abruptly ended his tournament and Argentina 's reign as world champions.<br /><br />But now that was all behind him . Maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at Barca , and left in 1984 to join Napoli . It was as if he was finally home . The Neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice Maradona to poor , underachieving Napoli . Gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the Camorra 's millions as part of the transfer fee , and the city was determined to make him feel at home . So , for the time being at least , Maradona was El Rey - he brought his Argentine side to Mexico as one of the favourites , and with a new manager - Carlos Bilardo replacing Menotti.<br /><br />Maradona is the hero of this story , a one - man World Cup winning machine . In 1982 , hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the Falkland Isles ; now the British press yearned for a rematch ( with the same result ) in Mexico City . Maradona was still regarded with distinction in England , remembered more for a superb performance in Britain during a 1980 tour than for Spain . But he was still an Argie : the enemy.<br /><br />England actually started well , and Lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes . A key event happened on 8 minutes . Fenwick , the big and limited English defender , was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area.<br /><br />After a tense first 45 minutes , the second half started with a bang . Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes , but could find no way through . Similarly Valdano 's attempt hit only white shirts . Then the moment of infamy that serves as Diego 's epitaph . Hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area , Shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but there was Maradona , somehow rising above the English goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net . How had he done it ? Simple : handball.<br /><br />The most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion . Every spectator waited for Mr Al - Sharif of Syria to blow for the foul ( he did n't ) . Shilton looked and appealed to the linesman - he ran back to the centre circle . Unless he assassinates the Pope , or becomes the first man to step foot on Mars , when the great man dies this moment will be shown first - in long , lingering , slow motion , followed by the look of glee on his face . The next image will be his next gift to the world - the World Cup 's finest goal.<br /><br />Burruchaga stroked the ball to Maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half . He span , and accelerated away from Beardsley and Reid . This was the real Diego - he burst through Butcher and attacked Fenwick . Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack . Normally , he would have aimed his boot somewhere near Maradona 's thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card , but who cares ? Then Fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated , and decided to run at Maradona waving his arms - perhaps he was trying to put him off ? Diego shot into the box as Fenwick fell over . Butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement . Shilton charged out in panic , and Maradona twisted around him and prepared to score . Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the Argentinean - instead he gave extra impetus to the shot , which smashed into the goal . England were coming home.<br /><br />During this magical Mexican summer , the world had found a successor for Pele . In fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed - Pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970 , but had had great players all around him . Maradona did not . 1986 was his World Cup .
1 Of all the football films I have watched , this is one of the 2 best . The other being fever pitch . But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup , Diego Maradona . This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful . The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic . This story is not about the individual games of the world cup ; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil ( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein . The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein . highly recommended . A classic of world football . to be watched over and over again , esp if you 're a Maradona fan .
1 I really really love this show ! I have always liked the 1990 's shows of Space Ghost ! This show was hilarious and I ca n't believe why Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like this off the air . I hope they put this show on DVD or something . The show is about Brak ( from the Space Ghost cartoons , SGCC and Cartoon Planet ) who lives his every day life with his Mom and Dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot , Zorak ! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice does n't give him any money that Zorak made from singing at all . Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak did n't finish their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework did n't exist ! Another episode I like is the one where Brak 's Dad and their next door neighbor , Thundercleese the Robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm . Another episode I liked was the one where Zorak makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand . I also like a lot of the other episodes ! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is getting beaten up , blasted and zapped !
1 Leave it to Braik to put on a good show . Finally he and Zorak are living their own lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast . I have to say that I love both of these shows a whole lot . They are completely what started Adult Swim . Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 . It may not have been platinum , but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love Adult Swims shows . I have to say that out of all the Adult Swim shows with no plot , this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made . That is why I like it so much , it is just such a classic in the Adult Swim history . I believe this is just such a great show , if you do n't like it . Hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it .
1 " The Brak Show " is good .Probably not in the same level than " Aqua Teen Hunger " or " Space Ghost Coast to Coast " , but definitely it have many brilliant moments .Basically it follows the life of Zorak and Brak that have normal lives and go to the school , living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 ' sitcoms . The humor and the animation of this show it 's very much as " Aqua Teen Hunger " ( and in one episode you could see Meatwad ) with bizarre situations and strange characters .But it is good , it have funny parts . Some of the songs are great , others not very much but I like this show . The funniest character is the father of Brak . ( that is a human , nobody knows why )
1 Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other . Morgan Freeman is superbly human , relating with one and all , while Paz Vega is the edgy cashier behind the " 10 Items or Less " check out line , intimidating customers and bored out of her mind . Together they explore , discover , and learn from each other . To do that of course they must be vulnerable , interested in change , and have a sense of humour , all of which they both have . I wish this film was realistic , I wish this type of story happened more often , I wish we did n't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds . The film 's message is based in the open heart , and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there - a world where peace could be a possibility .
1 This movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season . It celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness . Morgan Freeman plays a character very like Freeman himself -- a successful actor pushing 70 . He has traveled to a small , rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play , as a manager of such a place . He soon beguiles the staff and the customers , especially the lovely , if cranky , young woman ( Paz Vega ) who presides over the " 10 items or less " checkout lane.<br /><br />10 Items Or Less does n't have a big statement to make and does n't pretend that it does . It follows Freeman and Vega as they become friendly , and as the older man offers his counsel , in exchange for a ride home -- the movie - company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and Freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he ca n't call for help . I had a little case of the blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this flick cured what ailed me .
1 I 'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman . ' The Shawshank Redemption ' ranks at the top of my all - time favorite movies . But I have to admit that I have often wondered about his choice of roles . So many of his titles were big budget clichés with no heart . ' 10 Items Or Less ' for me marks the return of Freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents.<br /><br />Freeman plays an unnamed , formerly big time Hollywood actor who has n't worked in several years . He has been offered a part in an unspecified indi picture for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in LA . After being stranded there by his flaky driver , Freeman is offered a ride home by checkout girl Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) , whom he has semi - befriended . Before she can take him home , however , Scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to , and Freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride.<br /><br />The movie follows Scarlet and Freeman to several locations , but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two . Freeman is the quintessential disconnected Hollywood type who has n't heard of Target , and does n't know his own telephone number or even what day of the week it is . He spouts wisdom from the Dalai Lama filtered thru his ' the whole world is but a stage ' mentality , and repeatedly calls Scarlet 's job interview an ' audition ' . And yet he has a way with people , a way of affecting them that extends beyond his fame . He is a fan of humanity . He studies them , asks incessant questions about them , and delights in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed . In Scarlet , he sees the stubborn , proud loner that he was ; he sees the man he used to be.<br /><br />Scarlet , for her part , displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own insecurities about herself . Vega plays the role with a connection to Freeman that skates the line between an almost daughterly love and physical attraction , although she plays it beautifully and it 's not at all as creepy as it sounds . But even as she feels her connection to Freeman grow , Scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru Freeman 's Hollywood bull*hit with a sharp pragmatism that refuses to accept anything but the truth.<br /><br />The movie is smart , funny , and well written , with dialogue that is simple but effective . I read one IMDb review that said the lines were ' stilted ' , which I think is a misinterpretation of realistic human speech . There are no big soliloquies here , no deep soul searching moments . And so the trick is , I think , to show how people in ordinary , everyday life can forge connections with one another . And I think Freeman and Vega pull it off beautifully , painting a picture of a bond between two people that glitters like sun on the ocean , ethereal and elusive . Long after it 's gone it lives on in your memories , tantalizing you with what might have been . OK , that was a bit flowery , but I really did like the performances and the movie . I would definitely recommend it .
1 Full disclosure : I 'm a cynic . I like my endings sad and my hankies dry . I did n't cry when Bambi 's mother was shot . Will Smith 's new film Happiness looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar . Basically I was born without an artistic soul . < br /><br />So why on earth did I like " 10 Items or Less ? " Maybe it was the double espresso I downed before the show . Or ( more likely ) maybe it was that even the most hardboiled of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness . < br /><br />And sweet it is . From the moment " Him " meets " Scarlet " ( an event far from a Nora Ephron " meet cute " ) the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed . ( Aided beautifully by Phedon Papamichael 's cinema verity style camera work.)<br /><br />The main argument about the film is that it 's too far fetched . Is the film far fetched ? I do n't know . You tell me . I 've yet to meet Adrian Brody at the market . ( However , not for lack of trying ) . Do I enjoy considering the adventures that might occur should this momentous event take place ? Darn straight I do . . .that 's where most reviews of " 10 Items or Less " fall short . . .they fail to take into account that even we cynics have fantasies . And heck , sometimes , it 's worth the price of admission to vicariously live them , 82 minutes at a time .
1 10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer / director Brad Silberling , just a little film shot in Carson , CA that feels like the entire story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word . Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman , in between his big projects , with Spanish actress Paz Vega , and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years , scouting a location for a little ' filler film ' to get back into the flow of things . His ' role ' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters , among others , one Scarlet , the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line . Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job , she is also generally angry about her philandering husband ( Bobby Cannavale ) , currently sleeping with Scarlet 's lazy co - worker ( Anne Dudek ) , and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere . The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a ' road trip ' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story , simply told , but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well . This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message . It is well worth viewing , and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching , informative , and comic - a pleasure to view . Grady Harp
1 This movie is really genuine and random . It 's really hard to find movies like it in bunches of movies now in Hollywood . I really enjoy watching this movie , i bought its DVD Tuesday this week and i 've watched it for 4 times . I love the Spanglish accent of Paz , it s just really cute as she is . And her acting and Morgan 's are so funny and natural.<br /><br />My movie taste might be really different from others but i have to say i really love this movie , the simple is the best!<br /><br />I've learned something more about life from this movie ( well , or at least USA 's life ) ... life is really random ... Sometimes , u meet someone , they pass by your life and be your friends coincidently , and u do n't spend so much time with them , maybe just a while but u enjoy that ' ' while '' with them , and then u and them will never meet each other again , but the time u are together is really unforgettable . Just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories ... <br /><br />This movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap . I rarely can learn anything from movies , but this is an exception .
1 I do n't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless.<br /><br />What about just being entertained ? Something at which Morgan Freeman excels . He gets a chance to show off a bit . Paz Vega , his co - star , gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie.<br /><br />I thought it was a good movie . Some humor , some pathos , some bittersweetness but nothing over the top . I got an especial kick out of Jim Parsons as the receptionist at a construction company . When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says , " You make me want to be a woman . " He 's just hilarious . The fight scene between Ms. Vega her ex - husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too.<br /><br />In short , it 's a cute , charming film that will make you smile . You could do much , much worse .
1 A great , funny , sweet movie with Morgan Freeman ( who plays himself ) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film . I was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store I really started to enjoy the film . It shows how a positive attitude can change anything . It does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty cliché romance . It includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter . A very rare masterpiece !
1 Running only seventy - two minutes , this small , overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two - character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations . Taking place almost entirely in various , non - descript spots in southern Los Angeles , the story itself is inconsequential , but like Sofia Coppola 's " Lost in Translation " , the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly , find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter . It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters . Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big - screen specialty , Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self - indulgent movie star . His character is driven to a low - rent grocery store in Carson , where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film.<br /><br />Out of work for a few years , he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin , but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff . Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet , an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency . She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company , but her deep - seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already . Still looking like Penelope Cruz 's Amazonian sister , the beautiful Vega ( one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks ' execrable " Spanglish " ) brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet . She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story , which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target , Arby 's and a full - service carwash . Nothing earth - shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters.<br /><br />Silberling keeps the proceedings simple , but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael 's vibrant cinematography ( he lensed Alexander Payne 's " Sideways " ) and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto ( " City of God " ) . There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale ( as Scarlet 's soon - to - be - ex - husband ) and as themselves , Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman , as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill ( " Knocked Up " ) as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons ( the " knight " in " Garden State " ) as a worshipful receptionist . The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras , including a making - of documentary , " 15 Days or Less " , aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes ; six extended scenes ; a light - hearted but insightful three - way conversation between Silberling , Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target ; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD .
1 Reviewed at the Sept 12 , 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival . The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room.<br /><br />The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him , but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc . The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager . He soon discovers the real - life market is run by a iron - willed " 10 Items or Less " checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega . When Freeman 's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that 'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path.<br /><br />While the film was enjoyable , it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress . There were two extended musical sequences ( One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children 's songs in the car , one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video ) that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long.<br /><br />It 's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little . Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well , but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film.<br /><br />They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that . Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no ! ? In the real world it 's the exact opposite.<br /><br />Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits . The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious ! An early bit where Freeman 's chauffeur insists it is Freeman 's voice on a " Books on Tape " reading was also pretty funny.<br /><br />The director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief Q&A after the screening . Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there . Quite a compliment for both Silberling 's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it .
1 In all honesty , if someone told me the director of Lemony Snicket 's Series of Unfortunate Events , City of Angels , and Caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and that 'd it be real good , I 'd say that person must be joking . But that 's what director Brad Siberling did . And it was really good.<br /><br />"10 Items or Less " has a similar conceit to films like " Before Sunrise , " " Lost in Translation , " or more recently " Once . " It involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity did n't put them there , they 'd probably never cross paths , or if they did , they would n't say word one to each other . Like those films , " 10 Items or Less " focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other 's strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />The story involves Morgan Freeman , playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control , ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by Paz Vega . She has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary . Initially , Freeman 's character just needs a lift home . After spending time with her , however , he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice.<br /><br />Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between Freeman and Vega . The plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film 's 80 minute duration . Freeman has fun with his character , as he appears an outsider in lower class world that Vega 's character , Scarlett , inhabits . Vega , in the meantime , grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her life 's situation looking to move on.<br /><br />There a couple things that really stood out in this film . First of all , Siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and does n't fall into any Hollywood pitfalls . It 's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film . It works , even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable.<br /><br />I am also impressed with the performances . While Freeman 's presence gives this film credibility from the get - go , he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him . Paz Vega , meanwhile , is priming herself for a breakthrough in US film sometime in the future . I loved her in Spanglish and she 's equally good here as the tough , no - nonsense Scarlet . Towards the end of the film , she successfully conveys the growth of her character . I 'm looking forward to seeing her in more films.<br /><br />Overall , 10 Items of Less functions best as a character piece , well scripted and directed by Brad Siberling . He has n't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big Hollywood films . Yet there 's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he 'll take this road again .
1 Knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting , directing and acting . And it 's nice to see when a director / script get it right . Clocking in at just 82 minutes , 10 ITEMS OR LESS does n't stretch the story , trying to grasp at inane topics . It stays focused , being funny , sad , and well thought out.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman ( LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN ) stars as " Him " , an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him . We 're introduced to " Him " as he travels to a supermarket in an out - of - the - way section of town by The Kid ( Jonah Hill , CLICK ) . Realizing he has a star in his car , The Kid pressures Him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years . Him is n't very forthcoming because , not only has he been out of it for while , he 's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in ( " I have n't decided if I 'm going to accept the part . " ) . The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville . Stuck , Him decides to check out the local market . He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) who operates the 10 items or less register . Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent , Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role . He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.<br /><br />But Him does n't just use Scarlet , he helps her so he can see deeper into her life . They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband , and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she 's pining for , and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing . This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him , too , showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain - store retail world ( " These shirts are only $ 12 bucks ! How is this possible ? ! " ) The ending , as stated at the beginning of this review , is abrupt but apropos . There 's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond . They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other . It 's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet 's clunker car sits idling outside Him 's L.A. mansion.<br /><br />This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going . And it wo n't waste your time either .
1 10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those ' under the radar ' pictures that is drenched in the simplicity that most independent movies have : honest , ad hoc performances by its two leads -- Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who establish quite a complementary if unlikely duo . The great thing is , this entire movie looks improbable despite its ' road movie ' roots . How Morgan Freeman 's unnamed character psychically ( not physically)arrives to where he meets this jaded check - out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor ( who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role ) is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter -- two people on opposite sides of the coin of society -- is deceptively simple . So , in a nutshell , while there are n't any bang ! moments of Earth - shattering revelations , this movie is a quirky little mood piece that probably otherwise got lost in the shuffle of indies which came out in 2006 but deserves to be seen , if only for its honesty .
1 This is a splendidly done simplistic film that explores a theme , and gives each viewer something different that they take from it . The premise is simple : an unnamed celebrity actor ( Morgan Freeman ) decides to research for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people . He takes particular interest in the cashier at the " 10 Items or Less " lane ( Paz Vega ) , who he finds an amiable , strong , and curious presence.<br /><br />Both actors play off each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters in what is a character study . Not a conventional character study ; they each represent entire worlds . The cashier 's life is mired in a harsh and frustrating " real world , " while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantasy existence that he ca n't do simple tasks like remember phone numbers . He readily admits he 's putting on a face when he talks to people , and the whole point of researching real people shows he 's not one of them.<br /><br />But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work ; we see the reverse process as well . Several characters recognize " Him , " and make reference to how he has inspired them with his movie roles.<br /><br />The cashier 's favorite song " Al Pasar la Barca , " about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay ( ie : do honest work ) for boat passage , could n't have been chosen better . It parallels with the Vega character , the only store employee with any brains or ambition , who is willing to work hard to succeed . ( That 's quite an aspiration , for somebody who looks like Paz Vega . ) It 's an odd little film , probably made on a shoestring . If you do n't mind slow pacing and a " talky " approach , this film will entertain . The characters are perfectly contrasted , and the effective acting makes them endearing . A nice watch .
1 One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help.<br /><br />It all comes down to loving people . As Will Rogers said , " I never met a man I did n't like . " Of course , if you meet Paz Vega , what 's not to like ? That smile of hers can melt diamonds . She is just so fantastic that I can watch anything she is in . The same goes for Freeman . he is just magic on the screen.<br /><br />The two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish . From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy . It was tender , charming and just plain funny.<br /><br />You have to check this out .
1 Bravo ! Morgan Freeman is an actor , who researches a character he is selected to play , before he makes a commitment . Freeman is a ' good fit ' for this film ( like he was for " Driving Miss Daisy " ) , and he is not only believable , but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety . Although there are no guarantees in life , for anyone , this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out , in order to avoid getting stereotyping . And it must be said that stereotyping has hampered , or completely ruined , a significant number of acting careers.<br /><br />This is a low - budget film that , amazingly , was made in a time span of only two weeks . It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling . The location manager chose Carson , CA for the film 's setting , and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film . The editing is fair to good , but a little rough.<br /><br />Silberling was the ' subcontractor ' , in getting Freeman to do this film , while the actor was in - between film projects.<br /><br />There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega , a Spanish actress , and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members , who are diverse and come from different cultures . The film also encourages an understanding between people , who not only speak two languages ( English and Spanish ) , but come from two different worlds of ethnicity , race , gender , norms , mores , beliefs , folkways , principles , and values . The film strives for some honesty , and arrives at some truth , to maintain the film 's integrity.<br /><br />Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years . In truth , Freeman is so - in - demand as an actor that he is constantly working.<br /><br />The film offers an adventure of bonding , caring , sharing , changing , and exchanging . And , the film 's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role.<br /><br />If necessary , tell your boss that you 're taking a ' mental health day ' , and go see this film . If you 're able , take your significant other or your family with you . I rank the film a 10 out of 10 . It 's enjoyable , interesting , informative , poignant , and worthwhile .
1 It 's a difficult movie to classify " 10 Items or Less " . Generally , I do n't care about defining genres , but there 's something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category , in order to transmit , even with only one word , your feelings about it . I completely recommend this film to anyone and , if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life , you 'll want to do the same as soon as you 've finished watching it . < br /><br />I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it 's not perfect but it does n't do anything wrong . I do n't want to sound like I contradict myself , but I believe writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script . I 'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection : a product that would be as simple , appealing and uncompromising as its title . Well , he 's done it . < br /><br />Silberling , director of long , complex , dramatic movies like " City of Angels " and " Moonlight Mile " , proves with " 10 Items or Less " , which closes in at just 70 minutes , the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it . To put an actor ( Morgan Freeman ) in front of a woman ( Paz Vega ) in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what Silberling proposes here . < br /><br />I ca n't tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that should n't be underestimated . Because here everyone 's exposed : the camera focuses directly on the two main characters , who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that 's not endless only because life is life . And let me express how praise how well Silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches , in less time ( not only in movie duration time , but in the single day that the movie develops its events ) and in a smaller place , the kind of connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in " Lost In Translation".<br /><br />That movie , set in Tokyo , also encountered an actor and a woman , and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives . It 's in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of " 10 Items or Less " and , just as in Coppola 's movie , the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words do n't seem forced or included in the picture to ' buy time ' . < br /><br />In this aspect , the collaboration of Silberling and his director of photography Phedon Papamichael . The man who shot the beautiful sceneries in " Sideways " and focused on every emotion in " Patch Adams " , delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty . < br /><br />But the ultimate beauty of " 10 Items or Less " can be found in its cast ( by Avy Kaufman ) , in its two protagonists . They are the ones who transmit this feeling I mentioned at the beginning and I ca n't specify ; we feel their connection and we can tell they 're having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff . Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman , also an executive producer of the film , simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry , and one that 's well deserved : a quiet man , filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh . And the beautiful Paz Vega ( well , I said she was great in " Spanglish " )  Here she proves she 's the real deal , and Hollywood 's not small for her .
1 Not that much things happen in this movie but A lot of meanings . The woman thought she had all that she can in life , but that was indeed not true , and she found out herself when she met this person who was conducting some research for his next job . There really should be more types of movies like this , i m not even that old as considered " mature " ( i m 13 by the way ) and i still got the idea and point of the film . The main point is in my opinion : DON'T THINK YOU CAN'T HAVE A BETTER LIFE , JUST BECAUSE YOU CURRENTLY HAVE THIS ONE.<br /><br />Though I got to admit i was thinking of watching another movie but after reading all the reviews and seen the trailer i decided on this one even though i knew not that much action would appear in the film . I recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the film , and is a really good ending .
1 This is film - making at it 's simplest and it 's best.<br /><br />I had my doubts , because even though Freeman is great actor , sometimes he gets involved in bad projects ; this is not one of those times.<br /><br />It 's a small story that runs just over an hour and fifteen , in a time when we are getting used to having movies become longer and longer , and not necessarily better , the director uses the short time to his advantage , because the characters are so well defined from the start ( great portrayals by freeman and Vega by the way ) , that the little bit of background info on them seems real , Morgan is himself even though his name is not mentioned , he has been out of movies for a couple of years now because he was saturated by the business , and developed a fear to commit to a script , and is doing research for a character in a indie movie where he plays a store / supermarket manager . The story begins by him being drop of in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood , where he meets the cashier of the 10 items or less ( Vega ) and has to take a ride with her cause " the production " forgot to pick him up.<br /><br />In many ways it 's a road movie , Morgan provides the laughs , and quirks with his unbeatable smile and positive perspective on everything , showing off an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define everyone he sees into a character he could play , and Paz ( by the way , what an extraordinary beautiful woman , even more gorgeous than Penelope Cruz ) brings the vulnerability of a 25 years old separated woman who works harder than everyone else without getting any credit in a dead end job at a crappy supermarket.<br /><br />It 's a talkie , there is a lot of dialog , but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well sustained , the characters become so lovable right away that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for more screen time of this odd couple , but the shortness is in the nature of the story , so it was a good call from the director not to give in .
1 I have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie I was basically lost . There had been some mildly amusing humour , but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that I was wasting my time . Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this . There was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me . In fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie . It was as if I just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless - and that in its very pointlessness was its charm.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a “ little project ” to jumpstart his career . He 's going to play a supermarket manager , and spends the day in a neighbourhood supermarket to research the role . While there he meets and bonds with Scarlet ( played by Paz Vega ) - a cashier who wants more out of life . He helps her prepare for a job interview as if she 's auditioning for a role , while she introduces him to real life . It 's truly funny watching “ him ” ( for that 's how the character is identified in the credits ) be overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store.<br /><br />Freeman and Vega were great together , with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but father - daughter chemistry . If you feel lost at the beginning , stick with this . In the end , it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie . 7/10
1 I believe a lot of people down rated the movie , NOT because of the lack of quality . But it did not follow the standard Hollywood formula . Some of the conflicts are not resolved . The ending is just a little too real for others , but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining . Even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting , the directing also is excellent and innovative.<br /><br />This is a 10 in my book , this movie will take you places the normal and expected Hollywood script will not . They took some risks and did a few things different . I think it worked well , I am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer , not accepting someone else 's interpretation .
1 This movie is about human relationships . Charming , funny , and well written , with meaningful text . It seems that Morgan Freeman surely have fun at the set . Also good music . Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman . I really enjoy her acting . Woman like her are a good motivation to learn Spanish language . From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the cute Paz Vega the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed . 10 Items or Less is about zest of life . If you enjoy this film see also The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son . That s not a action film or a nude comedy . Its all about human relations .
1 This movie is not great , but it is a good and enjoyable one . It feels like an indie film made out of a play script . Morgan Freeman basically plays himself , although the director swears the script was not written for him . And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he has n't committed to yet . I mean , he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it : ) < br /><br />I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste , but refreshing nonetheless . This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go . A bit too much emphasis on appearance , if you ask me.<br /><br />Bottom line : a nice little film , made in two weeks , with basically two actors and a few extras , dialogue driven , makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
1 Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style , a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window , behind which is playing out a sleazy card game - an opening flourish which , along with some of the location shooting , anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil . One of the players throws open the window ; it 's an appropriate action , serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld.<br /><br />Shot in high contrast black and white , Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans . Scenes set in such places as the mortuary , the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of ' Frank 's Place ' offer a unique , and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere , impossible to recreate in the studio . With these elements , Kazan 's film shows the influence of Dassin 's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier , which established the gritty , almost documentary style within the noir cycle . In fact , Widmark 's previous role had been in Dassin 's even finer Night And The City , a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent . Joe MacDonald , a favourite with the director , photographed Panic In The Streets ' detailed environment . MacDonald also worked on Kazan 's Pinky and Viva Zapata ! , and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller 's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street.<br /><br />As others have noticed , in a manner typical of some noir films , Kazan 's work offers a contrast between the confusion , sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest , calm home life of the Reeds . But whereas ( for instance ) in Lang 's The Big Heat ( 1953 ) the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character - ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance - Panic In The Streets places Reed 's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working ' day ' . Despite all the danger , ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied . The implication being that social balance has been restored , at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills.<br /><br />That imbalance of course , has been created by crime and disease . The two are closely associated in this film . It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra ( 1986 ) - where " Crime is the disease . Meet the cure , " a neat analogy in context , if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism . At its climax , as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship , the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals , both posing a menace to society 's health . As ( the presumably infected ) Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies , in search of something he suspects everyone is after , if without knowing exactly what it is , ' plague ' and ' Blackie ' resonate together in the audiences mind , adding further to connected associations . Ironically Blackie 's hunch about Poldi 's unfortunate cousin , that " he brought something in " of note is correct - even if , finally , its nothing he can sell or steal . Blackie 's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it , and his so confusion is understandable.<br /><br />Dr Reed , although home - loving , and on the side of society , is a true noir hero . Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone , forced to travel beyond the limits of the law . In his way , Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large - a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite , given director Kazan 's controversial personal history . The director testified before the infamous HUAC , naming suspected communists and fellow travellers . His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning , and the manhandling of the press , on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means . These actions perhaps echo the director 's sentiments at the time , presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry . In these times of terrorist threats and state response , such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern.<br /><br />Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin 's presumed contraband . Cat like , Blackie stalks his victim across the room , eventually preying over the doomed man 's sick bed , holding Poldi 's feverish head in his hands - a striking , evil cradling . It 's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption , whether moral or physical . Apparently , the actors did many or all of their own stunts , which leads to some other , very dramatic scenes at the end , as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs . Half crawling , half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance , but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all.<br /><br />Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer . Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup . Perhaps just as astonishingly , he never inoculates himself - inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises . At the end of the film , too , the potential epidemic has been halted , all contactees located , a little too neatly . But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today .
1 This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio - terrorism , and the threats of superbugs , West Nile Virus , and SARS . As a thriller , the tension is fairly intense . Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles . The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot . The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance . His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface . The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today . Recommended , 7/10 .
1 When a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague ( a variant of bubonic plague ) , U.S. Public Health Service official Dr. Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body . Unfortunately , the stiff got that way by being murdered , and there 's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague , leading to an epidemic . Enter Police Captain Tom Warren ( Paul Douglas ) , who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster.<br /><br />While Panic in the Streets is a quality film , it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling ( my reason for bringing the score down to an eight ) . It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster , police procedural , thriller and even romance.<br /><br />This is not director Elia Kazan 's best work , but saying that is a bit disingenuous . Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire ( 1951 ) , On The Waterfront ( 1954 ) and East of Eden ( 1955 ) , after all . This film predates those , but Kazan has said that he was already " untethered " by the studio . Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl . The film is set in New Orleans , a city where Kazan " used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well " . He wanted to exploit the environment . " It 's so terrific and colorful . I wanted boats , steam engines , warehouses , jazz joints -- all of New Orleans".<br /><br />Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well , but they could be connected better . The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods . The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked . Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt , " Quarantine " and " Some Like ' Em Cold".<br /><br />The gangster material , which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film , is probably the highlight . Not surprisingly , Kazan has said that he believes the villains are " more colorful -- I never had much affection for the good guys anyway . I do n't like puritans " . A close second is the only material that approaches the " panic " of the title -- the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed , inoculate them and contain the disease . While there is plenty of suspense during these two " moods " , much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama , with pacing more typical of that genre.<br /><br />The dialogue throughout is excellent . The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced . It is intelligent , delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character . Conflict is n't created by " dumb " decisions but smart moves ; events and characters ' actions are more like a chess game . When unusual stances are taken , such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers , he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions , which other characters argue over.<br /><br />In light of this , it 's interesting that Kazan believed that " propriety , religion , ethics and the middle class are all murdering us " . That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm , or allowances away from it , made by the protagonists . For example , head gangster Blackie ( Jack Palance in his first film role ) is offered a " Get Out of Jail Free " card if he 'll cooperate with combating the plague.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are fine , if nothing exceptional , but the real reasons to watch are the performances , the intriguing scenario and the well - written dialogue .
1 In New Orleans , an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie ( Walter Jack Palance ) . He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch ( Zero Mostel ) and Poldi ( Guy Thomajan ) , killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea . During the autopsy , the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty - eight hours to avoid an epidemic . The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren ( Paul Douglas ) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.<br /><br />"Panic in the Streets " discloses a simple story , but it is still effective and with a great villain . The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty - seven years . Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut , and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Pânico nas Ruas " ( " Panic in the Streets " )
1 " Panic in the Streets " is a fairly unknown little movie from director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as " A Streetcar Named Desire " , " On the Waterfront " and " East of Eden " . Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947 , before this movie , so he was not a completely unknown at the time . Still " Panic in the Streets " is mostly a movie that passed under the radar.<br /><br />The great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script . It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime / film - noir elements . The dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility.<br /><br />The cast is fairly unknown ( especially at the time it was released ) but it still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first movie roles . Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss , with a very powerful looking face.<br /><br />Still the movie drags a little at some points . The movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from.<br /><br />Yet , " Panic in the Streets " remains a perfectly watchable movie , mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch . For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.<br /><br />8/10
1 Refreshing ` lost ' gem ! Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them . The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes . Palance is his usual evil presence . Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene , a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a ` logical ' end , and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood . You know how it will likely end , but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout . The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see . The film seems to slow a little past the middle , but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion .
1 In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S. Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague . As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest . That 's not the issue here , the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease.<br /><br />As was pointed out by any number of people , for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they 're from Louisiana . Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that . Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there , but for those that are natives it does n't work.<br /><br />But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret , the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city 's underworld . The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections . A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms . Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice.<br /><br />Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel . This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies . He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film , The Enforcer . Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark , Douglas , and half the New Orleans Police . Seeing the weight challenged Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I 'm kind of in Zero 's league now in the heft department.<br /><br />Kazan kept the action going at a good clip , there 's very little down time in this film . If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film . Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year.<br /><br />Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French Quarter . Some of the same kinds of shots are later used in On the Waterfront . In fact Panic In The Streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest . Very similar again to On the Waterfront.<br /><br />Panic In The Streets does everyone proud who was associated with it . Now why could n't Elia Kazan get some decent New Orleans sounding people in the small roles .
1 When plague breaks out in New Orleans , it 's Richard Widmark to the rescue in " Panic in the Streets , " one of the lesser - celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan . Kazan keeps the pace brisk , and there are lots of marvelous touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes , who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens , which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low - lifes , portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance , his weak yes man , Zero Mostel , Tommy Cook , and Louis Charles . There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height.<br /><br />The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story is n't quite up to the direction and performances . It has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily . That aside , it 's well worth viewing . Kazan was a masterful director .
1 " Panic in the Streets " was a decent thriller , but I felt a bit disappointed by it . The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating , but the film never really explores or develops it . Its well made and entertaining , but its not as interesting as it should have been . The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down . None of the central characters are really compelling or believable.<br /><br />Fortunately , the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting . The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace . There are some standout sequences , particularly the memorable chase climax . When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later , the man could mostly do no wrong.<br /><br />The acting is also very good . Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character . Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well . The standouts in the cast are the two villains . Zero Mostel , known primarily for his comic roles , is effectively slimy as one of cinema 's ultimate toady characters . Jack Palance is , unsurprisingly , a chilling villain . " Panic in the Streets " is disappointing but still worth watching . ( 7/10 )
1 I ca n't really condemn the movie because it does work . There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie , but I think it 's only just in the category.<br /><br />There 's nothing sinister in this piece , and that 's where the noir elements fail . Sure , the disease might be considered sinister , but I have a hard time seeing that . The movie hints at a darker side : Blackie may be trafficking human beings , the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter , the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie ... but those are really only hints.<br /><br />There 's no attempt made to question Reed 's motivations , as one with do with Marlowe or Spade , nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to Blackie , which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out.<br /><br />That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end.<br /><br />The story is decent , the acting is good , the writing and direction are well done ... but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over . Worth watching once , maybe twice if you do n't remember it from years ago , and then putting away .
1 Given its time of release , the story that unravels in 1950 thriller ' Panic in the Streets ' was hardly a surprise . The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague . Yet with the current drama in the world today , this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today 's viewers . The cast and crew are flawless . Richard Widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in ' Night and the City , ' Jack Palance in his chilling film debut , also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young ( and rather cute ) Barbara Bel Geddes . A whole slew of uncredited , non - professional actors ( typical of director Kazan ) fill in the remaining slots . Elia Kazan directs , Joe MacDonald films ( he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953 's much superior ' Pickup on South Street ' ) and the great Alfred Newman scores it . Nearly everyone involved here has done better work , ' Panic in the Streets ' is quite the rewarding watch , nonetheless . Especially for the film - noir enthusiast .
1 Just a comment on New Orleans accents ... <br /><br />An earlier reviewer noted the following : " This film , could have been shot in New York , or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like " broklynese " than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country . " There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer.<br /><br />Many people in New Orleans do , in fact , sound " broklynese " . I have never found out why . ( It 's mentioned in " A Confederacy of Dunces " by John Kennedy Toole . ) I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail , as this one did . Too often it 's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent .
1 Elia Kazan , one of the best theater directors this country ever had , showed he was equally at home with movies . With " Panic in the Streets " , Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later , with perhaps his master piece , " On the Waterfront " , although both movies share only the water setting , for they are different visions about different subjects.<br /><br />Mr . Kazan shot on location in New Orleans . The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories that are the basis of the film , is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting " The Big Easy " . One of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best . Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch.<br /><br />This film , could have been shot in New York , or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like " broklynese " than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country.<br /><br />One thing comes clear in the movie , Jack Palance , making his screen debut , smolders the screen every time one sees him . He was so intense ! At the same time , this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner , who unknown to him , is stricken with a fatal disease . Blackie , comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man 's greasy hair with abandon . Notable also , was the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts , something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real.<br /><br />The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film . We see a family man painting furniture with his young son . Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they ca n't make ends meet with his salary , something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis . Richard Widmark , playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people . Barbara Bel Geddes , as the wife , sounds as though she 's a suburban woman from Connecticut.<br /><br />The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr. Kazan 's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie .
1 A neat ' race against time ' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague , so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts , the murderers think the heat is because the victim 's infected cousin is holding out on them . < br /><br />This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it 's well worth downloading . A lot ( all ? ) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations , which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail , though to me it does look under - exposed , even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then were n't what they are . There is also a plenty of location background noise , which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene , anyone ? There are a lot of non - professional supporting artists in crowd scenes , and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting , though the final chase is worth hanging on for . There 's not much wrong with the lead actors either : Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic , intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific , while Widmark , as he often did , pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time . < br /><br />Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals , no mysticism , no special FX , just a good yarn full of character conflict , and a topical theme . Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole , and that 's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark , sleazy , against - the - clock drama . There 's even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />"Community ? What community ? D'you think you 're living in the Middle Ages ? "
1 A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague.<br /><br />An effective , and classy , little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat . Set and filmed in and around New Orleans , Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine , Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story . It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director . In turn , Richard Widmark { bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire } , Paul Douglas , Jack Palance ( as Walter Jack Palance ) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel , all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic.<br /><br />Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan 's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece . From Widmark 's Public Health doctor , with hypodermic needle in hand , running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good ; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them ; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point . To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema . With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark 's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior.<br /><br />It 's an imaginative and intelligently written story , one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease . A blight on society as it were . It 's noirish elements , such as paranoia , blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being . While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created . Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway , this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end . Not essential film - noir , and maybe not even essential Kazan , but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day . 7.5/10
1 " Panic In The Streets " is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans , using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation . As a result , the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable . An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster , provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken , then increase the tension to a high level.<br /><br />Following a dispute between the participants in a card game , a man called Kochak ( Lewis Charles ) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area . When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus , U.S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague . Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action , anyone infected could be expected to die within days.<br /><br />As the identity of the dead man is unknown , the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed 's briefing . They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently . The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community , a group of seamen , the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man 's identity and his contacts are eventually found.<br /><br />Kochak , an illegal immigrant , had been in a gang with Blackie ( Jack Palance ) , Raymond Fitch ( Zero Mostel ) and Vince Poldi ( Tommy Cook ) and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation , he presumes that Kochak must 've smuggled something very valuable into the country . As Kochak and Poldi were related , Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more . Poldi , however , is very ill and unable to provide any information . Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows.<br /><br />Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man . In an unusual type of role for him , he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly . Jack Palance 's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak 's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation . His distinctive looks also help to make his on - screen presence even more compelling.<br /><br />In typical docu - noir style , expressionist cinematography and neo - realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place . Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside .
1 I wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on Walter Jack Palance ( Blackie ) . Certainly he looks like no one else of the time , that skull - like face , flattened nose , and elongated body-- even now he remains an unsettling presence . And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city . I 'm just sorry he did n't have more scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue 's black humor , the Widmark- Douglas interplay , the un - touristy locations , the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time . Even Widmark 's domestic scenes that put a woman ( Bel Geddes ) on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive . Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio ( Fox ) product , no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect.<br /><br />Widmark does a solid low - key job as the public health officer . But my money is on the one- and - only Zero Mostel . Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy ( e.g. The Enforcer , 1950 ) . That scene with Mostel , where Palance argues with Mostel 's shrewish wife ( Liswood ) , is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball . Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist . ( I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him.)<br /><br />But it 's not only the professionals that add color . The locals add both character and authenticity , especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops . That whole scene has an improvised air , as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot . Then too , that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration . And what about those flea - bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Denny's.<br /><br />Anyway , the movie is still a well - staged , riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of today 's mega - hits .
1 Like A Streetcar Named Desire ( also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen ) Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does n't even rate a mention . It was Richard Widmark 's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer . Gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance ( still being billed as Walter Jack Palance)as the local Mr ' Big ' followed side - kick Zero Mostel , Barbara Bel Geddes , Emile Meyer , Tommy Rettig plus the rock - solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who comes round to doc Widmark 's point of view . It 's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen . Catch it if you can .
1 No , not really , but this is a very good film indeed , and is sadly a forgotten gem . Black and white suits the film.<br /><br />Straight forward formula , a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die.<br /><br />Very well directed , and the acting is great . Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain , and Jack Palance ( never better than this ) and Zero Mostel as the baddies . Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies .
1 Kazan 's early film noir won an Oscar . Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism , and rate it very highly . I can almost see where they are coming from . But I prefer to take a more toned - down approach to a long - forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi - documentary fashion . Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans , and it is up to a military doctor ( Widmark ) and a city detective ( Douglas ) to apprehend the main carrier ( Palance ) . The film is moody , shot in stark black and white , and makes very good use of locations . Widmark is wonderful as usual . Forget the symbolism ( crime equals disease , and disease equals crime ) and just enjoy the chase . It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century , as it is of a particular style that was very short - lived ( post WWII through the early 1950s ) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher . For those who will be watching this for the first time , sit tight for the big chase at the end . It is something else , and frankly I do n't know how they filmed some of it . I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie .
1 As the film opens , two thugs kill another thug . When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied , the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead , he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plague -- a very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague ! So , it 's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately , otherwise a disaster could erupt.<br /><br />Oddly , I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague , as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes . The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie . The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really would n't have been allowed to show it . Sure , there is high fever and coughing ( they got this right ) but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood -- along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you 'd get with the Bubonic plague -- all purply and gross ! I can certainly understand why they did n't go this far . Also , I am sure that the federal government would have had a much , much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease -- here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill - prepared and a bit dumb . No one seemed willing to believe the doctors ! ! As for the acting , the film had some excellent actors here . Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are , respectively , the public health doctor and police chief . Good actors but also known actors back in 1950 . However , in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance ( still going by his original moniker , ' Walter Jack Palance ' ) as well as the relatively unknown ( at the time ) Zero Mostel . Palance was great -- very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts . Mostel played a heavy typical of his early work -- a greasy and cowardly sort of evil.<br /><br />Overall , despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly , the film is very tense and has excellent acting -- and is well worth seeing .
1 ' Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) ' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts . Like Reed 's ' The Third Man ( 1949 ) ' and Dassin 's ' Night and the City ( 1950 ) , ' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location , capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums . In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism , he also hired many non - professional actors for minor roles , lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape . However , any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided , for ' Panic in the Streets ' is pure melodrama , of the best kind . A murdered illegal immigrant , fished out of the bay , is found to be infected with pneumonic plague , a deadly air - borne mutation of bubonic plague , which is transmitted from human - to - human and , untreated , has a mortality rate that approaches 100 % . Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) , an officer with the U.S. Public Health Service , convinces the doubtful police - chief ( Paul Douglas ) to undertake a city - wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide , lest they also be infected with the illness.<br /><br />In my younger years , I found Wolfgang Petersen 's ' Outbreak ( 1995 ) ' to be among the most horrifying movies I 'd ever seen . That thriller , which owes plenty to ' Panic in the Streets ' { working title : " Outbreak " } , terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing ? Kazan 's film is the first ( that I know of ) to approach the subject of biological epidemics , though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye ; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague . Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society , you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk { some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague , though I think it 's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff}. Nevertheless , there 's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man 's killers , underground street - rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds.<br /><br />In medieval times , when the Black Death ( now widely believed to have been bubonic plague ) swept across the civilised world , killing a third of Europe 's population , many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil . Jack Palance 's character , Blackie , serves effectively as Satan in human form : the angular - jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic , but is always liable to explode into fits of violence ; his two hoodlums ( played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel ) , through terror more than anything else , are constantly grovelling at his feet . When one lackey falls ill with fever , Blackie deduces that the man 's immigrant cousin must have " brought something in with him " ( the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed ) , and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be . He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms , a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling . Blackie / Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities , but by the burden of his own infection / evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship , the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe .
1 Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan . Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes . < br /><br />A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game . It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact . City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease . A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles . < br /><br />Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community . Regardless of outcome , you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film 's protagonist . < br /><br />Richard Widmark as Dr . Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers . Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed 's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of ( restful more than comic ) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald . Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic . Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie ( Black Death ? ) is simply outstanding . With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well . In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity , especially in the film 's powerful final allegorical moments . < br /><br />Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan 's best non - Brando film . It 's tension filled , suspensefully well paced and edited . It 's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb .
1 And a rather Unexpected plot line too - for the era : there is Plague in the City of New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it ! Elia Kazan 's trademark subjects : waterfronts , working men , crowds , fugitives , blue collar folk , violence on a backstreet - are all showcased here.<br /><br />Jack Palance is quite effective as the ice - cold mobster out for a big score , Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go - fer . I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the stalwart , cool wife - I thought she and Widmark were a believable couple.<br /><br />He himself always reminds me somewhat of Sinatra - in the face and in the intense quiet manner - and that is meant as a compliment if anything . I 'd never even heard of this movie , and yes , you have to admire Widmark 's performance . I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times , they make an unlikely but effective team.<br /><br />The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you got ta know it 's not exactly done the way it would have been in Real Life - rather small - scale at the least no ?- but I found it carried the plot along nicely.<br /><br />Check this out . It 's good . * * * outta * * * *
1 A small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store , and picking stuff just because I have n't seen it . A large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen.<br /><br />Long before Elia Kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies ( not good ones ) , he made this better than average drama . Watching it you begin to notice how many decent , good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated . Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large ... preferably large , and unsubtle , and scandalous . Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director . ( um . No thanks ) < br /><br />His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot . The plague is coming ! But here 's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope ; here 's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes , with her bathos turned way down ( well , for her ) ; they 're a couple and they share some nicely - written scenes about big crises and smaller ones . Here 's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships - crew ; here 's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment . These are the small - scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life ; something Hollywood , in its greed , now studiously avoids . These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them . It 's a personable , human - scaled film , not the grotesque , overscaled production that he and others ( David Lean ) will later popularize , whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />I just watched it twice and I 'll be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is seeking in the final scenes , but it does n't seem that important to me as a viewer . This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain , and Naked City , which you should really get your hands on .
1 The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat , which might lead to some unrealized expectations . Frankly speaking , there 's very little " panic in the streets " to be seen here . In fact , throughout the movie very few people actually know that there 's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters . Having said that , what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway ( because , unlike the people " in the streets " , the viewer knows what 's going on ) and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately . As the plague - infected killer is sought , one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed ( Richard Widmark ) and Police Captain Warren ( Paul Douglas ) . At the beginning , the two really do n't like each other , even though they have to work together . By the end , they 've forged a real bond of respect for each other . Kazan did a good job with that.<br /><br />Pretty much all the performances here were excellent . Widmark and Douglas were great , and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical " heavy " role . I found very little to criticize here . Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across as a little bit flat as Reed 's wife Nancy , but her role was n't really central to the story . All in all , an excellent piece of work . 9/10
1 One of America 's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan . His directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers , since Kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle . However , ' Panic in the Streets ' is a first - rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released . The themes of illegal immigrants , people - smuggling , imminent plagues , rapid transmission around the world of diseases ( a worried Richard Widmark says : ' I could be in any American city in ten hours and in Africa tomorrow . ' ) , ethnic isolation and ghettoism are today 's concerns more than ever . This film features a spectacular film debut by Jack Palance , and a wonderful performance by Barbara Bel Geddes , two casting strokes of genius . Richard Widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once , and is a deeply caring , warmly loving , intense hero of the people . He leads basically a one - man campaign to stop an epidemic of pneumonic plague in New Orleans , struggling to convince sluggish politicians and complacent policemen that there is a problem . There is a race against time to find the small - time crooks who have contracted the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours , before the whole city , and as they are always reminding us , the whole country , are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu . One amazing scene where Jack Palance , who is infected , is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat - barrier on the rope is ironic in the extreme , reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst carriers and vermin of all . The highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call ' the coffee factory ' at the wharfs rivals the most inventive climax scenes of Hitchcock , and with just as spectacular a setting . Many non - professionals appear in the film , which has the gritty realism of , well , something called reality . Kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went , and where even rats would have thought twice . This film was a major feat of social realism . If it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers , it is because Kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up , for after all , the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and molls . The only unfortunate thing about the film is the title , which gives a false suggestion of superficiality . But Kazan was anything but superficial . He clearly considered this project a public duty , to alert us to genuine possibilities . If only those possibilities had diminished today , but alas , they are getting worse every day . One day , after a worldwide plague , this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an outbreak was contained on film , but its lessons were forgotten .
1 This film has , over the past ten years , become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences . The three storyline threads given us by Kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures . The domestic chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark , the movement between rooms , the small gestures such as the phone book Barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table , those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife , all are well crafted and natural . More than anything else , I love their porch , that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time . The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between Widmark and Douglas ' characters . It may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all , it comes across as real , respectful and efficient . The third thread , the grungy tale of Blackie and his tattered little gang , gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world . Palance 's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice . This self - proclaimed business man , this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to . For me , this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience .
1 This very good movie crackles with tension . The stakes are , of course , high -- will the police and Widmark , the public health doctor , apprehend the criminals who do n't know that they are carrying plague before a full - scale epidemic breaks out ? But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene -- between Widmark and the police captain , between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel , between Palance and a dying plague - stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity , between Widmark and his wife , and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full - scale panic . The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan , in extraordinarily well - choreographed long takes shot on location in New Orleans , and ends in a stunning climax , where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers , through the docks and warehouses of the city . The commentary is superb , probably the best that I 've heard , covering the cinematography , the framing and lighting of shots , the production design , the casting of non - professional actors in small roles , and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot , like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally . Watch it once to enjoy the film on its own , and , if you are interested in film - making , a second time with the commentary on to learn .
1 Most movies about , or set in , New Orleans , turn out to be laughably bad , and laughably inaccurate ( examble : remember " The Savage Bees " ? But I 'll make an exception for " Tightrope " , which almost got it right).<br /><br />Here 's one that does n't inevitably get it wrong . The accents are not too bad ( yes , the " yat " accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern ) , the city of 1950 is shown the way it is / was , without the obligatory " tourist " shots , and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a " quirky southerner " . < br /><br />One of the few films to do justice to this city , and a good film to boot ..
1 I first saw Martin 's Day when I was just 10 years old , at home , on The Movie Channel , and still remember the impact it made on my life . It touched me as no other film had touched me , and I remember balling my eyes out.<br /><br />After the first time I saw it , I could n't find it anywhere else . I would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film ! I guess it was one of those more rare films that not many people knew about , because no one , and I mean no one , knew what I was talking about . I searched and searched throughout the years , checking video stores shelves and scanning cable TV listings , but always came up short . Finally , in 1996 I found out I could special order it , I did , and have probably watched it at least 50 times since -- and it still makes me cry , every time.<br /><br />Martin 's Day is about Martin Steckert , a man who is in prison ( but genuinely a good guy ) , who yearns to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as boy . This was a special place , where he lived off nature , spent time with his dog , and was left alone to enjoy life . Soon into the movie , he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake.<br /><br />It is n't long before the cops find him , and Steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off . Soon Steckert and his hostage ( the 2nd Martin ) become best friends , and have many fun adventures together -- from robbing a toy truck , to hi - jacking a train , all on the way to this special lake.<br /><br />Throughout the movie , Steckert has great flashbacks of him at the lake as a boy.<br /><br />I wo n't ruin the ending for you , but I will tell you , this movie is a must see . It is the BEST movie I have EVER seen in my life ! I am , without a doubt , the biggest fan of this movie EVER ! I managed to find the song that the two Martin 's are singing throughout the movie ( " I 'm going back , to where I come from ... ) . I 'm even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and cottage where Martin 's Day was filmed . Crazy , I know -- but that movie just means so much to me .
1 A well - made and imaginative production , refreshingly free from cliché , this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions : the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage . Expertly directed by Alan Gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement , the film provides freshness in nearly every scene , as felon Martin Steckert ( Richard Harris ) , believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved , contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan , following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood . Often bursting into song or dancing a few steps , the capricious Steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and , as police close in for an inevitable showdown , the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection , as discerned by a psychiatrist ( Lindsay Wagner ) assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant ( James Coburn ) who is in charge of the manhunt for Steckert and his " prisoner " . This is an engrossing story , worth telling , a quickly - paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by Harris , fine turns from Wagner , Coburn , and Karen Black , along with Justin Henry as the snatched lad , with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by Wilfred Josephs , and top - notch cinematography by Frank Watts , with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal Ontario province .
1 I do n't believe this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris . This was an uncomplicated plot , yet interesting . It is a good movie to watch when you do n't want to do a lot of thinking , just want to be told a simple story . The Canadian scenery was breathtaking . The beautiful Fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing .
1 " An album of songs so old everyone thinks they 're new . " This film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments . And why not ? Towering talent from Dame Judith Dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right , to Olympia Dukakis as the merry widow living in a Scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages , to Ian Holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a World War II all girl ( more or less ) swing band . But wait , there 's more . Add in Leslie Caron on bass , and the incomparable Clio Laine on lead vocal , at last , and the Blonde Bombshells are the hottest band in England since the Beatles . Well , OK , not really , but this movie is a winner.<br /><br />Elizabeth ( Dench ) spends the whole film trying to reunite the Blonde Bombshells to play at her granddaughter 's school dance . And before you roll your eyes , imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of sexegenarian women to step onstage in front of the Britney Spears generation following an act called " Open Wound." < br /><br />In an age when actresses careers are over by the time they 're 30 , most bands ' second album is a greatest hits compilation , and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay , it 's great to see real talent , real music and a really good movie come from , where else , the BBC.<br /><br />I love this movie , and I know I 'll watch it many more times , and enjoy it more each time .
1 Charming in every way , this film is perfect if you 're in the mood to feel good . If you love jazz music , it is a must see . If you enjoy seeing loveable characters that make you smile , can bring a tear to your eye and swing like there 's no tomorrow this film is for you . If you are looking for an intense , deep , heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed perhaps you best stick with something by Darren Aronofsky ( in other words - reviewer djjohn lighten up , do n't you know a good time when you see one ! ) My only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short . I guess I 'll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill .
1 Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra , who performed throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera house , this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the ( almost ) all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of WWII . All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music , and help to fill in the background to the band members , and in particular to the girls ' relationships with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer ( who is trying to dodge the call - up).<br /><br />Ian Holm ( " Lord of The Rings " , " Cromwell and Fairfax " ) and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth , and the conniving , womanizing Patrick , the drummer . The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band 's leader , now playing bar piano at the sea - side , and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player . Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine , Leslie Caron , Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience . The movie is a romp down memory lane , with an all star cast of what ought , by all rights , to be a bunch of over - the - hill actresses . All I can say is , I hope I look as good at their age ! Leslie Caron , in particular , is still an incredible fox , at 69 years of age . She certainly still gets my pulse going ! As I watched it , I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age . Afterwards , I looked these girls up , and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the London of 1944 ( although this might be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench).<br /><br />If you like swing bands , thrive on nostalgia , or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her , do n't miss this film.<br /><br / >
1 Much to her adult children 's chagrin & nearly immediately after Elizabeth 's ( Dame Judy Dench ) husband 's death , the widowed , attic tenor saxophone player becomes bent upon openly returning to her musical hobby . Now that George is dead , Elizabeth no longer has to practice playing sax in the attic . As she grows more pleased with playing in the open , Elizabeth takes a stroll along memory lane , remembering when she was a 15 year old member of a jazz swing band , " The Blonde Bombshells " : supposedly , an all - girl WWII group of talented jazz swing musicians . One of the " Blonde Bombshells ' " band members was a womanizing , cross - dressing drummer , Patrick ( Ian Holm ) , with whom Elizabeth remained friends.<br /><br />Both Patrick & Elizabeth 's 12-year - old grand - daughter , Joanna ( Millie Findlay ) , press Elizabeth to round up the former band members & take up performing together again ; this time as a bunch of sexagenarians . Among the band members she finds are the ( still foxy ! ) bass playing , Madeleine ( Leslie Caron ) ; Dinah ( Olympia Dukakis ) , a trumpet playing , alcoholic & out - spoken , money - grubbing divorcée & widow living off of wealth from her many ( ex)marriages in a Craigievar Scottish castle ; Gwen , ( real life US star jazz singer , Clio Laine ) , having at the lead vocal ; Annie , ( June Whitfield ) , as the Salvation Army trombone player ; Betty , ( the late piano player , Joan Sims ) , who 's located training the ivory keys in a Hastings pub.<br /><br />As Elizabeth , Patrick & Joanna scout the world for members of the 1940 's band & try to convince them to resume performing together , Elizabeth is oft times beside herself as she learns more than she wants to know about their adult lives -- including her own -- while having a blast playing terrific music with the last of the living ' Blonde Bombshells'.<br /><br />Amusing , nostalgic , historical , sentimental , multi - generational entertainment that is seriously fun . The actors deliver wonderful performances . Regardless of their ages , they are still Bombshell entertainers who put on quite a show . ( The DVD is now out & worth owning because of the bonus features & Dolby Digital sound ) . Surely as a fan of any of these terrific actors the VHS is a collector 's item .
1 No message . No symbolism . No dark undercurrents . Just a wonderful melange of music , nostalgia and good fun put to - gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it . It 's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios . Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching . And Cleo Laine 's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus . This lady is in the same league as the late Ella . This goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle . Just a wonderful film !
1 This is a quirky movie that the Brits do so well . Low budget , cameo type roles , well executed . The story is a little weak , a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to round up the " blonde bombshells ' a all ( well almost all ) girl band who performed during the war in London . The obligatory son / daughter who thinks she 's gone potty . I did like the way the movie lets young people see that they do n't have a monopoly on feelings , love and even lust ! That the " old wrinklies " can have a good laugh too . Judi Dench was superb as always , a pity we did n't get to see more of the other " blonde bombeshells , the end was a little rushed I thought . I kept thinking as I watched that David Jason would have made an even better Patrick than Ian Holm , although he was quite adequate as the " transvestite " drummer . All in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls :)
1 I 'm so glad I happened to see this video at the store . I was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem . I loved that the movie , a love story of sorts , was n't about some beautiful twenty - somethings ; rather , it 's a story of some beautiful sixty - somethings , who used used to be twenty - somethings . It 's a good , well written , and wonderfully acted story with fabulous WWII band music thrown in as well . It 's also got a delightful surprise in it for Scottish castle lovers . It left me smiling and ready to watch it again , which I did a couple more times before I turned it in . I highly recommend it .
1 A charming little film set in the UK about the reunion of a WWII all girl ( almost ) swing band . A fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by Dench and Laine 's always great " pipes " . Time well spent and a fun watch for all .
1 This film pulls you in from the get - go because it grabs our attention by acknowledging , yeah , that this story is opening with a cliché  a funeral.<br /><br />In hands other than Judi 's I would n't have given it an 8 as this material has been done over and over again : The great reunion of a once famous , pick one please , team , army platoon , theatre group , singers , band.<br /><br />But this movie never stoops to cheap sentimentalization , and when you think it is going to it swoops off in another direction . A case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi.<br /><br />The band members are an interesting group and ride above the clichés too . One is in jail , one has found religion , one is an alkie , and one has sunk into dementia . But the joie de vivre rediscovered by Judi , ignited by her granddaughter 's interest , carries us along and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot.<br /><br />The cast are a who 's who of talent , Leslie Caron , the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes , a last performance from Joan Sims , brava Joan , a cute as a button flirtatious Ian Holm having a ball , and Olympia Dukakis as a money - grabbing divorcée living in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey , The closing scene is standard Hollywoodland fare , the judgmental children of the star converted to fun - loving supporters , the old lovers reunited , the youngsters swept up in the old timers ' music . Life should be this simple . But I would watch it again , and intend to , with my own granddaughter . For in the right hands , sometimes one just loves these brazen old clichés . 8 out of 10 .
1 " I hate those stories that begin with a funeral , but I 'm afraid this one begins the day we buried George . Not that we buried him . In the interests of the environment we had him incinerated . " So speaks Elizabeth ( Judi Dench ) , George 's widow . She 's led a comfortable , predictable life with George . She has two grown children and a 12-year - old grandchild . But when she was 15 and in school , in the midst of World War II , she played the sax at night in an all - girl ( almost all - girl ) band called The Blonde Bombshells . The ' almost " was because the drummer was Patrick , a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed . With a yellow wig , a long red dress and makeup , Patrick looked almost as good as the others . < br /><br />One afternoon after the funeral , Elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the sax she had put away . She used to practice , but only when George was out of the house on the golf course . Then two things happen . Her granddaughter , amazed at how good Elizabeth is , starts talking about how the Blonde Bombshells could be reunited and play at her school dance . Then Elizabeth encounters Patrick ( Ian Holm ) , now just as much an aging oldster as Elizabeth , and just as much attracted to her as he was more than 50 years ago . ( He also was attracted to all the other members of the Bombshells . The roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection . ) Well , why not see if the other band members can be located , and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter 's school ? < br /><br />Why not ? One member of the band is gaga . One is dead . One is in jail . One has found salvation with the Salvation Army . One they can find no trace of . One is last known to be in the States . One is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig , even for a reunion . But one by one Elizabeth and Patrick bring together the surviving members of the Bombshells . We do n't know if enough of them can be found . The rehearsals more often than not turn into off - key shambles . While they do this , we share Elizabeth 's flashbacks of what life was like when she and Patrick were young in war - time London , playing in the band while the bombs were falling . As terrible as it was , it was the most exciting time of their lives . When the night of Elizabeth 's granddaughter 's dance arrives , of course , the Blonde Bombshells , filled with jitters and renewed friendship , blow the youngsters away . Afterwards , Elizabeth informs us that the Bombshells are continuing to play at gigs , and that she and Patrick have no plans to get married ... but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around . < br /><br />This is sentimental hogwash , expertly done , and not bad at all . What makes it work are the skill and charm of Judi Dench and Ian Holm . When I hear the term , " warm - hearted comedy , " I usually cringe unless the actors are first - rate . Dench and Holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light - weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us . Then there 's the " old broad " gambit that 's fun if you remember the old broads . Among the Blonde Bombshells are Leslie Caron , Joan Sims , Olympia Dukakis , Billie Whitelaw and Cleo Laine . Laine sings three numbers and almost over - balances the production . She is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she 's singing the program nearly becomes the Cleo Laine Show . Another attractive feature is the number of great WWII songs played in strong swing .
1 It 's rare that I sit down in front of the TV specifically to watch a particular programme . It 's even rarer when I actually enjoy the programme in the end , but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I 've seen.<br /><br />A remarkable cast , led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm , and an excellent , witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience . I ca n't really express how good I thought it was , so I wo n't try , I 'll just say , if you get the opportunity , PLEASE SEE IT ! ! ! ! I only hope it comes out on video .
1 I grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular . What a wonderful time for music and dancing ! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and nightclubs . Guess it sounds like I 'm living in the past , ( I do have wonderful memories)so what 's wrong with that ? ! ! ? World War 2 was a terrible time , except where music was concerned . Glenn Miller 's death was a terrible sadness to us . This movie will be a favorite of mine . Clio Laine was excellent ; what a voice ! I do n't know how I ever missed this movie . My main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to Rap and New Age music , which is offensive to me . Please watch this movie and give it a chance !
1 This film was in one word amazing ! I have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere . A beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy . Judy Denchs ability to carry the whole film was amazing . Her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great
1 This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many , many times . The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters . There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format . As for Judi Dench , she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars . I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances . She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life . I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting . The movie public needs heroes , not deviant manikins , who lack ingenuity and talent . How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron , Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine . I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves . Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment . I congratulate the writer , director , producer , and all those who did such a fine job .
1 A great concept , a great cast , and what a pity there was n't more time to flesh out the story . I loved it and wanted more . Dench , Dukakis , and Laine , now there are some REAL women ! Still , Dench and her character alone had enough substance to carry the script over some of its lesser moments . I have it on tape and will continue to watch it , hoping that there is a clue at the end that suggests there will be a sequel.<br /><br />Top drawer ! - No Question ! - No Argument!<br /><br / >
1 Superb cast , more please!<br /><br />If you can catch just about anything else written by Plater ( or starring these wonderful actors ) . For anyone who does n't know Plater has a real feeling for jazz , my recommendation is to see the ' Beiderbecke ' trilogy whenever you can.<br /><br />"There 's three kinds of jazz - Hot , Cool and ' What time does the tune start ? ' "
1 This movie was on British TV last night , and is wonderful ! Strong women , great music ( most of the time ) and just makes you think . We do have stereotypes of what older people " ought " to do , and there are fantastic cameos of the " sensible but worried children " . Getting near to my best movie ever !
1 This has just been broadcast on BBC and I am absolutely delighted to have seen it . As the credits rolled , the cast alone made certain that I would give it a go . After just five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful film.<br /><br />Yes it was formulaic and predictable , but that somehow added to it 's charm . The flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions.<br /><br />A real feel - good film , punctuated throughout with outstanding music . When it 's released , I 'll buy it !
1 How can you resist watching a film with some swing ? It 's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line . Too bad they do n't tour out here ... I'd go see them . See it if for no other reason than to hear some good music .
1 The Last of the Blond Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff . Judy Dench plays Elizabeth , a newly widowed woman at loose ends . She has spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother but has never been truly happy.<br /><br />Shortly after her husband 's funeral , Elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick - in - the - mud children when she spots a street performer . This sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in London during World War II . We soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala Some Like It Hot.<br /><br />Elizabeth pulls out her sax ( which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage ) and joins forces with the guitar - playing street musician . Elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist , and the money begins to flow in . She does n't take any money as she is wealthy and does n't need it . Her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment.<br /><br />Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick ( Ian Holm ) who was the drummer - in - drag of the band . It seems that Patrick was - and still is - quite the ladies ' man , and Elizabeth - being only fifteen at the time - was the only band member who did not experience Patrick 's " talents " other than drumming.<br /><br />Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together once again to play for the granddaughter 's school dance . Thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all topped off with some really good swing and blues.<br /><br />I guess I 'm at the age in which I really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff , and this film is a treasure trove as it not only stars Judi Dench , but she is supported by none less than Olympia Dukakis , Leslie Caron , and a host of seasoned British character actresses . This is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine.<br /><br />Yes , it is fluff , but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff .
1 Possible spoilers re : late - appearing cameos < br /><br />Seldom does one see so many fine & memorable character actors ( almost entirely actresses to be precise ) in one film . Even though a few only appear for cameos , each one is a gem . The British do this mix of comedy and real - life pathos better than anyone IMO , so it is no surprise that most of the actors are Brits.<br /><br />The music is great ; no doubt much had to be dubbed ( does Leslie Caron * really * play the bass so well ? maybe - who knew ? ) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers.<br /><br />As an aging musician myself , not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course , it was a heartening film as well -- a great film for anyone whose wondering if they 're past it in their profession or avocation whatever it may be . And of course a great celebration of the life of the stage.<br /><br />I missed a little of the opening , but a provisional 9/10 -- and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing .
1 For persons of a certain age , W.W. II was the defining time of their lives , and whatever followed could never compare . As the movie opens , a recently widowed but still lively woman ( Judi Dench ) hears a street musician gamely attempting to play the classic song , " Stardust." < br /><br />This recalls her memories of when she played in an almost all - girl band that entertained between bomb raids during the War . The drummer , Patrick ( Ian Holm ) , happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies.<br /><br />Patrick and Dench 's character meet and decide to reunite the band , which takes them on a series of mini - adventures . Despite ups and downs , the band does reunite and makes a successful reappearance.<br /><br />The movie is exquisitely written and understated , with superb performances from all involved . The characters are well - developed and all people who have not quit living , despite their years . And there 's all that glorious old swing music!<br /><br />This is n't the pontification of Steven Spielberg , but a serious movie nevertheless . The War affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is n't afraid to entertain as it teaches .
1 We , as a family , were so delighted with ' The Last of the Blonde Bombshells ' we purchased a copy for our home video library.<br /><br />The acting is A1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers . The theme is unusual and the script well written . The music / songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices . To outline the story here would spoil the ' plot ' as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds.<br /><br />Full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly - laugh and lots of music .
1 It 's a funny business , reviewing movies . These days when " internalized emotions " and " emotional detachment " are favored over straightforward sentimentality , it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings.<br /><br />Soon after completing jury duties at the 58th Berlinale , I managed to catch Yoji Yamada 's Kabei.<br /><br />After the screening , I watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall , watery - eyed , men , women , and reviewers alike . Even the director of the Berlinale , obviously a hardened viewer of cinema , confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarter 's way into this unashamedly sentimental experience.<br /><br />But what really surprised me were the reviews that came after . Despite being ineffably moved by the film , many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non - committal in their writing . Apparently , post weeping , they had put on their " thinking cap " , and consequently , missed out on what I felt was the genius about Kabei.<br /><br />Allow me to explain.<br /><br />Set in pre - war Japan , the story of Kabei revolves around one writer 's family , and their fate therein , after he is held in jail for what was described as " thought crimes " against the Imperial will . Through a series of protracted emotional scenes , Yamada gets us familiar with the man , his loyal wife and two daughters , as well as three side charactersthe man 's pretty young sister , a bumbling ex - student , and a cad of an uncle  all come to help the family cope with their plight , in the absence of the man of the house.<br /><br />The story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace , and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict . This of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event.<br /><br />In other words , although you learn to love the family and their helpers , and sympathize with their unfortunate situation , you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending.<br /><br />However , two hours into the film ( do n't worry , Yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along ) , he slaps you with what I can only describe as " the sting " . All that you have assumed to be what the story was aboutan innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters  now suddenly points to one of the family helpers . Someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate.<br /><br />At this point , something curious happened in the theatre I was in . Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition.<br /><br />"My word ! " I muttered under my breath . It struck me then that " Kabei " , in the final analysis , was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war . It was , in fact , a cunning examination of one common human foible : How little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us.<br /><br />Now , the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid , but lacked innovation . That 's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap , I guess . With Kabei , I believe Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity . A wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the Tora - san series , and later , in Tasogare Sebei.<br /><br />After lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone , he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema.<br /><br />This , to me , is the most effective cinematic tool of all . One which avoids detection , but affects you deeply . And proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex , thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousand - seater cinema hall.<br /><br />Now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about . Human emotions . Pure and simple .
1 " Kaabee " depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during WWII , raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for " thought crime " . This movie was directed by Yamada Youji , and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful . Although the historical correctness of some scenes , most notably the beach scene , is a suspect.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible . I am baffled at how they managed to gather this all - star cast for a 2008 film . Yoshinaga Sayuri , possibly the most decorated still - active actress in Japan , will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film . Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well . It was Asano Tadanobu though , who delivered the most impressive performance , perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in.<br /><br />Films with pre - war setting is not my thing , but thanks to wonderful directing and acting , I was totally absorbed by the story . Also , it was n't a far - left nonsense like " Yuunagi no Machi , Sakura no Kuni " , and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan . Excellent film , highly recommended for all viewers .
1 My introduction into Yoji Yamada 's cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai , The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor . I had enjoyed all three films , and looking at the prolific , veteran director 's filmography , I think it 'll take me a very long while to watch all his films , especially the Tora - san series . Needless to say when Kabei Our Mother has finally reached our shores , I jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to Mothers everywhere , celebrating their innate love for their children.<br /><br />Based on the autobiography of Teruyo Nogami , Kabei - Our Mother tells of a close knit family of four  Mother Kayo " Kabei " ( Sayuri Yoshinaga ) , Father Shigeru " Tobei " ( Mitsugoro Bando ) , eldest daughter Hatsu ( Mirai Shida ) and youngest child Teru ( Miku Sato ) . From the get go their lives would be changed forever , when Shigeru gets arrested under the Peace Preservation Law for his morally controversial writings against the nation , set in the late 30s where Japan had begun their " crusade " in China , and thereafter their participation in WWII.<br /><br />So begins Kabei 's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family , and the frequent , difficult meetings with her husband behind bars . Help comes from relatives , especially on Shigeru 's side , since Kabei 's own dad had adopted an " I told you so " attitude with her choice of spouse . Shigeru 's one time student Yama ( arthouse buffs should recognize Tadanobu Asano here ) provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children , and Kabei 's sister in law Hisako ( Rei Dan ) from Hiroshima , which I believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline.<br /><br />While the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom , and in a distant relationship with their dad , what I enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in Japan . It 's against the historical backdrop of Japan 's push to regional dominance , and there are characters here that do n't mask those ambitions , even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands . This is something I rarely see in Japanese films , being that frank in their discussion of that era , and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort.<br /><br />The actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles , be they the veterans or the child actors . Actress Sayuri Yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances , while Mirai Shida and Miku Sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise . Each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough , or fill your heart with Joy should they be celebrating . Before long you 'll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family , thanks to the primary cast 's powerful performances , with Yoji Yamada coaxing some really natural performances from the kids.<br /><br />Kabei - Our Mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction , and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top , or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotions it seeks from the audience . There are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect , with every scene not being wasted , and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across , be it compassion or love.<br /><br />Aside from the very abrupt ending ( I had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more , despite its more than 2 hours runtime ) , Kabei Our Mother comes highly recommended , and you 'll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears , or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis . Just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder , then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you 'd probably have taken for granted .
1 A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist , warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre - war Japan , is accused of being a ' communist ' and jailed for life . His loving wife , who supports totally her husband and his ideas , is left alone to save her family from starvation . This movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind . Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she did n't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009 . It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential.<br /><br />This deeply moving and most ' human ' feature is a must see for all ' true children ' on earth .
1 Kabei : Our Mother ( 2008 ) is a poetic and sublime beauty from Japan . A real weeper ! I had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from Netflix . Am I glad I did ! In many ways this film reminded me of the old style of Japanese classic film - making from the 1940 's and 1950 's that I 've come to love so much , such as seen in Yasujiro Ozu pictures -- the title credits even begin in the same way , with the Japanese letters ( characters ) in red against neutral color burlap material . I immediately thought : this director loves Ozu . The same style was used too : mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes . Even a couple of " pillow shots " , as Roger Ebert calls them . The strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of a Japanese family before , and during , and after , World War Two . The mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father ( a University professor ) is arrested for anti - war sympathies . He 's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease . Meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls . He begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls . But war starts and he 's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell . Will they ever express their love for one another ? Will he ever return from the war ? < br /><br />There is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress , Sayuri Yoshinaga . She 's almost a Madonna type , she 's so beautiful ! Big soulful eyes and flawless skin . The actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well : his name is Tadanobu Asano . What a sensitive performance . There is no macho in him at all ; he 's gentle and kind . I 'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies . I think I 'll check to see what 's available for them . The two little child actresses are wonderful too.<br /><br />The film is just released on NTSC DVD for American audiences , with very easy to read English subtitles . I gave it a 10 out of 10 on the IMDb . I cried almost as much as with the Japanese film classic Twenty - Four Eyes ( 1954 ) . Do n't miss this film !
1 Actually one particular person / character is n't " right there " , but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie . And this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and/or big production sets , but with a great story and very ( believable ) and good actors conveying the story ( arc).<br /><br />You could call it a companion piece to great japan movies / cinema ( such as Tokyo Story etc . ) , not so much story - wise of course , but more mood - wise ! Great acting , nuances in the performances that are truly gems . If you 're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally , than this is the one to go . As you have noticed ( as with many of my reviews ) , I 'm not getting into the story . There are places here at IMDb where you can look those up , I 'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever !
1 I do n't know why some guys from US , Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do n't understand at all . For those who did not watch this movie - watch it . Do n't expect too much or do n't put some frameworks just because this is Kosturica . Watch the movie without prejudice , try to understand the whole humor inside - people of Serbia DID actually getting married while Bil Clinton bomb their villages , gypsies in all Balkans are ALWAYS try to f*ck you up in any way they can , LOVE is always unexpected , pure and colorful , and Balkans are extremely creative . For those who claims this is a bad movie I can see only that the American 's sh*t ( like Meet Dave , Get Smart etc ) are much much worse than a pure , frank Balkan humoristic love story movie as Promise me . The comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer . I think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside . It is simple , but true . It is brutal , but gentle and makes you laugh to dead .
1 " Father is still away on business " was headline of an review after " Promise Me This " premiere in Cannes . I do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of Kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics ca n't touch him . I had two hours of pure energy without rest . Even when Kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and unspoiled . Surprisingly good performance of Stribor Kusturica . Much More close - ups and less landscapes then in " Life Is A Miracle " . Marija Petronijevic has femme fatal world class potential , please do n't spoil it . Surely , I recommend to everyone to see this film .
1 Kusturika made it again . Another masterpiece . A coral comedy full of his own landmarks , with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments , we laughed and laughed , what a party ! The music is everywhere , and also the shooting , the animals , the crazy bastards , sex and amazing gadgets and inventions , everything colorfully visual to entertain only . Pure cinema in essence . A wonderful experience to watch . And one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare , and so wonderful . Well , this is one , and if you enjoyed Kusturica 's previous films , you 'll love this , although , as in all comedies , it is about a chemical reaction , and you have to be in the mood for it .
1 For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films -- the Western assault on traditional Serbian values -- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives . This continuous theme , expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle , is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate . Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus ' Underground ' , Kusturica 's films ' ' Black Cat White Cat ' , ' Life is a Miracle ' , and recently with ' Promise Me This ' , his slapstick , carnivalistic style underscores the ' westernization ' of Balkan culture , its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom . In the case of ' Promise Me This ' , the paradoxical world of city ( urban space ) and village ( traditional idiom ) space are contrasted . The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ; organized crime , sexual exploitation , a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values -- as expressed toward the young kid -- villager . The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one - way dirt road . They are on a collision coarse ; appropriately , the wedding , which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village , i.e. traditional values , are about to collide with the funeral mourners , exemplifying the death of tradition within this context . Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique , stylistic singularity . With his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .
1 Before ' Zavet ' there was similarity between Tim Burton and Kusturica artistic vision . They find their own , poetic style , and then they cowardly become prisoners of it . Burton has ( and still have ) Depp , Kusturica has Miki Manojlovic , and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again . However , there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time . That 's main reason why Kusturica 's worst movies are ' Black cat white cat ' and ' Life is miracle ' . ' Zavet ' is something completely different . You may like it , you may hate it , but this is NOT just another Kusturica poetic  Balkanic dreamlike stuff . Of course , if you want to be praised , you have to play safe . It was very easy for Kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award . Fortunately , as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works . ' Zavet ' can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous Kusturica movies directed by Kusturica himself . It is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously . This is quality that Kusturica have and even the biggest , like Bergman or Kubrick , did n't have . This movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd , so absurd that becomes deep , and so unfunny that becomes hilarious . Same stuff that make ' Plan 9 from outer space ' cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it . Average western viewer would not get few references . Most notable , tire shop owner is Srbljanovic , and this refers to Biljana Srbljanovic , famous Serbian dramatic writer . Politically , she is very active as left oriented liberal , and she despises Kusturica 's political views and anarchism . Kusturica 's ' everything but not subtle ' take to her work was to castrate Miki Manojlovic in Srbljanovic shop . Second reference is made to Goran Bregovic  previous Kusturica 's composer . He formed ' Funeral and wedding orchestra ' and start performing around Europe . Although he is praised as big composer , Bregovic is just performer and most of his songs ( if not all ) are poor covers of traditional Serbian songs . Kusturica 's take on Bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral , with funeral mocking the wedding . Also , music is covering western classics as ' London Bridge is falling down ' or French lullabies . You find this unfunny ? Now you see how we feel in Serbia when listening Bregovic 's horrible covers . I really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep , it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody , and it is beautifully directed , as all of his works are . If you like previous Kusturica 's movies , there is a big chance that you will hate this . If you do n't like couple of his last movies , you may find this as pleasant surprise , because this is like Fellini directing ' Pink Flamingos ' . On purpose . I have massive respect for this guy after ' Zavet ' . Next Tim Burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces . Next Kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading Earth . That 's the reason why he is most interesting director on Earth , whether you like it or not .
1 It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations , characters and jokes of ' Zavet ' as well as of many other films of Kusturica . See for example the opening scenes , with the remote village in the Serbian mountains , with the low - tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants , the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule , and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn . Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies , but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case . It 's a fun film before all . Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about . Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies . His style is direct and grotesque , we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same . The space he develops melds present , history and magic , and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema.<br /><br />This is not a perfect film either . The principal flaw is the length , some editing and shortening would have been useful , as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up . It is yet one of the most catching , amusing , moving films that I have seen lately .
1 The movie celebrates life.<br /><br />The world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has " Happy End " , just like in the closing scene of the movie.<br /><br />The movie has wonderful soundtrack , mixture of Serbian neofolk , Gypsy music and jazz.<br /><br />This movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics.<br /><br />The watching experience is like you 've been sucked in another colorful , romantic and sometimes rough world.<br /><br />Like Mr. Kusturica movie should be .
1 Not for people without swift mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins . If You do n't have any of these You can not understand it . And if you do n't understand , you ca n't enjoy it . :) For example if you think Picasso is a name of a car produced by Citroen , probably if you see a Picasso 's painting you just will walk by it , deciding that it 's a trash - work of some street painter . :) So do not judge , before trying to understand it :) In the end i think it 's a MUST for every one with open minds . Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption ! And remember that not all things can be put in frames . Because there are things in this world , that any frame just wo n't fit .
1 I gave this film 8 out of 10 , reserving 10 for e.g Amadeus , and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire most recently . This film is close to Slumdog , but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding Balkan life , mentality and a soul which Kusturica presents masterfully . To understand it you really need to be one of Balkan . This is an amazing movie , much better and more contemporary of his previous films , which are boring at this time , I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie . I like humour ( Balkan humour ) , photography is an art itself , each scene is artistic to the limit . Plot is probably a fairy tale , do n't recall it now , but remember reading to my daughter - going - to sleep a similar story .
1 Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances , one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine . Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially " stage " dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers , and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film . Best of all : the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio / TV husband - wife comedy career , doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s . ( George was once a tap dance instructor ) . Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the film , and worth waiting for . The first soft shoe trio is a warm - up for the " Chin up " exhilarating carnival number , in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions . It almost seems spontaneous . Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing up under the " plot " . I 've seen this one 4 or 5 times , and find the fast forward button helpful .
1 First of all , in defense of JOAN FONTAINE , it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly miscast as Alyce , the young British lady who has the title role . Fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here , but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned . Fortunately , she went on to better things.<br /><br />But here it 's FRED ASTAIRE , GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the top billing -- and they are excellent . Fans of Burns & Allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into Astaire 's dance routines . Especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer Hermes Pans an Oscar . They join Astaire in what has to be the film 's most inventive highlight.<br /><br />Unfortunately , not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story -- nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer . It must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment . Only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs.<br /><br />Some pleasant Gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve . The nice supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner , at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant , Constance Collier and Montagu Love ( as Joan 's father mistaken as a gardener by Astaire).<br /><br />It 's a lighthearted romp whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days . Both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with Astaire 's footwork.<br /><br />Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine 's hillside dance number with Fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera - work can not disguise the fact that she is out of her element as Astaire 's dance partner , something she seems painfully aware of .
1 I could n't wait to get my hands on this one , when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins . It is definitely worth seeing , but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book , where the humor comes across better . Some of the acting is downright painful to watch ( notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But ... ! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies . I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance , but boy does she in this movie . Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels ! She keeps up wonderfully with Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several nice songs , particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Astaire , Burns & Allen . I had to go back and re - watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled .
1 In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens , George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS : that is , he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career . This would not have been too difficult for Dickens . His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that , only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set ( MR . FANCY ROMFORD 'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels ) . Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable . Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man ( and do n't forget , his first book , SKETCHES BY BOZ , was also a funny book ) . So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST ( which got pretty grim at points ) . Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books . Dickens would definitely ( and successfully ) have agreed to that.<br /><br />But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows . Surtees , as I said , is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting . But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer , poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system . His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being ... well Earl of Emsworth ! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior . His Stanley Uckridge will always have a " perfect " scheme that should net a huge profit ( but always manages to come apart at the end ) . And best of all , his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster , his boss . Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow . They served ( and still serve ) their purposes . In fact , compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh , who also wrote funny books , but of a more intellectual type . The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature : BRIDESHEAD REVISITED , DECLINE AND FALL , and the rest . But in his determination to make his points , if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed . For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD . While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too , his falling did not go as far as Waugh 's did.<br /><br />Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist ( when you hear " Bill " in the score of SHOWBOAT , it is not Kern and Hammerstein 's tune , but Kern and Wodehouse 's tune transposed from " Oh Lady , Lady " a dozen years earlier ) . He was a handy dramatist too . So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here.<br /><br />It has the normal Wodehouse touches . That perfect butler Keggs ( Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance ) is a scoundrel in rigging a " friendly " gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads . He is also unable to refrain , occasionally , from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Collier 's attempts to control his impulse . This is typical Wodehouse characterization . So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert , both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash . Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch , with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest.<br /><br />Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with . It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together ( such as SIX OF A KIND and WE'RE NOT DRESSING ) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire . The Fun House sequence , which includes the song " Stiff Upper Lip " , is wonderful , as is an earlier sequence where the three do a " whisk broom " dance ( that Astaire learned from Burns ) . But Gracie 's marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner ( see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs / Gardiner 's mistake , and looks at Gardiner as though he 's either stupid or mad ) . Her dialog with Lady Caroline ( Collier ) 's son Reggie ( Ray Noble , the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her , but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too.<br /><br />The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it , and the weakness of Joan Fontaine . Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role , but the flaw is really Wodehouse 's - he did n't make the character very interesting . But the film can stand without that , given the other performers and their characters , Gershwin 's music , and Wodehouse 's marvelous sense of fun .
1 I just have to say , this is one of my favorite movies of all time . I can not even count the number of times I 've seen it . I was already in love with John Travolta , but the first time the camera pans up his body after he 's all clean - shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley 's , I was in awe . Debra Winger , as always , delivers a perfect performance as the young , naive wife of Bud , but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard - working cowboy . If you 're not a country music person , which I was n't , this is 1 soundtrack that 'll have you singing right along with every word . If you get a chance , please see this movie - it wo n't disappoint .
1 * * * * * * * * Spoilers -- Careful*********<br /><br />What can I say ? I 'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy . I love it and have watched it countless times -- and usually find out something new about it with each viewing.<br /><br />I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people , not rich people who live in either L.A. or New York . Well , it is true except for Pam.<br /><br />Travolta plays Bud , a small town Texas boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields . And this is when Travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys / good guys in big budget movies . This is a really good movie -- the mechanical bull riding contest and two - step dancing may be silly , but you have to enjoy this for what it is.<br /><br />Bud meets Sissy ( played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance)--and soon after , they are married and living in their dream trailer . But their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes . Bud wants to be a real cowboy . Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy . But in modern times , men 's roles are not as clear . Where can Bud prove he 's a real man ? He can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night -- he can be a " urban cowboy . " But Sissy wants to drive his pick - up truck , and she wants to ride the mechanical bull , too . So where does this leave Bud ? As Sissy asserts her independence , she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex - con and prison rodeo star -- a real bull rider-- , Wes ( played wonderfully greasy by Scott Glenn ) . Bud is threatened , and Bud and Sissy break up.<br /><br />Sissy shacks up with Wes , who abuses her . Emasculating himself further , Bud becomes the boy toy of Pam , a rich girl whose Daddy is in oil and all that implies . Sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up -- Pam does n't do that kind of thing . She writes a make up letter to Bud , but evil Pam tears it up and takes the credit for Sissy 's housework.<br /><br />Bud 's Uncle Bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion . Bud and Sissy have a chance at reconciliation , but are too stubborn . Later the mechanical bull riding competition is at Gilley 's , and you know Bud is going to win . Pam realizes that Bud does n't love her , but Sissy -- he did it for her . Wes tries to rob Gilleys , but would n't you know that urban cowboy , Bud , saves the day and wins back the woman he loves.<br /><br />Of course , you may ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys about every night and " live like pigs . " Maybe that contributed to their bad marriage . Or why did n't Bud stay with Pam -- she was n't that bad and had money . Or why they had to kill off Uncle Bob . Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends like Marshall and Jessie who were always trying to break them up : Marshall says to Bud , " She { Sissy } rides that bull better than you do ! " But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is making fun of it a little bit -- and saying , is n't that Bonnie Raitt on the stage !
1 Very few movies have had the impact on American culture the way Urban Cowboy has . Thank god it was temporary . But UC is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you 're flipping channels at 3:00AM you just ca n't take your eyes off .... my top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but that 's beside the point . I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner , men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers , and if you did nt know how to two - step you were considered a social moron ! Personally I think it 's a great movie . Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever . Who 'd a thunk . He 's actually believable too . The soundtrack is awesome . Too bad Charlene Tilton , of TV 's Dallas fame ruined Johnny Lee 's career cause that guy was just terrific . The show stealer here is Scott Glenn as the greaser ex - con redneck cowboy . And I ai n't got nothing against greaser ex - con cowboys semi - being one myself , but I 've always envied what I feel to be the greatest power line of all time .... "Pack - at S*#t ! " Sort of like Clint 's " make my day . " And watching him slap Sissy around is the closest thing I 'll see to my Julia Roberts fantasy so ..... Like I said , beautiful . 9/10
1 I must say as a girl with a cowboy of my own , I love this flick . It left me lovin them boots and wranglers even more . I told my friend about it and she loved it just as much , we were 'bout 13 at the time . I think it 's the greatest love story ever told!I own it and never get tired of Bud & Sissy .
1 I did not see this film in the theater . I confess to an anti - Vinnie Barbarino bias . Who the hell was John Travolta to be making movies ? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year , with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he did n't win . How dare he , when there were " real " actors in the running ? I 'm sorry John , you should have won . After catching this film on cable years ago , I fell in love with the entire movie . Bud , Sissy , Uncle Bob , Wes , all wonderfully done . I , also , confess to never passing it by when I channel surf . I HAVE to stop and watch . Over the years , I 've learned to do most of the dialogue , dance with my thumbs in my waistband , and learned to appreciate Travolta more . The only disappointing thing to me was the oversight , on the soundtrack , of some of the music from Urban Cowboy . " Looking for love " defines the film , but Urban Cowboy was chock full of classics that DIDN'T make it to the soundtrack . It should have been a double CD ........
1 While Urban Cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo , it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age , in urban Texas . I also think that to truly critique this movie , one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made . There was good music , fun times and , yes , a few " rough and tumbles " at the honky tonk roadhouses . The relationship of Bud and Sissy , like " two ships passing in the night " , was well conceived . When Pam tore up the note that Sissy had written to Bud , it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances . The entire story was well thought out . I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job . I thought the screen play was well written and directed . Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor .
1 This movie was a classic . I would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes . if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did . It had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life , and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a " BIG THROAT " and swallow are pride .
1 This movie has it all , action , fighting , dancing , bull riding , music , pretty girls . This movie is an authenic look at middle America . Believe me , I was there in 1980 . Lots of oil money , lots of women , and lots of honky tonks . Too bad they are all gone now . The movie is essentially just another boy meets girl , boy loses girl , boy gets girl back , but it is redeemed by the actors and the music . There is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie , and that includes American Graffiti . It is a movie I watch over and over again and never get tired of it . Every time I watch it , I am young again , and it is time to go out honky tonking . The only reason I only gave it a 9 is because you can not rate a movie zero , I do not feel you should rate one 10 .
