nope one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she does n't want to get caught doing something dirty such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha br br did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off \? nope she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block of course she is n't supposed to enjoy it and that is what i mean about this movie why could n't they have given her something to enjoy \? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong \? br br behind mameha the chairman was sayuri 's secret patron , and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity he could have rigged the auction and won her himself nobu did n't even bid so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and , reeking of old man stink , get his fingers all over her naked body \? would any woman ever really forgive a man for that \? br br let 's try to make sense of this by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri 's geisha training in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr crab through mameha the chairman sold sayuri 's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her the chairman was n't her patron he was her pimp ! some romantic love story br br yes , the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive , alluring transvestite whose voice , appearance and every touch are thrilling but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart , soul , spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie , distortion , and terribly wrong br br some contrasts between japan and moag br br japanese style refined , elegant simplicity moag style peking opera br br japanese geisha hair swept up moag geisha loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup br br japanese shaved ice japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances shaved ice is strictly a summer treat moag shaved ice the chairman buys chiyo , the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo , this treat during cherry blossom viewing season the thought made my entire body shiver with cold br br japanese geisha trained and skilled entertainers moag geisha sluts br br japanese wind chime used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes , thanks to the breeze , japanese people feel somehow cooler moag wind chime a door bell ! if a person stood in front of another 's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic , not gain entrance br br japan emphasis on human relationships , group oriented moag i want a life that 's mine american individualism br br japanese traditional dance refined elegance an almost geometrical and mechanical precision moag dance martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not very auspicious white japanese funeral shroud performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club \? ha ha ha ! is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha \? br br japan house fire setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community fires can rip through those wooden villages , towns , and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people moag house fire great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out of control fire miraculously puts itself out technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled br br enough the movie stinks
