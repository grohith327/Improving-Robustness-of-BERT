\) , is dragged to a sight seeing tour in auschwitz , is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york br br and this is where the story really starts br br bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is 1961 , campbell , jr , lives in new york tenement as a has been and mourns the loss of his wife nobody really cares or do they \? yes , somehow they do , and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him , or is she his wife \? anyway , in the end campbell , jr , calls in at the israeli consulate , and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment , placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann 's he writes his life story and , once this task finished , hangs himself on the typewriter 's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit br br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss , i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly , many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero , having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact , however , the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation , as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story br br one might argue , that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point , primarily , i suspect , because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity , especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee , a talented , versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts \( confession , broadcast and hidden messages \) , but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance

he would n't , period then we also have the bartender 2nd rape dude actually i do n't think you would need him at least not for the 2nd rape , but more about that later on br br let 's reprise the story rosarios character is sexually insecure , might even have lesbian tendencies \( see her scene with a female friend \) this was n't intentional , as rosario states herself , but there is sexual tension between them rosario 's character meets a guy , who is a sexual predator , in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her br br rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts , as if it is her first boyfriend , which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother , here 's another problem after the first rape takes place , rosarios character does n't tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one , nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character would n't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely , the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party , it 's obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone br br the first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a pinch , when you compare it to the ending \( rape \) , which feels like you 're getting hit with a sledge hammer ! after rape no 1 we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened \( such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian , as one guy states who tried to hit on her \) , but left in the open no real social contact is established , if you leave the bartender guy out , who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene it 's apparent that he is n't a nice guy and his character get 's fleshed out a bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again , his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that rosarios character is n't the same anymore , that she went bad and is able to hurt people \( too \) many scenes show exactly that , her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist 1 who cheats on a test , gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again \( really \? \) as absurd as that sounds , the guy meets up with her , not without us having seen him beforehand , with another girl \( very likely that he raped her too , although we never see anything of that , fortunately \) and his football career well career is a stretch and he is bullied this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works , but then again is too clich to stay with you so rapist 1 submits to rosarios character why exactly \? because he promised her , it was her day \? again , really \? a guy like that never loses control , especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something , but letting him submit like that , just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drink br br so rapist 1 undresses and get 's blindfolded and let 's rosarios character tie him on a bed seriously , that 's just crazy ! but what comes next , is even crazier first she talks to him , then she shuts him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this is n't about what this guy deserves or not , it 's just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist 1 if this really should work as a revenge movie , it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job , takes away everything that was built up br br this is n't supposed to be entertaining enjoyable , it 's a hard watch it is art house but the 10 minute \( i did n't count \) rape scene at the end , just smashes everything rosarios character is more or less , only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointment br br irreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene , but the movie went on \( even if it was back into time \) rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first , that comes a bit too late , that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly , this is where the art house movie should 've come in it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope , with what she had done but then again , she did n't actually physically do that much \( see above \) a broken character that the movie cuts off br br good intentions \( talia and rosario had worked before \) , but failing to convey most of the things , they set out to do \( even if you can see what they meant , it has to be convincing , otherwise it does n't work \) not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are

orig sent (0):	this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lame the story is very weak , and there is little action most of the characters are given little to nothing to do the movie is mildly entertaining at best , but really does n't go any where and is pointless it 's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the 80 's it 's not a movie that bears repeat viewing , at least in my mind it 's only about 74 minutes long including credits , so i guess that 's a good thing unlike in the tv show , the characters are not worth rooting for here in the show , you wanted inspector gadget to save the day , but there , who really cares \? anyway , that 's just my opinion for me inspector gadget 's last case is a disappointing 3 10

orig sent (0):	to be clear from the get go , ' the bagman ' is very , very , very bad it suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that it 's actually hysterically funny to watch this is a very low grade film budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence i 'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not for example , the movie takes place in ' doomsville ' note to all prospective home buyers if the town you 're moving to is called ' doomsville , ' keep moving stephanie beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen i could n't help but laugh because it has intentional humour \( she turns on the gas stove get it \? the sex is that hot \? get it \? \) and unintentional humour the unintentional in this case is the music it 's like the theme music for ' chariots of fire ' goes electronica break out the computer and the synthesizers ! i realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive i really feel for them because the work here is so well intentioned the problem is that cheap music is n't necessarily good music i have n't laughed so hard at sex on screen since ' alone in the dark ' with that ' seven seconds ' song \( i guess they were implying that poor old mr slater was a bit quick on the draw \? \) even the end credits are hilarious intentional or not \? you be the judge a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast and an animal wrangler was on set for them ! the boom is credited to ' mr b stick , ' and the 3rd unit 's wardrobe \( yep , they had a third unit \) is credited to k mart maybe it 's just me , but i think the hilarity of this more than saves the film the movie is very , very bad , but the goals of stephanie beaton , her friends and family are so well intentioned in ' the bagman ' that you ca n't help but like the movie they 've produced ' the bagman ' is bad but not dreadful in its own sweet way , it even manages to be a bit endearing it wears its flaws so honestly that you ca n't help but forgive them better films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way i guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly br br watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this some of them might look cheaper , or have worse acting , or sillier production value they may not suffer terribly as ' the bagman ' does from awful editing , sound , and foley effects mr b stick did n't do a very good job the special effects look to be where most of the money went they tend to be more funny than gruesome , although when the ' bagman ' is finally unmasked at the end , the make up job there is surprisingly well done br br my 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot this is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves b movie or low budget film aficionados all others should probably avoid with great prejudice

orig sent (0):	spoilers this was an ugly movie , and i 'm sorry that i watched it like jan kounen 's dobermann , it suffers mostly from poor editing or lack of it it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention , he added all of the footage he had shot together there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie one of them is spoiler when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him that was cool but okay , we got it ! move on please ! the camera wo n't stop spinning around this guy ! there 's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity , but the last duel scene is not one of them ! it may be because unlike in the earlier sword handling scenes , shanao is n't masked but just because the director could n't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu does n't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme close ups of sword clashes ! and all from the same angle , may i add the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet train ninja movie the hunted ! i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years the situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media , due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority the movie versions of gto and salary man kintaro are two other recent examples end spoiler i do n't understand i just do n't understand why people who do n't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this maybe the worst was lost in the translation br br the ending of the movie on which marketing played a lot , is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between shanao and benkei but that legend is not the most popular in japanese folklore , and it is so detached from contemporary themes , that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques , who cares how the director wants to re interpret the story ! \? director sasaki hirohisa of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences , and target their movies for foreign film festivals in order to gain faster international fame this works , although it does n't make sense , because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries what kind of movies people watch in those countries certainly not gojoe and the like

orig sent (0):	in 1914 , charlie chaplin began making pictures these were made for mack sennett \( also known as keystone studios \) and were literally churned out in very rapid succession the short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed as a result , the films , though popular in their day , were just awful by today 's standards many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing and , regardless of the outcome , keystone sent them straight to theaters my assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad , as the keystone films with chaplin were very successful br br the charlie chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in chaplin 's career with keystone by 1915 , he signed a new lucrative contract with essenay studios and the films improved dramatically with chaplin as director however , at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable no , chaplin as the cute little tramp was still evolving in 1916 , when he switched to mutual studios , his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy in many of the previous films he was just a jerk \( either getting drunk a lot , beating up women , provoking fights with innocent people , etc \) the final evolution of his little tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full length films br br it 's interesting that this film is called twenty minutes of love since the film only lasts about 10 minutes ! oh well the plot , what little there is , involves the little tramp in the park a couple wants to neck but inexplicably , charlie insists on practically sitting on the couple 's lap and really annoying them i ca n't understand why and the short consists of charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film perhaps he was looking for a threesome , i do n't know but the film lacks coherence and just is n't particularly funny even when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake a typical poor effort before chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality
