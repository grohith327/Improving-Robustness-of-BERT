o'dell replies , well , why did n't you say so \? the music , composed by mark isham , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood rollicking 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by the coasters and buddy holly , occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners the film , photographed by fred murphy , also uses colors to set moods and symbolize the town of coalwood , actually filmed in tennessee , is washed with blues , grays , and browns it 's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything faces , clothes , houses , and roads when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red the red stands out enough against the blue gray world of coalwood to symbolize getting out , but it is still subtle the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal , hope , and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer 's stubborn father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket building , is aware that the town is dying with the community disintegrating , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' demonstrations again , i 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism \?

o'dell replies , well , why did n't you say so \? the music , composed by mark isham , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood rollicking 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by the coasters and buddy holly , occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners the film , photographed by fred murphy , also uses colors to set moods and symbolize the town of coalwood , actually filmed in tennessee , is washed with blues , grays , and browns it 's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything faces , clothes , houses , and roads when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red the red stands out enough against the blue gray world of coalwood to symbolize getting out , but it is still subtle the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal , hope , and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer 's stubborn father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket building , is aware that the town is dying with the community disintegrating , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' demonstrations again , i 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism \? october sky has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real

orig sent (1):	i studied charlotte bronte 's novel in high school , and it left me with a stunning impression here was a beautiful novel about a young woman 's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england this young woman was jane eyre , a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own her story , which bronte told through jane 's own eyes , was both sad and inspiring br br as part of our study , we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story , and it blew me away the mini series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte 's original text and the essence of the story , but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great both zelah clarke \( jane eyre \) and timothy dalton \( jane 's lover , by the name of rochester \) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters i can not imagine anyone else in their roles \( the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion , energy , and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre , but she captures jane 's quiet , but firm and passionate nature brilliantly she holds in her emotions , like the jane of the book , at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane 's passionate scenes the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester 's devoted relationship \) as well , the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly , and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story br br i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale if you have not read the book before , then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story

orig sent (1):	i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released prince does n't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything , he 's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here , he 's just the best one to tell this story through influence most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors writers fault , still it is a great movie with even better music the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art

orig sent (1):	what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that , while perhaps lacking in substance , still provides great entertainment throughout it 's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction , rounders and roadkill i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i 've already seen from the director , it would be well worth watching and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of the plot focuses on the overly moral michael a man travelling across america looking for work he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county only catch is that the job is to murder a man 's wife he 's been mistaken for a killer named lyle , but instead of doing the job he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway however , his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up br br john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road he did it three years earlier with kill me again , and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill it 's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location , as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one dahl also provides his film with a ' film noir ' like atmosphere , as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters the acting is largely very good , with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role , and getting a class support from lara flynn boyle , j t walsh and , of course , dennis hopper who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance it has to be said that the second half of the film is n't as gripping as the first , but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it overall , red rock west is a film that you 're unlikely to regret watching it 's thrilling throughout , and you ca n't ask for much more than that !

orig sent (1):	love hurts that , i think , is the main message mike binder 's newest film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant , or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years , or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world , love hurts the great thing about this film , however , is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go , but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they ca n't free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe , but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9 11 effected us all , ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret br br this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish , pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor , but also can be used to show a repressed man , shy and shutout to the world around him a man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 9 11 that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result , he became reclusive and started to believe he could n't remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him , those that love him , try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family , he goes through life with his ipod and headphones , shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember br br reign over me is not about charlie fineman though , it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony , johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle , johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie , by chance , one day , his life evolves into something he has n't felt in 15 years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle 's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler 's does n't mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men

actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely , but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist , but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting , perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective , even writer director

or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance , not to lead us emotionally , \( why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end , i do n't know , but it did unfortunately stick out for me \) reign over me is a film about love and how although it
