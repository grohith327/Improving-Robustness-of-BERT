orig sent (0):	this documentary begins with an interesting premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth sadly , though , after priming us with this , the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non stop attack on christianity , and pretty much focusing on the easy targets br br the writer director clearly has some issues with the church \( he is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger \) and this film seems to be his form of release it 'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded , but as a whole , the movie is disappointing

orig sent (0):	first let me state that i do not believe in god \( if you want to use the word atheist , fine , but i do n't like that word since it describes what i 'm not , not what i am \) but i hated this documentary the production values were damn near non existent , the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian flemming 's insecurities br br the production values were terrible and brian flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best the narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot , and he did n't practice at all there were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie animation was also pretty damn bad br br the whole idea that jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars as i stated before , i do not believe in god , and i do n't think that whether or not jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of god my personal view , jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah 's \( look up apollonius of tiana \) and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death according to the wikipedia article on the historicity of jesus \( and there 's a good citation for this so it 's garbage \) virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that jesus was a jewish teacher from galilee who was regarded as a healer , was baptized by john the baptist , was accused of sedition against the roman empire , and on the orders of roman governor pontius pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion 1 i was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director 's insecurities than anything else i was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else the most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal he 's not even coy about it the way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while i agree with the director partially , that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing , the way that flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going , if he was more tactile with his interview instead he comes off aggressive with is n't it bad to teach kids this stuff the guy cuts the interview short and i mean , what did he expect , the principal to say oh yes , i see it is , i have seen the light , this will now be a secular school \? it seems that flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood this is n't about the documentary , this is about flemming 's insecurities , and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary flemming shows what he 's really doing here , and that is the real downfall of this so called documentary
adv sent (1):	first gotta me states that i expect not believe in god \( if you want to use the word atheist , ok , but i do n't maybe that noun until it describing what i 'm not , not what i am \) but i loathed this documentary the production worthwhile were silly tight non discrete , the premise impossibly erratic and whole nothing thought to need an exercise in brian flemming 's eccentricities br br the producers terms were terrible and brian flemming is hardly an amateurish acting at well the riveting sounded like he just narrated over the scenes all in one shooting , and he took n't practice at all there were ground to numerous umms and paused when he ought ha been conversation in the film animate was also quite silly rotten br br the whole ideas that christ is a mythic nature is not picked severely by history and scriptural researchers as i confirmed before , i might not believing in gods , and i might n't thought that whether or not christ was a actual men said nothing about the exists of gods my confidential visualise , christ maybe was a actual men but he resided in a done where there were numerous massiah 's \( see up apollonius of tiana \) and that the tales of his lives and sermon were blew out of proportionate the anyplace you get from his deaths indicated to the bio mention on the historicity of christ \( and there 's a excelent citations for this anything it 's refuse \) practically all researchers in the field of scriptural study and histories convinced that christ was a catholic tutors from nazareth who was considered as a healers , was christened by james the methodist , was indicted of uprising against the romans empire , and on the ordering of romans governors pilate pontius was convicted to deaths by baptism 1 i was leaving presume at the ends of the documentaries if this was more about the directors 's insecurity than anything else i was leaving idea if he was attempting to persuade himself more than anyone else the most tell examples of this is the last interviews he was with the clergy schooling principal he 's not even cagey about it the manner he bombards the educator is unjust and while i glad with the directors partly , that teach kid about heck fires is a rotten doubt , the manner that flemming faced the principals was just awkward to watching flemming ha a opportunity to potentially got a excelent discuss go , if he was more tactile with his interviews rather he is off agressive with is n't it nasty to taught kid this things the man slices the interviews short and i meaning , what took he expecting , the principal to said yeah oh , i thou it is , i ha seeing the shine , this should now being a secular college \? it seem that flemming is getting avenging for what he feel was a awry putting to him in adulthood this is n't about the documentaries , this is about flemming 's insecurity , and ha nothing to might with the reasons theme of the documentaries flemming illustrates what he 's truly done here , and that is the actual devastates of this yet called documentary

did he want the sex to tell the stories , or did he believe the characters would \? he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two , absolute unknowns , of this film i have to give jang some credit for trying , but not much he attempted to create some sub stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking , but they just could n't congeal well together y 's brother and j 's wife were those plot points , but again , due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element , these stronger sub stories became un rememberable and down right dull maybe it was just how i viewed this film , but outside of the sexual scenes , nothing else worked together we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed br br finally , i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us , the viewers , closer to the emotions being felt by j and y from what i can remember , and i am trying to push this film far from my mind , i do n't remember any musical undertones gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character 's beings while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself , there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more technically , this was a poor film obviously an independent film in nature , it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature i did n't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above , i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough this was no larry clark production this was sub par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release ! br br overall , i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy , but i felt this film was rushed , repetitive , and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived our characters were uneventful , our story was underdeveloped , and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex to me , jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic and it failed miserably this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make br br grade out of

orig sent (0):	i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter 's episode in season 2 because his first , cigarette burns , was by far the best from season 1 \( and i did like other episodes from that season \) oh , how i was disappointed br br in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing the characters , aside from the subject matter , seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker , texas ranger the acting was bad , and i normally like ron perlman a lot , but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible i 'm not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror \( obviously \) with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion in this case , not surprisingly , it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti abortionists and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing br br while i do n't think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for there are a couple small bits that i found nice , hence the 2 stars i gave it br br the actual gore and monster effects were good , but the cgi gore \( two separate gunshots to the head \) were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should 've never been given the ok i 'm generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle i have a problem with the execution of it the technology , while amazing in some respects , is not good enough to match real effects , whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and or alive , and therefore should n't be used until they are cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated br br i 'll also take this opportunity to note that the show title , masters of horror , is a bad title to have there simply are n't many actual masters of horror around maybe two or three if the show were called tale of horror or something like that it would be fine but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes , and therefore being criticized for not being a master of horror is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career and it did n't even have to be a good one

seen in the pattern of the two movies connection has french gangsters invading new york , with the french style smothering the american thriller this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure , and irresolution of plot the baddie got away br br two has the american returning to france , with american thriller values imposed on the native genre the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved this is further dramatised in doyle 's relationship with french inspector barthelmy , whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot br br two seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero from the start , doyle 's importance is diminished at every turn despite the ending of connection , he is considered a hero but he is an american in a foreign land , and his inability to control language or customs means he can not dominate the plot he even misreads the signs of the police force , mistaking an informer for a criminal , and getting him killed br br a detective 's power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret , but doyle spends much of the movie being watched , controlled , an object , a body \( literally in the scenes after he is dumped by charnier \) to be viewed and interpreted in connection , he instigated the action , chasing the criminals , forcing the plot here he is passive , tied to a bed , locked in a cell , an addict , a dependent br br this loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun , and the film follows a depressingly familiar oedipal trajectory in the heroin sequences , he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son his drugged state is like a return to the womb , robbed of adult pressures her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state , doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precision br br oedipus was the first detective , and to avoid his fate , doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity , and kill the father \( charnier \) so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s \( ironically instigated by a frenchman , jacques lacan \) , but it 's rare to see a film so literally full of it br br if all of these facts tended towards the minimising of doyle , then the film 's style does n't friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation , focusing on the mechanics of plot here , doyle is a very conventional hollywood hero instead of being lost in murky long shot , he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices point of view shots , close ups , connecting shots etc br br two is all about the fall and rise of popeye doyle plot in this case is subservient to the acting , which is the usual hackman showiness the cold turkey scenes , therefore , despite their tediousness , are not disturbing we are allowed to share rather than coldly observe this a far less discomforting experience the scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very american br br so while connection tried to imitate the complex thrillers of jean pierre melville , two does the complete opposite melville 's le samourai featured a gangster who started the film whole , powerful , outside language , and charted his eventual disintegration two starts with a disintegrated character , achieved partly through inability with language , whose dominance begins when he steps outside language the concluding action sequences are largely wordless br br in the film , the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective , but as he regains his power \( figured in the return of his gun , and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability , the tower block where charnier held him \) , the marseilles setting becomes more

orig sent (0):	an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans , it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face , namely that we 'll all be dead in a few hundred years , which is already indisputable , but who cares , humans are selfish , destructive creatures , i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction i 'll just call it a natural progression let the apocalypse begin , but meanwhile , we have to listen to the same brazen , slanted politicians who propose another new society , well , do n't be fooled , we 'll all still be controlled by the wealthy , by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place nothing will ever change br br al gore , whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film , as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer , he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion , the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle , tobacco , pig farming \( which accounts for methane gas traces \) and who knows what else , his wealth is predicated on exploitation , greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate , but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party , that is all , meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he 's lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques \? he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets , uses product placed computers in the documentary , and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue he 's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares , he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister \( from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things \) did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines \? no everything must serve the economy , so why is he any different , the answer is he is not br br his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous , all this while he 's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes well mr gore , why do n't you try living like the common people then \?

orig sent (0):	as a huge fan of horror films , especially j horror and also gore i thought nekeddo bur ddo sounded pretty good i researched the plot , read reviews , and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed the plot was ridiculous and did n't even make sense and left too much unexplained , the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying , and what was with the cartoon style sound effects \? the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it i did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light , they left both pretty unexplained , or perhaps i missed it as my mind could n't understand what i was actually seeing i appreciate the way it was supposed to be shocking and a few scenes \( the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing \? \) certainly were , i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way , they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends , but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value , but do n't be expecting a dark , deeply scary and horrifying film you 'll just be disappointed if this was a horror comedy spoof i 'd probably rate it about a nine , the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife 's stomach and closed up her wounds , but as a horror sadly i gave it a one

orig sent (0):	i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind teasing message should look like definitely , the broken is not one of those movies i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i 've read in prior comments , they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain it 's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless so , you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue had the clues been planted more in the movie , one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed but though the movie was so slow in pace , it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all and the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments furthermore , if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end , then how come she is the evil one \? i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages ! they 're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest , i guess horror movies should have blood , screams , intensity , skeletons , body organs and parts because that is the real horror and it 's never away from reality i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of for instance , the horror movie train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with hostel , it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them br br and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message , it is still very poorly presented and the least scary i prefer the addiction message presented in requiem for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex , tv , safety being pampered , etc can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial , are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply do n't like this genre but this does n't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils , ecstasy , leadership lessons \( believe it or not ! \) , entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life , as ugly and scary as it may seems , death !
