orig sent (0):	this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen i 'm not exaggerating , i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves the only thing interesting about this movie is the box on the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so i figured eh whatever , if this was made recently i 'm sure the directing at least wo n't be too bad , but after i saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about , it 's some nonsense from the early 1980 's that he made great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers br br anyway , i think that they just liked the name zodiac killer , and did n't bother to research any of the actual zodiac 's crimes or his mo , or even the years that he was active all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the stories about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiac 's crimes did they also compare the zodiac to vampire of dusseldorf fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritz 's son quite often the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike , and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people , not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks none of the haarman facts are correct either , just a bunch of jumbled nonsense his son even says do n't forget , his name was fritz haarman with 2 t 's his actual name just has one ! i think that the writer director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman ooh those sound like cool names , let 's make a movie about them without doing any outside research ! great idea ! br br perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsm iv and getting cured of it i was also diagnosed with dsm iv and have since recovered , etc for those of you who do n't know , dsm iv is the psychological manual for mental disorders if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems ! haha br br anyway , my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list , and it 's rare that a movie ever reaches that point but , if you are interested in watching a totally non fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring , full of inexperienced actors , and not completely rational , i 'd say check out this movie br br oh , and i liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice nice touch

br br and just in case pat has forgotten , i have n't forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany honestly , to compare his plight to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable speaking of which , need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals \? of course , history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history if he was pinocchio , his nose would encircle the earth br br unfortunately , more and more people continue to believe him every day this is your wake up call , people the 700 club is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history it 's evil masquerading as good it 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing it 's bigoted filth that tries to look clean , pretty , and loving it 's living proof that hateful , dangerous religious views are n't confined to certain groups in the middle east even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught , and if jesus was to appear to this club , he would n't be emulating them instead , he 'd be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president if he did , he 'd be the harbinger of armageddon and not on the side of the good guys

orig sent (0):	when i first saw this film , i thought it should have come from the children 's section it 's very fun and at times humorous , and is actually quite a good story , but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein , and his performance is extraordinary , but that 's the sole exception this film appears a bit forced , the directing lacks substance , and oh yeah the music is ridiculously awful , it did n't put me in a very good mood but if you are not expecting a smart , well crafted comedy romance tale , then this certainly can be entertaining , like i said it should be in the children 's section einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins ' boring , almost tense quest to steal meg ryan 's heart a very conflicting film , but as long as it 's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie
