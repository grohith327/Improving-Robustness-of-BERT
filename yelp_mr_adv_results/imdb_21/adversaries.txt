orig sent (0):	first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman in this film , you will not see a single sailing boat you will not see sailors , ghosts , or anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship , and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i would n't have watched it , because i really thought it was the film about the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship , since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the flying dutchman legend i do n't understand why it is maybe based on the resembling legend called the wandering jew \? or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend \? the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately , it is the only battle scene of the film then you see daniel emilfork \( who was krank in city of lost children \) for about two seconds , and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting unfortunately he is very bad in the film the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi , who was one of italia 's best actors ever , and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film and boy , does that film need wiseness ! every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement , yelling , torturing others \( in excrement \) , fornicating \( in excrement \) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another coming from a dutch director , you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece , elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven 's film , flesh blood , such a great film the thought of flesh blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good unfortunately , and unlike flesh blood , there is no dramatic progression , no fights , no good acting , and put simply , no flesh and blood the photography , as the opening sequence unfolds , is well done and enticing this too , stops very early in the film the music , from nicola piovani \( of la vit e bella fame \) is repetitive and annoying , when not irrelevant \( it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence , while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung \) throughout the first act of the film , which lasts nothing less than an hour \( ! \) , the film takes place within the same perimeter , which is around the farm where the main characters live the characters play with excrement a lot , drown in it , play in it a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character , a young boy who loves to play in excrement , to become older and play in excrement some more the bird man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish conquistadors speak french nothing makes sense everything is confused and takes hours to happen then there is a second act called the ship , in which we see what might have been a ship , a long time ago , but which is now remains of a ship \( covered with excrement did i mention \? \) the main character , while walking a bit further away from the farm , just happens to run into it , and decides it 's really cool so let 's live in it the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him , but he does n't really mind because \( did i mention \? \) he 's not very bright he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it , until more conquistadors show up \( at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i 've said it 's really confused who 's who \) , make the dutchman a prisoner , along with the retarded hunchback , and they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film , which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle age peasants fighting in it , takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with feces yet more loitering for the director , who seems to have definitely given up on his job , or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the end , a lot of the mentally challenged new friends that the dutchman made die the woman he had sex with who was his brother 's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son the dutchman and his son talk the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends , while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they do n't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses

br br apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all br br another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story most were in the film for 5 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverine br br fred dukes \( the blob but not the comic version \) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all , but a simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him \? br br cyclops optic beams \( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers \) can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes adamantium trench coats anyone \? br br the \( gravity defying \) mutant gambit , instead of utilizing his signature cards , is made into some sort of crazy acrobat in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverine then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running towards wolverine how he regained consciousness , ran away a few blocks , climbed up a building , then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained br br some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect br br the comic book source material , the real origin of wolverine is a story worth bringing to the screen it does n't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies it is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time , began with weapon x by barry windsor smith a much more intense and exciting story br br this fox film should seriously be forgotten br br anyone have that magic gun \?

orig sent (0):	the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hit man who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill , indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers , this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell , the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war , driving jeeps , shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters ! the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive , sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wo nt spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment , the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception

orig sent (0):	i have three comments to make about this film , which i discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at blockbuster first off , it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works some have , as kubrick did with lolita , gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work of course that ca n't happen here kraft ebing is long dead some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new , unrelated direction \( the recent adaptation of tristram shandy comes to mind here \) you can dumb it down the film of slaughterhouse five is to my mind an example of that or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes that would be the approach of woody allen 's everything you wanted to know about sex , and , arguably , this film upon consideration , it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like psychopathia sexualis the potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed and so it is here br br point two is the cinematic style some would call it an homage to murnau , pabst , carl dreyer , etc , but i think it more crude than that its far too heavy handed and self conscious to be effective for long it is eventually just annoying br br point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation how did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring \? i found the film impossible to pay attention to , and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well i do n't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless , but i have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material , the overt copying of filmic styles , and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level \( possibly for fear of being accused of titillation \) br br the film is a dubious exercise from the start and does n't really work for me , i 'm sorry to say

orig sent (0):	i loved the curse of frankenstein so much that i rushed out to get frankenstein must be destroyed to see cushing at it again even if it was without chistopher lee this time to my great disappointment , this movie not only does without lee , but it does without frankenstein 's monster altogether ! was it a case of if we ca n't get lee , we wo n't have a monster at all \? why would they do that \? the monster is half the fun of the whole thing ! ! this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum i found the script extremely weak , with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much i 'm willing to suspend a fair amount , but this movie got fairly ridiculous , which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it br br peter cushing , though , is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men , he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well the supporting cast is competent , but has little to do , even the young doctor and his fianc e blackmailed into helping frankenstein a bumbling police chief is introduced , along with his put upon sidekick , to generate some comic relief , then they are completely dropped from the movie ! why \? we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron , then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor , and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein 's brain transplant experiment there was no tension , we were n't invested in the creature , and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel br br also , there are virtually no horror elements yes , there is a beheading in the beginning \( off camera \) , and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men 's skulls off \( again , off camera \) , and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene \( 90 of which is , again , off camera \) i understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all , for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show , but come on , if you 're not going to give us a monster , then at least let us see the few horrific elements you do choose to include showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary br br on top of a weak script , i thought the directing was mostly flat there were a couple of nice shots , but otherwise no excitement , atmosphere , or suspense was generated the same director did curse back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was br br the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushing 's powerful , nuanced performance beyond that , i found little in this movie worth recommending instead , my suggestion is to watch the curse of frankenstein and see a truly great hammer horror film
